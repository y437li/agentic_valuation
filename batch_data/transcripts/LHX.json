Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Chris Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Quarter 1 2014 Harris Earnings Conference Call. My name is Matthew, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. I'm Pamela Padgett, and on the call with me today is Bill Brown, President and CEO; Gary McArthur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press release and on this teleconference and the related presentation, we will discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the tables of our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of this call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, Bill, I'll turn the call over to you. William M. Brown: Okay, well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report a positive start to the fiscal year. Previous restructuring actions and our continuing focus on the things we control in this challenging government environment, such as improving operational excellence, driving free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders led to solid results with higher earnings per share and significantly higher free cash flow. We also had some key wins, which I'll touch on in a minute, and our book-to-bill for the company was slightly higher than 1. Turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation. Earnings per share was $1.18, up 4%; on revenue, down 6%. We generated $139 million of free cash flow compared to $77 million in the prior year with a conversion rate of 109% of income. And we continue to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders during the quarter, increasing our dividend to 13.5%, spending $100 million in cash to repurchase shares and approving a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Over the past year, as we restructured and focused on operational excellence to lower cost, we also continued to invest in the future. We increased R&D investment in fiscal '13 by about 5%, and it was up again in the first quarter. And we focused our R&D spend on the most strategic and highest-return projects. This strategy is beginning to bear fruit, and I thought I'd point out a few specific examples that provide some insight into our future competitiveness. By investing R&D resources in a 2-channel tactical radio system, we were successful in winning the Army's highly-contested $141 million Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio Procurement, called MNVR. As you well know, this replaces the canceled JTRS program, ground mobile radio or GMR. Our solution for MNVR is based on our Falcon III radio. With more than 45,000 units fielded around the world, it's the most widely-deployed wideband radio in the market. And just as Harris was first to have a government SRW Waveform certified and working in a radio, MNVR will be the first production radio to deploy the government's wideband networking waveform WNW. Initial shipments will be in time for the Army's network integration evaluation 15.1 in the fall of 2014, and over the next 10 years, the Army has budgeted about $600 million to spend on mid-tier radios. We're also focusing investment on other upcoming JTRS procurements, and we're pleased to hear that the Army is moving back towards a multi-vendor acquisition strategy for both the manpack and the Rifleman Radio, an approach, we believe, is in the best interest of the war fighter and the taxpayer, as competition drives innovation, speed to market and cost-effective solutions. We officially launched our 2-channel manpack radio at last week's AUSA. Our radio weighs less and is 1/3 smaller than competitor radios, has a simple keypad-driven user interface familiar to some 45,000 current tactical radio users, and has the ability to support the full suite of waveforms without requiring expensive add-on appliques. Our Rifleman Radio offering is the U.S. equivalent to our international Soldier Radio, of which more than 44,000 have been already fielded around the world. Our U.S. product, the RF-330E wideband team radio, provides significant differentiation from existing radios, including a substantially longer battery life, shorter connect time to the network and a unique dashboard display that provides the user operational and network status at a glance, such as battery time remaining and number of users and where they are on the network. We also stepped up investments on the international front, and in a recent London trade show, announced our entry into the international ground-to-air radio market. Our international offering is a variant of the radio that will compete for the U.S. market's Small Airborne Networking Radio, or SANR procurement, that replaces the previously-canceled JTRS airborne radio program, AMF. So overall, good early returns on a key strategy to increase and focus our R&D spend. As we mentioned in our fourth quarter call, growing revenue in international markets is important to our year, and we've had some pretty positive news on that front. Our international tactical pipeline has increased in value, funding has firmed up as a result of improving relations between the U.S. and Pakistan, and contract vehicles supporting foreign military sales are in place with encouraging recent increases in ceiling value. Earlier this month, we were awarded an $847 million increase in the ceiling value of a sole-source CECOM contract. And you may recall that last third quarter, we received a $500 million ceiling value increase on a similar sole-source contract, giving us some comfort that communications equipment is a spending priority. In Government Communications, we made significant progress on one of our FAA NextGen programs, known as DataComm. Under DataComm, the FAA is transitioning air traffic control from mainly voice communications to specialized data messaging, improving safety and reliability, as well as providing other efficiencies for the airlines, such as saving fuel and reducing arrival and departure times. To jump-start industry adoption early in the DataComm program, the FAA established an incentive program for equipping aircraft with digital Avionics, and Harris has played an integral role working with the FAA to garner industry support for using the incentives to begin equipping airplanes. This quarter, we received a big boost from industry when 5 major U.S. airlines committed to outfit their aircraft with digital Avionics equipment, achieving nearly 80% of the FAA's 6-year target in just the first year of the program. This strong commitment by industry demonstrates that the DataComm program will continue to be a valued and funded component of the FAA's NextGen initiative. In our Integrated Network Solutions segment, we have particularly strong orders in IT Services and made significant progress in strategically expanding our maritime business. Earlier this month, CapRock was awarded in a competitive bid a 5-year contract from Carnival Corporation for satellite voice, data and Internet services across its fleet of 103 ships, dramatically improving bandwidth capacity to meet growing demand from passengers and crew. With this significant award and our previous Royal Caribbean win, we are now the satellite communications provider for the top 2 cruise lines in the world. So overall, a pretty solid start to the year. And now, we'll turn it over to Gary to comment on segment results and guidance for 2014, and then we'll open it up for some of your questions. Gary L. McArthur: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Moving to segment results on Slide 5, RF communication orders were $348 million compared to $363 million in the prior year. Revenue was $423 million compared to $445 million. Book-to-bill was 0.8. In Tactical Communications, orders were $225 million, up in the U.S., but down in international due to timing. Tactical revenue was $305 million and declined 1% compared to the prior year. The 12- to 18-month international pipeline grew to $2.4 billion, expanding somewhat from the previous quarter's $2.2 billion. The U.S. pipeline is also a bit higher at $1.1 billion compared to the previous quarter's $1 billion. In Public Safety, revenue was weak at $118 million, declining 14%. Orders were $123 million, up 12%, and book-to-bill was greater than 1. The decline in revenue reflects both the general weakness across system and terminal sales in state and local, and from federal government orders booking too late in the quarter to turn to revenue. Public Safety orders in the quarter included $40 million from Mobile County, Alabama, to deploy a P25 emergency communication system, a good win resulting from a growth initiative to migrate customers from existing legacy systems to the P25 interoperable standard. Operating income from the RF Communications segment was $135 million, with a 32% operating margin in the quarter, driven by lower cost and favorable product mix. Turning now to Slide 6 in Integrated Network Solutions. First quarter revenue decreased 3% to $376 million. In CapRock, growth in energy and maritime was more than offset by lower government revenue. In IT Services, while revenue was down 3%, the decline was less than expected. Segment orders were higher than revenue as a result of record orders in IT Services. The outstanding orders performance at IT Services was driven by several wins, $89 million from the VA, $35 million under the U.S. State Department's Consular Affairs Support Services contract, and $22 million from the U.S. Air Force for NORAD and NORTHCOM. Other awards included a $65 million follow-on contract for the U.S. Air Force's Satellite Control Network and a position on the NETCENTS-2 Applications Services IDIQ contract with a ceiling value of $960 million. And following the close of the quarter, we received a $54 million order from the U.S. Navy to extend continuity of services on the Navy Marine Corps Internet (sic) [Intranet] contract through June 2014. In CapRock, we were awarded a 7-year $45 million contract, including options, and received an initial order under this contract of $24 million from an oil and gas equipment services company for the global fleet of offshore service vessels. In health care, we were less successful than expected on government recompetes and new program wins, and the release of our clinical innovation platform version 5.1 software slipped from the planned August launch date. The software has now been released and is operating in a few live environments. So, so far, so good. In Integrated Network Solutions, segment operating income was $30 million, compared with prior year of $33 million. Lower cost were more than offset by the impact of lower revenue and margin pressure from a competitive government market environment. Moving to Slide 7. Revenue in Government Communications was $412 million, decreasing 9% from the prior year, primarily due to the timing of NOAA's GOES-R weather program transitioning to an integration and test phase, and partially from lower revenue from Department of Defense customers. The declines more than offset higher revenue from classified customers and from other civil agency customers including the FAA. Excluding GOES-R, revenue for the rest of the business was flat with the prior year. Awards in the quarter included the 7-year $150 million network services component of the previously won DataComm program that Bill just discussed and a 5-year multi-vendor communications and transmissions system IDIQ contract called CTS from the U.S. Army, with a $4.1 billion ceiling value to provide upgrades and maintenance of the Army's worldwide terrestrial communications networks. Operating income was $64 million and operating margin was strong at 15.5% as a result of very good program performance. Turning to Slide 8. Free cash flow was strong at $139 million versus $77 million last year, and capital expenditures were $33 million compared to $44 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we repurchased about 1.7 million shares of our common stock for a total cash outlay of $100 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. Moving to Slide 9. Fiscal 2014 guidance remains unchanged at a range of $4.65 to $4.85 per diluted share for our income from continuing operations, and a revenue decline of 1% to 3% compared to the prior year. We've also made no changes to segment information, which is detailed on this slide. And with that, we'll turn it back to the operator and open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just a couple of questions. The weakness you saw in the quarter at PSPC, the -- you quoted the system and terminal sales orders are the orders shifting to the right. Does that weakness abate and we return to growth there? Is that what's implied by that statement later in the year? William M. Brown: Yes. We were a little bit weak on revenue. Part of it was, I think, market-driven. Just weakness in systems and terminals for state and local. We also had some orders that came in pretty late in the quarter on the federal side, which didn't make the quarter and shifted into Q2. So that was a factor as well. But you remember back the last couple of years, our book-to-bill has been less than 1 for about 7 or 8 of the last 9 quarters. Decent bookings in Q1, I would say, were up about 12%, 13% and solid book-to-bill in the quarter. And we do expect that over the balance of year, we'll return to growth. As I mentioned last time, our guidance for the year in the Public Safety was mid to high-single digits, certainly coming out of the gates at down 14% puts a little more stretch into the back half, but we still think that this is a growth business. We think the market's growing in the 3% to 5% range. Our biggest competitor in our space did have some challenges like we did in the most recent quarter and seeing the same sort of market phenomenon that we're seeing. But we're making some changes in the way we organize at Public Safety. I think we've added people into sales and marketing, both on the terminals and systems side to drive growth in that space. We're investing in a product offering, and I think, over time, we're going to start to see ourselves come back to full growth, and we do expect that will be towards the back end of the year, Carter. So, thank you. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, great. And on the CECOM, the IDIQ ceiling increase, were there any associated task orders that came with that? Or it was just a ceiling change for now? William M. Brown: These 2 vehicles have been in place for some time. There was a ceiling increase. So we've been, over time, receiving some task orders against each of them. I think what we saw in -- the one we saw back in Q3 of $500 million in the most recent one, is, again, just a little more encouragement, a little more confidence that orders on the FMS side will start to flow through those vehicles. They are still sourced. They're communications-specific, Harris-specific. So that was a, I think, a big vote of confidence in what we expect to see is better growth in the international side through the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : On the margin front, at GCS, you seem to be kind of batting pretty strongly here, kind of opposite story at INS. Maybe you can help us think through how the balance of the year plays out and what was behind the decision not to raise the guidance for GCS margins and not to lower it for INS. William M. Brown: At GCS, we feel really good about the margin progression over the last several years, and we felt great where we ended at fiscal '13 and we feel good about where we came out in the first quarter of fiscal '14 at 15.5%, that's pretty strong. Of course, we're still guiding the 14% for the year. We saw unusually strong product business in the first quarter, and we saw some really good award fees coming through on a number of our programs [ph], particularly on the classified side. Those things you tend not to want to put in the guidance or forecast to repeat through the balance of the year, so we didn't do that. And we do see, over the course of the year, a little less product business, a little more systems and program business, which will be at slightly lower margins. So again, we're 1 quarter into the year. I think we're maintaining a cautious approach for the year and we held our guidance. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : In INS? William M. Brown: In INS, I think we came out of the gates. We saw a pretty good orders at the IT Services business. And as Gary mentioned, we did see an extension to the NMCI contract going for the balance of the year. So we will see some improvement in this segment, just simply because we've got a little bit better performance in the IT Services business. In Q1, both IT Services and CapRock were down modestly year-over-year, margins at Q1. Of course, CapRock was improving sequentially. We saw that improving over the balance of the year. Again, it's a little bit early to change our outlook for the year-end margins for INS. I think we had a, I guess, a solid start coming just around -- just below 8%, 7.9% margin for the INS segment. And I think for now 8% to 10% for the year is about the right range given what we see in our business. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Great. And just one more, if I could. Tactical was good this quarter in terms of the top line. It seems to be trending maybe a little bit above the guidance for the year, which is for -- down, I think, low-single digits. Should we think of that as perhaps being ahead of plan and PSS [ph] business, to Carter's point, maybe being a bit behind? William M. Brown: Well, if you try to extrapolate from Q1, one could draw that conclusion. But with still 1 quarter in the year, and we still have a lot left in it. I think we came out of the gates strongly on tactical. We feel good about that. We had good orders in the DoD side. And of course, the MNVR win was a nice wind at our back, and we feel strong about that. I think the backlog remains pretty healthy in the Tactical business. You may recall we had very strong orders in Q4. We ended the year with very, very good backlog. Of course, with orders being down a little bit and the book-to-bill, as Gary mentioned, at Tactical been less than 1, we saw backlog erosion over the course of the quarter. But you can run the math; it dropped about $80 million sequentially through Q1. But where we stand today, in terms of backlog in Tactical versus where we were 1 year ago, about 8% to 9% higher. And that does give us a little bit more encouragement that we'll see pretty good business this year in tactical radios. And we hope that that might offset what could be more of a stretch in Public Safety in the back half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : So Bill, on the pipeline, which went up both in international and domestic, is that due to the changes in the weightings that you guys give them, given I think, Pakistan, you mentioned that. That seems like probably an important change. And also you mentioned the multi-vendor strategy for JTRS. Were those basically incorporated and that's why they went up? Or was there other drivers? William M. Brown: On the DoD side, it came up, I'd say, modestly year-over-year. Last time, it was about $1 billion, now it's about $1.1 billion. There's various parts of the geography that move around, but I wouldn't overread too much into it, it going up by $100 million. It's in that range of accuracy. But we still feel pretty good about the pipeline for DoD. Only about 25% of that pipeline is on modernization. The rest is what we see happening in the Air Force, Marine Corps, SOCOM, all of which is standardized on Falcon III, other Army spares and some other things. So on the DoD side, I would characterize it as remaining pretty solid for us. On the international side, it did come up by a couple of hundred million dollars, and it wasn't weighting. It was very specific opportunities that just have grown in value since we spoke about 3 months ago, and they're very specific ones. It's the shape or the contour of that $2.4 billion pipeline hasn't moved a lot. It's still more than half Middle East and Asia, where we know security's an issue. In the U.S., it's starting to pull back. Iraq is an important market for us, and that's pretty strong. Country in Africa. Obviously, Pakistan has been big, and I mentioned that in the script, and that's guiding -- getting a little bit more solid. A lot of it is -- about 15% of the pipeline is coalition countries that are deploying wideband, and interestingly enough, they're standardizing on our product, moving from 117Fs to 117Gs, and the balance is in Latin America. So it's in various pieces, but the growth is specific opportunities in some of those markets that I just mentioned. Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And then, just over on the margins. They were pretty strong and tactical kind of looks like a little lower, obviously, than unusual Q4 number, but higher than they were in the first part of last year. Is -- you mentioned on the last call, I believe, that you're looking for mix to be a little bit of a headwind for you as you get to the close of the year. Is that still true? Or are you feeling a little better about the sustainability of the margins here? William M. Brown: No, that is still true. And it's -- my comments there are very consistent with what we talked about last time. We did end the year, fiscal '13, very strong. We had unusually strong international margins based on the mix of what was in international. We did say, over the course of fiscal '14, as we see more international business and more systems business, that we'll see margins trending down over the course of the year. So we're not terribly surprised that we came in a little bit higher in Q1. It feels good. Dana and his team are performing exceptionally well on managing the various mix shifts and driving innovation, driving operational excellence. I think they're executing extremely, extremely well. We still see the full year coming at around 30%. We continued to invest in our business, and I made a specific -- maybe long-winded discussion around our R&D investment over the course of my prepared remarks to really drive home the point that as we do take out cost, we're investing, and we're investing quite a bit in that very, very important franchise we have in Tactical Communications. So we're investing in sales and marketing, in R&D, and we feel good about our ability to continue to take out cost and drive operational excellence in that segment, which remains really, really strong. So we're still at about 30% for the year and we think we've got a pretty good roadmap to achieve that, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Loomis of Stifel. William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Just looking at the shutdown impact and the sequestration. Ironically, you're talking about your shorter cycle businesses. IT Services had great awards and good performance. And in Tactical, your DoD pipeline looks better and awards have been good there. Can you just talk about how you've seen the shutdown, how that impacted your business going into the December quarter? And then just some thoughts as we're past -- we're already obviously in the fiscal '13 sequestration, '14 coming up. Any new thoughts there on how it could impact some of your shorter cycle U.S. federal business? William M. Brown: Sure. Yes, we saw a little bit disruption in the early part of October in some of our factories, mainly with the DCMA inspectors, when they were on furlough, they came back. Shortly thereafter it, very quickly, we got back in the business. So we didn't see much of a disruption on the product side based on the fact that the DCMA inspectors came back relatively quickly. In some of our IT business, we did see a couple of programs where the pencil is down for a couple of weeks. It was temporary. It was in the tens of people. Small, small numbers. So not a lot of big impact in our quarter. The bigger impact is that we see, and I think others have seen, is just the push out in awards. And that's going to take some time for the government to catch up with that. So overall, that's -- the impact is more push out on awards and less on sort of what would happen day-to-day in the early part of October. In terms of the shutdown and what's happening in DC, the shutdown is over, but here we are again, operating under a continuing resolution. And that's going to go on through mid-January when, obviously, sequestration could, in fact, get triggered again depending upon what happens. And the budget committee, I understand they're starting to meet this week and who's to say what's have going to happen over the 6 weeks. Will they create a budget? Will they do something that's different than what we're all expecting? We don't know. There's a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace. So for now, we're maintaining a pretty cautious view of where we are at on first half of the year, just as we previously expressed. We're not going to get into calling where we at in the first half versus second half. But we did say we'd be a bit more cautious in the first half, and I think that was an important point and it's playing out as we had thought just a couple of months ago. I think we had a good start in Q1. And we saw some encouraging news. We're focused on the actions that drive performance and generate solid free cash in the year. But as I said, there's still quite a bit of uncertainty, and we're managing through it just as best as we can. William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just one more in NMCI. Is -- what revenue run rate are you carrying to the year-end? If you could talk about that? And when -- how quickly do you think it will drop off? William M. Brown: On NMCI, it comes in at relatively strong margins, and they're not going to be too terribly different than what we've seen in the past. They're quite a bit above the normal segment margins that we seen in IT Services. I don't think I would want to speculate as to what they happen to be, but that, Bill, does give us, I'd say, a little bit more upside on the IT Services side of INS. And that will offset probably a little bit more pressure in some other parts of INS segment, which is why I was sort of couching my remarks on the 8% to 10% for the year. William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Is it running at the full rate going into the end of the year? William M. Brown: I would say it has been running very, very strong, and we don't see that it's going to change much for the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division : Guys, I just want to ask you a couple more questions about the FMS radio contract that had the ceiling increase a few weeks ago. I was just wondering, was that increase kind of in line with what you expected? And then maybe if you could share kind of how much value was left on that contract? And just kind of if that contract vehicle carries kind of the majority of your international orders? William M. Brown: Well, we did expect that those ceiling increases would come. Obviously, we watch, as we draw down some of the existing ceilings and watched carefully as to how much is remaining, we weren't surprised that the increases happened. We can't really get into specifics as to how much is left or where the numbers happen to be. But when you take a $500 million increase a few quarters ago, another $850 million recently, that's some pretty healthy headroom in those 2 contracts just based on the increase that we have seen. So I think that's -- I'm not sure, there was another part to your question, Pete. Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division : Yes, if that contract vehicle, is that kind of the majority of your international RF orders flow to that contract vehicle? William M. Brown: No, no. We've got other things that we do. There's some that go direct. There's some other vehicles. So no, that represents some parts of our international business, but not all of it. Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division : Okay, got it. And just one follow-up. On the $1 billion authorization, I forget how long that lasts for, but are you still expecting to do -- I think it was $200 million in repurchases this year? And I guess, what's the rationale for maybe not doing more, given the size of the authorization? Gary L. McArthur: Yes, Pete, this is Gary. There is no limitation on the time as to the $1 billion authorization. And looking at our capital deployment, at this point, we haven't changed our outlook for the year. We're going to maintain a dividend payout ratio again of at 30% or above. And we're targeting that $200 million in share buyback. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Could you help us figure out when the SRW applique, the manpack production awards may actually be awarded? What's your expectation on timing? William M. Brown: Those, both the manpack and Rifleman, have been shifting to the right. Our expectation today, based on what we're hearing, is that the RFP on the Rifleman should come out around the Christmas time. And we think the manpack will follow 45 to 60 days after that possibly. But again, there's a lot of moving parts. And I think the shutdown and the budget debates, I think -- and I think part of it is the rethinking positively for Harris Corporation going from single vendor to multi-vendor is also causing a little bit of a shift in the timing. But that's when we think RFP is going to come out. The award time has not changed from the -- what we're hearing from the DoD, sometime in the summer of next year. But again, as you move the front end, it could move the back end a little bit. My understanding is they want some delivery orders prior to 15.1, so we think that is still the timing that they're shooting for. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : And what about the SRW applique in terms of funded orders? William M. Brown: Yes, the applique is, we think, the award is going to come out sometime at the end of the year, around December. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Quilty of Raymond James. Chris Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a follow-up on orders. Can you remind us when does the protest period end for the MNVR contract? And have you seen a protest yet? William M. Brown: We understand, Chris, that the time for the -- a timely protest on MNVR expired yesterday. So we have the debriefings that happened, and we have heard nothing. So we are under the impression that there will be no protest. Chris Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Congratulations. A follow-up question on the CapRock business. Congratulations on that Carnival win with -- that with the Royal Caribbean, I think, is about 60%, if you can confirm that, of the cruise industry? And can you speak specifically about what factors led to those wins given the fact that MTN had been the incumbent, I think, for the better part of a decade. Was it something specific in the technology implementation, or pricing, or bundling of other services that you think contributed to those wins? William M. Brown: I think there would -- I wouldn't want to try to generalize it to any specific factor because they're very big, complicated awards. And the decision factor by the Royal Caribbean was probably a little bit different than Carnival. When you have thousands of people on your boats, and you have 100 boats in your fleet, and cruises going every year -- every week, rather. And the importance of people bringing devices on the boat is very, very important for the cruise line to pick a very reliable communications partner to handle interactions with their customers and their crew. And I think you were very, very thoughtful on this. This RFP went off for some time. It was price competitive. But they were looking for a solution. They were looking for reliability. They were looking for the ability to bring other communications technologies, not just VSAT, do things differently on the boat. So I think the variety of expertise that Harris Corporation has in the space, plus the financial backing of the corporation and the sort of wherewithal of our entity, I think, was some of the factors that went behind Carnival choosing us. But we feel very good about the award. We feel very good about where we're at with Royal Caribbean, and we see there's more opportunities in the space. In terms of the share, I think you can -- I'm not really sure exactly what the share is. You have 100 boats for Carnival and another 35, 34-ish for Royal Caribbean. So I think you can run the math from that. We're not going to be 60% of this segment at this point, I don't think. Chris Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And to what degree are you going to be able to generate operating leverage from the fixed amount of transponders that you're already leasing? Or would something like Caribbean require a large new incremental purchase of transponder capacity? Gary L. McArthur: I don't believe so, Chris. We basically have our global teleports established, and then we have good coverage in that region that their ships would be sailing. So it's not really on the transponder side. With regards to the bandwidth, we definitely have gone out and contracted for the bandwidth. So we're pretty sure that we're going to be able to do those at competitive rates. So we're pretty well-positioned and should be able to leverage the infrastructure that's already in place. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of Sterne Agee. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : On the Government Communications side, can you talk about the balance between the cost initiatives you've obviously done successful with versus new business and competing for new contracts? And are you [ph] using the operating leverage for growth? You've given this focus on cost going forward. Are you more comfortable enough in your position to just continue in more of a harvesting mode at this point? William M. Brown: We're definitely not in a harvesting mode in GCS. In fact, when I talked a lot about investments in company-funded R&D in Tactical Communications, but we're substantially raising our company-funded R&D within the GCS segment as well. Geared towards, in many ways, a lot of the products that we sell, it's been very successful. We talked about this in an investor meeting 1.5 years ago or so. And we've seen the amount of product business we do at GCS come up. It keeps getting a little bit better. We see opportunities to extend some of that product business around the world into international markets. And we're investing to capture some of that. So it's not harvest. It's actually continuing to grow. I think Sheldon and his team have done an outstanding job in managing their programs and executing on the programs to continue to keep margins on an upward trajectory. And I think there's not much more to say about that. I think they've just done an outstanding job in that segment. Even in the first quarter, while the revenues were -- came in a little bit lighter than maybe people would've expected and sort of what we're guiding to for the year, even the revenue performance, I think, in the first quarter was pretty good. It -- outside of a pretty tough compare, which is really the first quarter only on GOES-R. Outside of that, the revenue would've been about flat. So they're off to a good start in the year as well on the top line, and as we talked before, pretty good on the margins as well. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : That's good to hear. And then can you just update us on the healthcare platform roll out? I might have missed this. I came on a little late, just curious. William M. Brown: Yes, we're a little bit late in the release of a critical piece of software for the commercial health care market. We thought it would happen earlier in Q1. But it is launched. It's live in a couple of environments. It hasn't been very long, so the feedback is still very nascent, but no surprises. We keep a watch eye on it. We hope that that's going to be successful. We expect that that's going to be successful, and we'll see better performance at the back end of the year on the commercial side. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : And is there any way to kind of size that opportunity maybe longer term? William M. Brown: Well, it's -- look, the healthcare process is a relatively small piece of our portfolio. The business is $200 million and the commercial side is $50 million or less. So it's -- right now, it's small. We're focused on getting the software deployment right, getting it working right in the space. And then once we do that, we'll see the effect it has on the portfolio for time. It's just too soon to say. Right now, it's really not a big part of Harris Corporation. Pamela Padgett : Operator, is there anyone else in the queue? Josh, do you have another question? Operator : There are no more questions in the queue. Pamela Padgett : Okay. I think we'll wrap up the call, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Operator : Thank you very much for joining today's conference, ladies and gentlemen. This now concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a very good day.",

Josh Sullivan \u2013 Sterne Agee Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Co. Operator :  Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Harris Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter 2014 Earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will follow at that time. If you require any assistance during the call, please press star then zero on your touchtone telephone. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. I\u2019m Pamela Padgett, and on the call today is Bill Brown, President and CEO, and Gary McArthur, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press release and on this teleconference and the related presentation, we\u2019ll discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures are included in the tables of our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of the call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn the call to you. William Brown : Okay, well thank you, Pam, and good morning everyone. Second quarter results were solid with earnings per share and orders above prior year. Our focus on cost savings continues to drive good performance in a tough U.S. government market, and international orders and revenue were both particularly strong, highlighting significant progress in our strategy to expand outside the U.S. Turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation, earnings per share was $1.27, up 2% on revenue down 5%. Good program execution as well as company-wide operational excellence initiatives, including the benefit of prior year restructuring actions, drove operating margin for the company 50 basis points higher year-over-year and up in each segment. Orders were up 8%, driven in large part by a 35% increase in tactical communications on strength in the international market. Orders were also higher in CapRock\u2019s energy and maritime markets as well as in IT services. Book-to-bill was 1.20 for the company and we ended the quarter with funded backlog of $3.4 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially. As we mentioned in the call last time, our international tactical radio pipeline was firming up and in the quarter we booked a number of significant international orders across a broad customer base, including $100 million from Australia, $49 million from a country in the Middle East, $36 million and $21 million from two NATO countries, and $28 million from a country in Latin America, all of which are multi-year programs and carry additional follow-on opportunities both within the 12- to 18-month pipeline and beyond. Now typically once we become a tactical radio supplier of choice in a country, additional follow-on opportunities tend to flow to Harris. Australia is a great example. Our relationship with Australia goes back decades and orders to date have now exceeded half a billion dollars, including the recent $100 million order for Phase III of their modernization program, and we still see significant opportunity ahead of us. Even after strong bookings in the quarter, our international tactical pipeline remains robust at $2.2 billion with other significant opportunities that we\u2019ve discussed before, such as Iraq and two countries in central Asia, making good progress through the procurement process and moving closer to award. On the U.S. DoD side, tactical radio revenue was weaker in the quarter as expected due to budget constraints and as customers operated under a CR; but we also had some good news with the U.S. Army officially changing its procurement strategy for the JTRS, Manpack and Rifleman radio programs to full and open competition and a multi-vendor award. The Army\u2019s tactical radio modernization remains a tremendous multi-billion dollar opportunity for Harris, and we\u2019re also encouraged that the Army\u2019s plans are well funded in the budget. We believe our unique commercial model, which drives speed and innovation, and the scale advantage provided by our extensive international presence will continue to make us highly competitive in all the Army\u2019s procurements. In our INS segment, as mentioned in our last call, we\u2019ve booked a five-year contract with Carnival for broadband data and communications services across their fleet of 103 ships. This is a big win and, following closely on the heels of an earlier win with Royal Caribbean, gives us more than a third of the global passenger cruise market. As we\u2019ve seen with Royal Caribbean, the unprecedented bandwidth we\u2019re delivering to a cruise ship is causing cruise operators to rethink the services they can provide to improve passenger experience and crew morale, driving bandwidth demand far higher than anticipated in the base contract. This is a real positive development for our growing cruise business. Now before turning it over to Gary to discuss segment financial results, let me make a few comments on the recent budget deal. First of all, it mitigates the sequester burden and is a good first step towards more certainty in the government market. At the funding line level, we saw no big surprises. Our major programs within government communications are well supported, including all three FAA programs \u2013 FTI, next-gen data comm, and next-gen voice switching, our classified programs, as well as GOES-R, F35, and F18.  In tactical radios, the typical visible spending lines are about what we had expected. The MMVR and HMS budgets were well funded at a level to support upcoming procurements. There was no cut to SOCOM, and the Navy, the Marine Corps and Air Force took a little haircut from the President\u2019s budget request but were in line with what we had planned. Foreign military funding is up about 3% overall versus the prior year, and at the country level our international FMF opportunities are well supported. Of course, we need to see how the funding flows down to individual programs, but overall from what we\u2019ve seen so far, these are positive signs. So as we look ahead, we have a little more budget certainty, more traction in international markets, and we continue to ramp up our operational excellence initiatives to reduce cost while funding investment in R&D and sales and marketing, all of which have increased our confidence and led to us raising our fiscal \u201914 earnings guidance.  And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary to comment on segment results and guidance for 2014. Gary? Gary McArthur : Thank you Bill and good morning everyone. Moving to segment results on Slide 5, RF communication orders were $512 million compared to $402 million in the prior year and up 27%. Revenue was up $455 million, down 6% from prior year of $486 million. Book-to-bill was 1.13.  In tactical communications, orders were $387 million, up 35% while revenue was $320 million, declining 5%. Both orders and revenue in the U.S. were weak, as anticipated, while international revenue and orders were strong. Book-to-bill for tactical was 1.21 and funded backlog increased sequentially from first quarter\u2019s $664 million to $730 million. Compared to this time last year, backlog is up 30% and trending positive. Public safety revenue in the quarter was $135 million, declining 9% due to continued weakness across system and terminal sales in the state and local markets. Public safety orders were $125 million, up 8%, and while orders have picked up and are up 10% in the first half, they will not turn into revenue fast enough to drive revenue growth in the year, and we now expect revenue to decline mid to high single digits for the full fiscal year. The weakness is at last partially due to the market, which was up 8% in calendar \u201912 when our revenue grew 12%. It was about flat in calendar \u201913 with our revenue falling 7%. We\u2019ve responded by adding resources to drive growth, including investing in sales, marketing, and new product development, and we expect top line recovery to begin next fiscal year.  Operating income for the RF communications segments was $142 million with a 31.3% operating margin in the quarter compared to prior year\u2019s 31.1%. For the full year in RF communications, we still expect flat revenue; however, we now expect tactical communications revenue will be up low single digits, driven by stronger international growth offset by revenue decline in public safety, and we still expect an operating margin of about 30% for the year. Turning now to Slide 6 and integrated network solutions, second quarter segment revenue decreased 9% to $366 million. Revenue growth in CapRocks energy and maritime markets and flat revenue in IT services was more than offset by lower government revenue in both CapRock and healthcare. The government market for both of these businesses has been more challenging than expected, with tighter funding and increased competition.  Segment orders were up year-over-year and were higher than revenue due to IT services and in CapRock\u2019s energy and maritime markets. CapRock also received a $75 million follow-on order from DISA to provide end-to-end managed terrestrial network services. IT services orders included $61 million from the U.S. Navy to extend continuity of services on the Navy Marine Corps intranet program through the end of our fiscal year, and a $53 million follow-on order to operate and support the U.S. Air Force Space Command\u2019s 50th Space Wing. IT services also was awarded a position on the six-year multi-vendor NETCENTS-2 Product IDIQ contract from the U.S. Air Force with a $9 billion ceiling value. Integrated network solutions segment operating income was $33 million, flat compared with the prior year. Operating margin was 8.9% and improved compared to 8.2% in the prior year as cost savings initiatives offset the impact of lower revenue and margin pressure from a very competitive government market environment.  Looking ahead to the full fiscal year for the segment, we now expect the strength in CapRock\u2019s commercial business, which is trending towards double-digit growth, will be more than offset by a weaker than expected government market in CapRock and healthcare and a slower revenue ramp in commercial healthcare. Revenue for the segment is now expected to be down 5 to 6% and operating margin to be in the range of 8 to 9%. Moving to Slide 7, revenue in government communications was $433 million, increasing 1% from the prior year and higher in all three customer areas \u2013 civil, classified, and for the first time in nine quarters, defense. Major drivers included higher revenue from classified and space customers, the ramp-up of FAA\u2019s next-gen data comm program, and the start of full-rate production on the Army\u2019s MET sat comm terminal program, all of which was partially offset by lower revenue from NOAA\u2019s GOES-R weather program. In the quarter, Harris received orders of $46 million from the FAA for the next-gen data comm program and $31 million for avionics infrastructure for the F35 program, as well as awards totaling $121 million from classified customers. Operating income was $66 million and operating margin was strong at 15.4% as a result of good program performance. For the year, we now expect government communications revenue to be stronger than previously anticipated and have increased guidance from a range of down 5 to 7% to now down 1 to 3%. We also expect a stronger operating margin closer to 15%.  Turning to Slide 8, free cash flow was $55 million versus $120 million last year, and capital expenditures were $52 million compared to $39 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by a billing rate dispute with the U.S. government, which is close to being resolved, and tactical orders booking late in the quarter. We continue to expect free cash flow to be equal to or higher than net income. During the quarter, we repurchased about 787,000 shares for a total cash outlay of $50 million, bringing first half repurchases to $150 million. We now expect full-year repurchases of $300 million versus prior guidance of $200 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6%, and we still expect about 33% for the full fiscal year.  Moving to Slide 9, 2014 EPS guidance has been increased from a range of $4.65 to $4.85 to a range of $4.80 to $4.90. Revenue guidance remains unchanged with an expected decline of 1 to 3%. With that, let me turn it back to you, Bill. William Brown : Okay, well thank you, Gary. On these calls, I try to report the good with the bad, and this quarter is no exception. Overall, we had a balanced quarter with solid earnings, encouraging orders, and increasing backlog, with a number of positives including international strength, stronger revenue in government communications, IT services performing well in a touch market, and commercial CapRock gaining momentum. But as Gary pointed out, there are pressure areas as well : performance in public safety, healthcare not maturing quickly enough, and a more challenging CapRock government market. I can assure you that all of these areas are getting a lot of attention from senior management. I know we have a lot of work to do and we\u2019re going to say focused on it until we can demonstrate sustainably better results. So with that, I\u2019d like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: Hey, good morning all. Just a couple of quick ones. On PSPC weakness, I wonder if you might just give us a little more color and help understand what\u2019s going on there. You mentioned timing of contracts, but then also mentioned investments in new products. I wonder is this more of a tighter competitive environment or is it more of a timing related, end market customer sort of effect? Anything you can do to help us understand that better? William Brown : Yeah, Carter. I think it\u2019s a combination of both things. As Gary mentioned, we do see it\u2019s partly the market. The market was pretty strong in CY12 \u2013 calendar \u201912 \u2013 and we were up above the market, so we gained a bit of share. That reversed itself in calendar \u201913 when the market was more flattish and we were down 7, including down about 11 in our first half of our fiscal year. So part of it is the market. As I said on this call last number of quarters, about eight of our last 10 quarters, we had book-to-bill less than 1, and although we saw orders grow year-over-year in the first half \u2013 in fact, up about 12% in Q1, 7-ish in Q2 \u2013 it\u2019s mostly in our programs business, and that adds to backlog, which is positive for us, but the revenue impact from that is likely to move out of our fiscal year and into fiscal \u201915. As I said last time, I think we\u2019re really doing all the right things to grow our business. We are investing in sales and marketing. We\u2019re adding sales people to drive our terminals business to capture large systems, to work to convert some of the old analog systems to P25, including our own EDAC system. So we\u2019re adding sales and marketing resources, and that does take time to return. We\u2019re also investing in new product development to add features, to expand our offering, and to reduce the cost of our product offering. Again, that also is adding cost and will pay back, we believe, over time. I think as I step back, I think the backlog remains pretty solid. It\u2019s about $600 million, which is pretty much in line with where we were in fiscal \u201913 sales, so at least going backwards it\u2019s about all of our \u201913 sales in backlog today. The opportunity pipeline is pretty good, it\u2019s pretty healthy. We do think the market is going to return to its historic growth rate of 3 to 5% range over time, and we think with the investments that we\u2019re making and the organizational model we\u2019re putting into place, we think this could be a nice growth business for us. Those are all the effects that are happening right now; we just don\u2019t see it returning in the back half of our fiscal year. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: Okay, great. And with respect to the RF guidance, obviously you would assume that was a positive mix benefit with the tactical versus PSPC shift in the revenues, but the margin guidance didn\u2019t change. Is that it just wasn\u2019t material enough to change it, or is there anything we\u2019re missing there? William Brown : No, that would naturally drive you to that conclusion. We so see some mix shifts in the back half. We saw big international orders in the quarter which will turn into revenue in the back half, and the international business, especially with the systems and the product mix that we\u2019re seeing there, comes in at slightly lower margins than we have typically seen in the past. But I think the bigger factor is that in December, an official Army notification came out that opened up to full competition and multi-vendor the HMS program, and we purposely held back investment on that until that officially came out. We now will step up substantially in the back half on R&D investment. We\u2019re in that business and we think we\u2019re going to be very, very competitive, and we\u2019re going to invest to be competitive. So I think it\u2019s more of a factor of the investment we see coming in the back half in IRAD. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: That\u2019s great. Thanks. I\u2019ll let somebody else ask. William Brown : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. You may begin. Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Great, thank you. A question about INS \u2013 the reduction in revenue outlook there was fairly dramatic, I guess fortunately offset by government communications. Can you step through the elements of that reduction for the year? Gary McArthur : Sure Yair, let me touch on that. What we\u2019re really seeing is further weakness in the government areas of CapRock and in healthcare being more severe than expected. As we talked about in my remarks, competitive pressures are higher than we thought they would be. I think the government reduction in spending in these areas has only increased that. Now, we\u2019ve taken steps that we think will make us more cost competitive in the back half, but we do see that that part of the business is going to more than offset what we expect to have as double-digit growth in the CapRock, energy and maritime businesses, and hits doing a little bit better than the 10% down we said in the first half. We think it will be now kind of low single digits down in the second half, is why we came up with the guidance that we just provided. Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Great. And then just one more \u2013 your headquarters expenses stepped down nicely in the quarter, and I just wanted to know whether the rate that we saw in 2Q is the right way to look at things going forward or whether there was anything that kept the expenses unusually low in 2Q. William Brown : We see quarter to quarter some variations, and if you go back a number of quarters, you\u2019ll see some things moving around. But Yair, the long-term trend has been to bring down our corporate headquarter expenses starting a couple of years ago, based on where the market happens to be, so it\u2019s part of a trend but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the quarter-to-quarter gyration. Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: So for the full year, something in the low 60\u2019s is still the way to think about it? William Brown : Yeah, that\u2019s probably in the right ballpark. Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Loomis of Stifel. You may begin. Bill Loomis \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Hi, thank you. Just staying with INS, a couple more questions on that. On your commentary, you said CapRock commercial was trending towards double-digit. Was it double-digit growth in the quarter, and it sounds like you certainly expect it in the second half, so what type of growth for the year are we seeing on CapRock commercial? William Brown : Well, very strong orders in the first half on the commercial side. The revenue will follow that, so the revenue\u2019s positive growth wasn\u2019t double digit in the first half but we do see it getting a bit stronger in the back half of the year on CapRock commercial. Bill Loomis \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : And then on the commercial healthcare, what\u2019s the update now on Carefx and how do you see that, and even more importantly on the margin side, how has that been impacting margins? How has it factored in in the second half? William Brown : You know, Bill, on the healthcare business, about 70% of our business in healthcare is with the U.S. government, and I think we mentioned last time we lost a lot of re-competes at the VA where the market has shifted from development to sustainment that requires a lower cost structure. We\u2019ve leveraging what we have on our hits business, which was a very low cost structure, low RAP rate to improve our competitiveness on the government side, but I don\u2019t see that coming back in here. So that\u2019s on the government side of healthcare. On the commercial side, it\u2019s about 30% of a relatively small healthcare business is commercial, so read into that about $30 million to $40 million in revenue. We are seeing a slower ramp of our clinical integration software. We are installing it in four different customers in North America. We have a pilot going on in the U.K. with a partner in British Telecom. It\u2019s not a shrink wrap-type installation. It requires several months to connect all the departments, the clinics, the hospitals in the network. We are at the beginning stages of the roll-out. It\u2019s too early to call success, but keep in mind it\u2019s a relatively small part of the overall company. On the margin side if you go back, and I\u2019ll talk about really healthcare overall because that\u2019s the broader entity, we had a pretty big loss in fiscal \u201912. It was in the $18 million range. We reduced it last year to about $7 million. We\u2019ve seen some contract losses again this year in the VA. The spend for software development on the commercial side, which has moved towards expense from being capitalized, is also causing us some losses in the fiscal \u201914 area, and it\u2019s undermining our progress. We lost about $8 million in the first half of the year in healthcare as a whole. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter which we think will improve our second half results, but clearly we need to see a customer ramp-up and higher revenues to drive us to being profitable in the healthcare business. Bill Loomis \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nada with JP Morgan. You may begin. Joe Nadal \u2013 JP Morgan : Good morning. Bill, you highlighted several times the international strength in RF, and I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share what percentage of your tactical communication revenue this year, you think now will be international, or maybe percentage of the backlog or some such metric. William Brown : I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get into the backlog, but I think we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve seen a trend moving from international being less than DoD in the past, especially when we had the pretty big ramp-up in fiscal \u201910, \u201911, to now international is higher than DoD. And I know Pam is going to cringe, but it\u2019s probably in a 60/40 range, international to DoD this year on a revenue basis. Joe Nadal \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then could you provide your\u2014you gave us your pipeline for international. Could you give us that for domestic and then also for public safety? William Brown : I\u2019ll ask maybe Gary on the public safety side. On the DoD side, our pipeline, 12- to 18-month pipeline is now about $900 million. You may recall we had $1.1 billion in the last call. About $250 million of the 900 is in pretty advanced stages of closure \u2013 it\u2019s in proposal and closure phases. Mostly supported by fiscal \u201913 and \u201914 funding lines plus what we\u2019ve always said some not-so-visible lines, about 55% of that backlog of\u2014or that pipeline, rather, of $900 million is Air Force, is the Marine Corps, it\u2019s SOCOM. It\u2019s all the modernization activities there, all of which are standardizing on the Falcon 3. About 10% of our pipeline is Army BCT modernization. Last time, that was 25%, so about $250 million or so. Today, it\u2019s 10% of the 900, so we\u2019ve backed out based on what we\u2019re seeing in those big HMS programs from our pipeline, because that\u2019s moving out to the right. And the other 10%-ish is Army, there\u2019s 10% of so that\u2019s spares and services, a few other percentages that are more in specialized-type products \u2013 ISR, tablets and other things. But it\u2019s $900 million today for DoD. Joe Nadal \u2013 JP Morgan : And then just on the public safety side? Gary McArthur : On the public safety side, Joe, the pipeline is pretty healthy at $2.4 billion, and looking at the make-up of the pipeline, there\u2019s a lot of different opportunities across the board in the state and local. It really isn\u2019t the pipeline that\u2019s the issues; it\u2019s projects moving to the right and our win rate isn\u2019t where it needs to be, is the key area we\u2019ve got to improve on. Joe Nadal \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, and then just one more quick one. Bill, you upped your share purchase guidance for the year by 100 million. How are you thinking, a little more broadly speaking looking forward, not just for this year but into next year, about cash deployment \u2013 you know, dividend, repurchase, and any M&A? William Brown : Well, we look at this on a long-term basis, and nothing that we see today, no current event is changing our strategy on capital deployment. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders in a small, efficient way, and if you remember and go back the last three years, we\u2019ve returned in the form of share repurchases and dividends about 90% of our free cash flow. We continue to target a dividend payout ratio of about 30%. As Gary mentioned, we now expect about $300 million in our share buyback. Joe, you remember going back a couple of years, we really have focused on free cash flow. It\u2019s now become part of our executive incentive compensation metrics. We\u2019re confident about achieving our full-year target of about 100% of net income, and we are fully funding all of our internal needs. We don\u2019t see any significant M&A on the near-term horizon. We have no debt that\u2019s due until the 2017 time period. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with $300 million or so of cash on our books, which we typically carry towards the end of the year. And as you run all that math, it leaves us with some excess cash, some of which we\u2019ve now chosen to return to shareholders in a step-up in our buyback in the second half. So that philosophy, that approach, that focus on free cash generation, I don\u2019t expect is going to change going forward any time soon. Joe Nadal \u2013 JP Morgan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, good morning everyone. I wondered if you could go back to the announcement of jitter\u2019s HMS moving to multi-vendor. Is there anything you can share with us from a timeline perspective in terms of what you may expect or what we can look for on milestones along the way with the competition and eventual rewards? William Brown : Yeah, Noah, there was an industry day back in December, and there was some light shed on how the program is now expected to roll out. Overall, we\u2019re seeing about a six to seven-month delay from what we had previously communicated. It\u2019s primarily due to the change in acquisition strategy, which we view as a positive. We now see for the Rifleman radio program above HMS, we see the RFP coming out probably in the next month or so \u2013 we heard January, February of \u201914, so in the next month, with an award probably the end of this calendar year. It says in the documents Q1 fiscal \u201915, so I\u2019d read into that December of this year with first shipments starting in March of \u201915. For the Manpack, we expect the RFP to come out sometime around April of this year, so a couple months later. The award in Q2 of fiscal \u201915, so again I read into that about March of calendar \u201915 with a shipment that\u2019s starting around April of 2015, all of which are in support of the NIE of 16.1 and the fielding for capabilities at 16.  So when you look at the numbers and where the movement is, we did pull this out of our 12- to 18-month pipeline, as I mentioned to Joe\u2019s question. It then results in relatively limited sales for us at Harris Corporation in fiscal \u201915, more of a ramp in that business more starting in fiscal \u201916. Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Bill, I also wanted to ask you with the momentum you seem to be experiencing internationally, I\u2019m curious is there something that\u2019s changed in the last three to six months about the total broader U.S. contractor selling internationally process, or is this more Harris company-specific stepping up the effort there? William Brown : I guess\u2014you know, I do see a lot of our peer companies stepping up their efforts to sell internationally, and you hear that in a lot of the calls. I think for Harris, international has been a big focus for us over many, many years, and we have an extremely well established dealer base, especially on the tactical side, and we saw international revenue step back while the DoD was pushed pretty hard over the last five, six, seven years with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are pushing international very, very heavily and have been since I came a couple of years ago. We\u2019ve stepped up our focus. We\u2019re driving it very hard. We\u2019re putting resources in place. We recently announced the appointment of a new president of our Brazil operations and we\u2019re putting some resources there. We\u2019re pushing hard in the Middle East, we see good growth in Asia. So I think some of it is just what a lot of our peers are trying to do. I do think we have somewhat of an advantage because we have a very well established base and we\u2019re driving it very hard. So our numbers, if you go back to fiscal \u201910, our revenue coming from international sources as a percent of the total was around 10%. Last year it was around 26, and this year we expect it to be in the 29%-plus range. So I think overall, pretty good results. Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. Just one other quick one. The CAPEX number stepped up pretty noticeably in the quarter, which it doesn\u2019t usually do seasonally. What drove that, and what does that do in the back half? William Brown : Yeah, we\u2019ll see this year capital spending to be up over last year, and it\u2019s really just a couple of things. One is we\u2019ve got a building we\u2019re constructing for the GCS business in Palm Bay, a new engineering facility which was started a number of years ago, and we\u2019 expect to complete that by the end of this year or early calendar \u201915; and then a pretty big software investment upgrade at RF communications. So those are the two biggest events, and that will drive our capital spending up as a whole this year for Harris. Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Have you quantified that for the year? Gary McArthur : Yeah, I\u2019d say year-over-year it will be up about $70 million just in those two areas - $50 million up this year in the building and about $20 million higher year-over-year for the software. And total CAPEX, I think we report in the Q and we\u2019re expecting around $250 million for capital expenditures this year. Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. You may begin. Gautam Khanna \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Hey, thanks. I was hoping you could comment on the $2.2 billion foreign pipeline and maybe just articulate how that looks over the next six months versus over the balance of that 12- to 18-month period. William Brown : That\u2019s a good question, Gautam, and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll get at the next six months. I think that\u2019s cutting that a little bit tighter than we\u2019d want, but I\u2019m happy to comment on the shape of the pipeline and then you can read in what you wish. But as we mentioned, it\u2019s about $2.2 billion. It\u2019s about the same as the first quarter, and we have about $600 million that are in the proposal and closure phase, so I guess you could read that that is more near-term than the balance of the pipeline. It is very healthy. It continues to firm \u2013 we feel pretty good about that. As I said last time, more than half of it comes out of the Middle East and Asia. We know that Iraq is a big part of our pipeline. There\u2019s a country in Africa. We see several other countries in the Middle East, a couple countries in central Asia. All are in that category that gives us confidence that more than half of it is coming from the Middle East and Asia. We see about 15% or so coming from coalition countries that are deploying wide-band, and you see that as some of the big order that came in Q2. In Australia, we see more opportunities over the next 12 to 18 months, and we see Latin America firming up \u2013 that\u2019s about 15 to 20% of our pipeline. Brazil looks pretty good, Mexico looks pretty good, Colombia, a few other countries there are in that pipeline. And the rest would be just a group of smaller countries sprinkled in there. So that sort of gives us some characterization of our overall pipeline. I wouldn\u2019t comment more than that on what the next six months may look like. Gautam Khanna \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Fair enough. Within the Middle Eastern piece, which it seems like you have a concentration, are there any that stand out as particularly large awards, and if you could just give us a sense for the size of those. I mean, Iraq you\u2019ve mentioned in the past, but\u2014 William Brown : Yeah, what we\u2019ve talked about is\u2014I mean, Saudi\u2019s got a pretty big long-term pipeline. Certainly Iraq is pretty sizeable. UAE is a good opportunity for us. I think those are the more significant ones, but there are opportunities going forward in, we believe, Oman and Yemen and Jordan and other places. But I think those are the biggest ones. Gautam Khanna \u2013 Cowen & Co.: And then if you could just comment\u2014I mean, on the HMS multi-vendor, how do you expect to\u2014how are you going to manage margins in that environment, because presumably with multi-vendor, you\u2019re going to have persistent price competition on the incremental orders. So if you could just walk through what you expect pricing to do over the next several years and how you expect to manage the margins, thanks. William Brown : Well Gautam, it\u2019s a very good question and I know it\u2019s on the minds of many people. The RFPs aren\u2019t out yet, so it\u2019s tough to comment on what the pricing is going to be or pricing trends, but I would say relative to that particular program \u2013 and I alluded to this in my prepared remarks \u2013 we\u2019ve got enormous scale in this business with a very, very large international tactical radio business that\u2019s manufactured along the same lines that we manufacture our DoD business in one facility in Rochester, New York, so that gives us very big scale advantages and I think that could be brought to bear to be very price competitive, where we need to be from a pricing perspective, and yet still maintain strong margins in that business. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily over time going to be just simply a price shoot-out on task orders because we will continue to invest, as we always do, in driving innovation, and we will always invest to put more technology into the product to differentiate our solution and hopefully that will end up allowing us to preserve pricing and preserve margin in the business. So that\u2019s our expectation, but you should expect that with the investment we\u2019re making in R&D in the back half stepping up from the front half, that we\u2019re committed to the business and we\u2019re going to invest to win. Gautam Khanna \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Maybe I\u2019ll just ask another one, then. You mentioned\u2014you know, in MMVR, you basically were the 100% share winner. On HMS, do you have a sense for where the government wants to go, whether they want to split it 50/50 or among three suppliers, or are they going to be comfortable awarding a large percentage of the requirement to one vendor? William Brown : Yeah, we really don\u2019t know, Gautam, at this point. In fact, we believe there\u2019s going to be multiple vendors \u2013 going to be at least two \u2013 and it depends on what the program of record does \u2013 is it going bidding as one or is it going to be bidding as two on the Manpack and the Rifleman? And it depends. So if they bid as two and us, that could be three awards. How the government decides to split it up is unknown to us. We\u2019re confident that there\u2019s a long-term, big opportunity based on the acquisition objective, which in the ADM that came out in December didn\u2019t\u2014it was reemphasizing the same sets of numbers that we\u2019ve seen in the past in terms of the Manpack. So we don\u2019t know how many bidders are going to be there, but we fully expect to be one and we fully expect to win our fair share of the awards going forward. Gautam Khanna \u2013 Cowen & Co.: Thanks a lot. Pamela Padgett : Operator, I think we have one more person in the queue. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Sullivan of Sterne Agee. You may begin. Josh Sullivan \u2013 Sterne Agee : Good morning. On the energy side of CapRock, has the success been (audio interference) the existing rigs or moving on to these new, larger, more sophisticated deepwater rigs? William Brown : You know, it\u2019s really both actually. We are winning more content on existing rigs, and we are finding ways of winning share in some of the new vessels that are being launched, so it\u2019s really both of them, Josh. Josh Sullivan \u2013 Sterne Agee : Okay. And just on the Carnival wins, what does the contract structure look like? Is it a big, upfront payment with a long tail in service? William Brown : You know, we\u2019re not going to get into the specific details of how the contract has been constructed. It is a five-year deal. We are precluded from talking about the amount of the deal, but similar to what we see elsewhere in CapRock, there is equipment installation up front but then there is recurring revenue that comes back over time. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll talk more about the contract structure than that. Josh Sullivan \u2013 Sterne Agee : Okay, thank you. Pamela Padgett : Operator, I think we have one more person in the queue. Operator : Our next question is from Rich Valera of Needham & Company. You may begin. Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Co.: Thank you, good morning. Bill, in light of your comments that you see the HMS program mainly contributing revenue in fiscal \u201916, anything to say on fiscal \u201915 expectations for the DoD tactical portion of the business in terms of growth? William Brown : Well, I think it\u2019s too soon to talk about fiscal \u201915. We just saw some of the line item detail in the appropriations on fiscal \u201914. We know that we have a top line number for DoD in fiscal \u201914. We\u2019re four to six weeks away, I believe, from a President\u2019s budget coming out that would give us, I think, a little more insight into his and the DoD\u2019s spending priorities on how much they will plan to spend on force structure versus investment accounts and modernization. And once we know that, we\u2019ll know more about that the shape of \u201915 looks like than we know today, so I wouldn\u2019t get out beyond talking about fiscal \u201914 at this point. We\u2019ll share with you as we learn more about that budget and it\u2019s implications for Harris going forward. Rich Valera \u2013 Needham & Co.: Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful, Bill. Pamela Padgett : All right, thank you everyone for joining us today. Appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Inc., Research Division Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela A. Padgett: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Call. I'm Pamela Padgett. And on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; and Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, on this teleconference and the related presentation, we may discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of this call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown: Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Third quarter results were solid with revenue and earnings per share above prior year, which was impacted by the triggering of sequestration. Government Communications Systems and international tactical radio within RF Communications had excellent revenue growth in the quarter, and both segments produced strong bottom line performance. Our strategy to lower costs while increasing R&D to drive growth and international expansion is serving us well in this constrained government budget environment and was evident in this quarter's results. Company-funded R&D was up 10% in the quarter and for the year is expected to be up high single digits similar to last year's 8% increase. Total international revenue for the year for the company was up 39% in the third quarter and up 15% year-to-date. And we're on track to increase international revenue for the company from 26% in fiscal '13 to around 29% this year. Turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation. Revenue was up 5%. Income from continuing operations was up 10%. And earnings per share was up 13% to $1.27. Earnings per share included a $0.02 net benefit from out-of-period adjustments, and Mick will describe the impact by segment. It's also worth noting that the prior year quarter benefited from a retroactive R&D tax credit of about $7 million.  Orders in the quarter were about $1.1 billion, and book-to-bill was 0.88. Year-to-date, book-to-bill remained above 1, and we ended the quarter with strong funded backlog of $3.3 billion, down a bit from the previous quarter's $3.4 billion but up 4% year-over-year. Strong international revenue growth drove revenues up 21% in Tactical Communications. International orders were up over the prior year and included 2 significant orders of $82 million and $49 million from countries in Asia that are part of larger opportunities. And we continue to make progress in the lengthy procurement process for what are significant, multiyear modernization opportunities in Iraq. Our international tactical pipeline is healthy, and it expanded a bit in the quarter to $2.3 billion from a previous $2.2 billion. The pipeline replenishing itself after the large orders we booked in our second and third quarters is encouraging as it points to continuing underlying market strength. It also reflects our strong competitive position and the investments we've made over the last several years in feet on the ground and new product development. And those investments are bearing fruit with the recent launch of 2 new products for the international market, the wideband HF radio and the multiband handheld radio, which achieved close to $100 million of revenue in the quarter. In the U.S. market, as expected, the Tactical business continues to be soft as a result of DoD budget pressures. Modernization is a significant opportunity. The services are committed and it's progressing, although slower than hoped. While constrained, the U.S. market is still substantial, and our 12- to 18-month opportunity pipeline remains stable at $1 billion, up a bit from $900 million last quarter. Recent news on the Army's multibillion dollar modernization effort has been mixed. As we've talked about before, the Army's decision to change their procurement strategy to open competition and multi-vendor awards is a positive development for Harris. But it has caused a lengthy process of revising RFPs to reflect the new acquisition strategy and further delays for both the manpack and Rifleman Radio procurements. With procurements delayed, funding has pushed out.  The president's budget request reflects a 1-year cut in JTRS funding in government fiscal year '15 to around $185 million, rebounding to the $400 million annual level in GFY '16 to '19 pending the resolution of sequestration. The GFY '15 funding cut is likely due to the significant carryover of unspent funds from prior years that's built up from procurement delays. Earlier this month, progress was made when the Army finalized and awarded the $988 million multi-vendor IDIQ contract for SRW or Soldier Radio Waveform appliqu\u00e9 systems. Our offering is for 2 different solutions, and with our SRW appliqu\u00e9s already proven and fielded with the Army, we feel confident about our ability to compete. Prior to contract award, Harris received a $4.3 million order from the Army in July of 2013 and to date has sold $10 million in appliqu\u00e9s to the Army for earlier BCT fieldings. Now I want to highlight a couple of new product milestones in the quarter. We received our first order from a DoD customer for the new RF-340M multichannel manpack, which was originally developed to compete in the Army's JTRS procurement. This first order not only validates our solution but has appealed to customers other than the Army. And we're seeing strong interest from customers in the international markets as well. Our multichannel manpack is 1/3 smaller and lighter than the HMS program of record radio, and all of the waveforms are incorporated into the radio so the soldier doesn't need to carry add-on appliqu\u00e9s to run a full set of waveforms. We also designed expansion slots into the radio for accommodating a customer's unique mission requirements such as specialized waveforms, ISR capabilities like data links and signal detection or commercial SATCOM access. And we're taking this same radio to the airborne tier, where we'll have an equally capable and differentiated product. Another encouraging milestone on the JTRS front was receiving NSA certification on the RF-330E Wideband Team Radio, which was developed for the upcoming rifleman radio competition. And I'll finally mention reaching an important product milestone for incorporating the powerful MUOS waveform into our radios, successfully passing the fourth consecutive test event. MUOS, or the Mobile User Objective System, is the DoD's next-generation military SATCOM system, which I should mention also uses Harris reflectors and will deliver cellular-based service through tactical radios. We're not only embedding this critical capability into our new multichannel manpack but offering it as a separate software upgrade for existing Falcon III 117G wideband radios. This creates a unique opportunity to add MUOS capability to potentially 30,000 fielded Harris radios through a simple and fast software upgrade. It provides the DoD with a cost-effective and compelling solution for rapidly transitioning its inventory to MUOS-capable radios, and is an excellent way to maximize the use of the satellite infrastructure while awaiting JTRS procurements. And our customers agree. During the quarter, we received a $45 million order from a DoD customer who had current wideband radio requirements but also wanted the added flexibility of a software upgrade pack for future enhancements such as MUOS. This followed an initial order for $26 million that we received from this customer in May of last year. Now turning to Government Communications. Revenue was up 11% and higher again this quarter in all 3 business areas of civil, national intelligence and defense.  Diversification and leveraging core technologies to address adjacencies with existing and new customers is providing resiliency in the current budget environment. An excellent example of this success is the Aireon hosted payload program, which was a major revenue driver in the quarter, successfully completing critical milestone testing and beginning full rate production. Under the original agreement, Harris is providing 81 ADS-B receiver payloads to be flown on Iridium NEXT to provide a satellite-based global aircraft tracking system, a capability separate from the main mission of a constellation. But we've also added other customers and so far have increased the number of payloads by almost 50% above the original contract with the potential to add more, significantly increasing the value of this program.  This piggyback approach of using commercially hosted payloads to support multiple missions, both government and commercial, is more cost effective and significantly shortens the time to mission compared to the historical model of building and launching separate exquisite satellite solutions for each and every mission requirement. Harris is at the forefront of this new approach. The Aireon program is the largest implementation of a commercially hosted satellite payload to date, leveraging our long and successful history of supplying space electronics and reflectors for government and commercial markets. In Integrated Network Solutions, the segment continues to be less resilient in the current environment and posted a weaker-than-expected quarter. IT Services, the profitable NMCI contract is winding down by the end of the fiscal year, and new awards have been slow to materialize. In Healthcare Solutions, we're implementing our new software platform at initial customer sites. And while we're making progress in proving out the technology, we need scale to reach profitability. In CapRock, the commercial business is progressing nicely and had good growth in the quarter but was more than offset by government weakness. The bottom line is that we're not satisfied with the results in this segment, and we're increasing our focus to improve performance. Now before moving to the discussion on segment information, I'd like to take a moment and introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Mick Lopez. Mick joined us in February, and he brings more than 30 years of experience across a number of different companies such as IBM, Cisco Systems and Tyco. He joined us from a company called Aricent, a global services company owned by KKR and their affiliates where he was Chief Financial Officer. Mick has served in all the various finance functions in the U.S. as well as internationally in Brazil and Europe. He is a seasoned global finance executive who brings a passion for developing talent and driving excellence in financial systems and processes. So with that introduction, I'll turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and revised guidance for fiscal 2014. Mick? Miguel A. Lopez: Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. It's a real privilege to join the team at Harris. Moving to segment results on Slide 5. RF Communications orders were $405 million compared to $486 million in the prior year. Revenue was $457 million, up 9% from $418 million last year. In Tactical Communications, orders were $285 million compared to $297 million in the prior year. Tactical revenue was $335 million, up 21% from $276 million last year. In international, revenue and orders were strong and higher than in the prior year. In the United States, both revenue and orders were weak but in line with our internal expectations. Public Safety orders were $120 million compared to $189 million in the prior year. Revenue was $122 million compared to $142 million last year. The Public Safety market was weaker than expected. Operating income for the RF Communications segment was $144 million with a 31.4% operating margin. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, operating margin was 30.8%. For the full year in RF Communications, we continue to expect flat revenue for the segment. Tactical Communications revenue is up mid-single digit, which is slightly higher than previously expected on strength in international but offset by weakness in Public Safety. We now expect operating margin to be in a range of 30.5% to 31%. Let's turn now to Integrated Network Solutions segment on Slide 6. Despite growth in the commercial side of the segment, both orders and revenues were down compared to the prior year as a result of continued government market weakness. Revenue decreased 7% to $348 million and was down across the segment in IT Services, CapRock and Healthcare. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, revenue would have been down 6% with government weakness more than offsetting a double-digit increase in commercial CapRock revenue. Segment operating income was $21 million, and operating margin was 6.1%. Excluding the out-of-period adjustments, operating margin was 7.3%. IT Services orders included a $21 million follow-on order from the Canadian Department of National Defense for the CF-18 Avionics Optimized Weapons Systems Support program. CapRock orders included $17 million from an international oil and gas drilling company. At Healthcare Solutions, we introduced FusionFX, a vendor-neutral suite of software tools that brings together patient information across the entire continuum of care. FusionFX provides flexibility and scalability as health systems grow, merge and consolidate. The solution is currently live in 3 customers covering 29 hospitals and has over 1,000 clinician and 40,000 patient users. For the full year, segment revenue is now expected to be down 8% to 9% and operating margin in the range of 7% to 8%. Moving to Slide 7. Revenue in Government Communications segment was $477 million, increasing 11% from last year. Major revenue drivers included the Army's MET SATCOM terminals, F-35, FAA's NextGen DataComm program and the Aireon hosted payload program. Operating income was $77 million compared with $67 million in the prior year, and operating margin was 16.2%. Excluding the out-of-period adjustment, operating margin was 15.2%. Harris was awarded an 8-year, single-award IDIQ follow-on contract for $133 million for the U.S. Navy's Commercial Broadband Satellite program, bringing total potential program value to more than $250 million. Harris also received awards from classified customers totaling $59 million. For the full year, Government Communications revenue is now expected to be stronger than previously anticipated, at about flat for the year, with an operating margin of about 15.5%. Turning to Slide 8. Free cash flow was $120 million versus $185 million last year. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $55 million compared to $49 million in the prior year due to continued investment in our new facility at Government Communications and enterprise software upgrades at RF Communications. We expect that free cash flow for the year will be about equal to net income. During the quarter, we used $64 million in cash to repurchase about 897,000 shares, which brings year-to-date repurchases to $214 million. We continue to expect full year repurchases of $300 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.8% and is now expected to be about 32.5% for the full year. Let's move on to Slide 9. Fiscal 2014 earnings per share guidance has been increased by $0.10 on the top and bottom end of the range to our new guidance of $4.90 to $5 per share. Revenue is now expected to decline 2% to 3% from last year. Back to you, Bill. William M. Brown: Okay. Well, thank you, Mick. The core of our company is providing mission-critical, advanced communications that are differentiated through innovation and technology. This is reading through in our solid results this quarter and our expectations for the year. Our commercial business model gives us a competitive advantage in the speed in which we develop and field new products with attractive margins. Our commitment to innovation will continue to bear fruit as the DoD adapts to operating under constrained budgets and relies more on industry to invest in new technologies that create affordable solutions that can be delivered quickly. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lucy Guo of Cowen and Company. Lucy Guo - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : This is Lucy Guo calling in for Gautam Khanna. So I wanted to ask about your opportunities in the Middle East. You have talked about continued progress toward a multiyear for Falcon III radios and upgrades in Iraq. And then similarly, Saudi is another area of opportunity. Do you have a better idea on the timing of these? William M. Brown: Well, Lucy. First of all, thank you very much for the question. As I mentioned, the pipeline overall for international -- and I think you're referring specifically to the Tactical business, so let me just clarify that. The total pipeline is $2.3 billion. It was $2.2 billion last time. So it's still pretty good, and we've got about $900 million that are in the sort of the final stages, closure or proposal stage. So we're feeling pretty good about the advancement of opportunities through the pipeline. To your point about the Middle East, well, more than half of our pipeline is for the Middle East and Asia, and it really does relate to those issues I've talked about in the past, the security issues we do see, the U.S. pulling back from those markets. Iraq is a very big opportunity for us, and we've been working on this for a number of years. We've got an extremely good dealer in place there. It's probably one of the biggest multiyear opportunities that Harris and Tactical faces. We just yesterday were able to confirm that we received our very first order in the last couple of years in Iraq. It's for $15 million. So that is going to be booked in the coming days. We received confirmation last night. So that to me, Lucy, is good encouragement that these opportunities that we've been talking about for quite some time in Iraq are progressing, and we do see opportunities that are quite a bit larger than that in the near-term pipeline. We continue to have very, very strong business with that country in Northern Africa that we've talked about before. The UAE is a very big opportunity for us, as is Saudi, and we booked a number opportunities over the last year, year and a half. And we see more coming down the path. And that's a little more than half of our total pipeline for international. The other 25% or so is coalition countries that are deploying wideband. That's gaining some strength. We see continued -- about 15% of our pipeline in Latin America, in Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, remain the biggest opportunities in those marketplaces. But of course, there's other opportunities really around the world that are a little bit smaller in nature. But clearly, the biggest opportunity is in the Middle East, and I'm glad to be able to say that we've seen one come through the pipe late last night in Iraq. So thank you, Lucy. Lucy Guo - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : So as a follow-up, the SRW opportunity that you had booked an IDIQ contract on, how shall we think about that going forward? William M. Brown: Well, I think we're very well positioned. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were 1 of 2 that have actually been selling SRW appliqu\u00e9s to the Army. They've been tested. We have actually 2 solutions that were bid. Of course, as you saw in the press release, there's 4 companies that received IDIQ awards, but we feel very good, very well positioned. And frankly, we're encouraged about the size of the IDIQ, $988 million total contract value, total possibility. And we're also encouraged by the fact that it is now finally out in the street and awarded, which means that there's some intention to place some orders against it, Lucy. So we're encouraged. Operator : Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Nice growth year-over-year. If I look at the guidance implied for the fourth quarter, it suggests less of a sequential increase than you typically see. Was there anything unusual about the third quarter results that make the fourth quarter compare more challenging this year? Is the seasonality in that business changing? Just if you can give us some sense of kind of what's been happening below the surface there. William M. Brown: Yair, are you talking about revenue or operating margin? Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Revenue. But if you want to speak to operating margin, that will be helpful as well. William M. Brown: Well, the revenue was up quite a bit in the quarter only because -- partly because of the easy compare, and I think we acknowledged that in the prepared remarks last year around third quarter. You remember, with sequestration being triggered, that caused some disruption in the business. But tactical international was extremely strong in the quarter, and that was the big driver in our third quarter. On the margin side, we did see very, very good margins over the course of the first 3 quarters of the year sort of on average for RF Comm in the 31.5% range. Of course, Mick did mention that we had a modest out-of-period adjustment that did help us in Q3 in the RF Comm segment. We've been saying before, and I'll mention it again today, that we do see our R&D investments, sales and marketing investments, ramping quite a bit. It didn't ramp as much in Q3 as we had anticipated, but they certainly will ramp pretty steeply in Q4 primarily for these modernization opportunities in the manpack and the MUOS developments that we've been focused on and I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we do see a pretty substantial ramp in investment coming in Q4. And also, we're a little bit impacted in the quarter by mix in the international side. So through the year, we're still in that 30.5% to 31%, and we feel pretty good about where we happen to be. And I think if you look at the numbers closely, you'll see that we're going to be up sequentially in Q4 from Q3. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Got it, okay. And then just another one on RF. In terms of the U.S. pipeline, can you reconcile the comments on the one hand in terms of the pipeline being up a little bit quarter-on-quarter? On the other hand, if you look at the 5-year budget for the DoD, it looks like there are pretty significant cuts in the forecasts in terms not just of JTRS but also of the MNVR radio. William M. Brown: Yes, I would say, look, we -- we're floating around $900 million to $1 billion. And frankly, we're encouraged it's stable. I wouldn't read too much versus into $900 million versus $1 billion. Of course, you know that we get funding not just for those -- from those typical line items you see. At the high level, in comes in lots of line items buried in budgets, including from some O&M accounts. So I wouldn't -- yes, we're aware of some of the push-out of some of the bigger things that we've talked about in Army modernization, but there's lots of line items that drive it. So we feel comfortable at about $1 billion of pipeline. We are seeing, with the drawdown of activities in Iraq drawn down and Afghanistan drawing down, that there are some reset opportunities that are coming to bear. There are some modernization opportunities outside of the Army that are entering the pipeline. More than half of our pipeline itself is Air Force, Marine Corps, SOCOM modernization. And we've said before, they standardized on the Falcon III technology. So that still remains robust. And -- but if you go into the line item details, SOCOM funding remains pretty strong. We only see about 10% of our total pipeline related to Army BCT modernization. We do see a lot of other Army programs unrelated to modernization in our pipeline. So overall, about $1 billion, floating between $900 million and $1 billion. But again, I'm encouraged that's remaining about flat in the environment we happen to be in here. Operator : Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just a clarification and a couple of questions for you, Bill. The comment you made around the JTRS appropriations being down, yet the unspent funds, I think you implied, providing a bit of support. Does that kind of point to flattish overall funding profile or work profile there? Or is it just too uncertain with the procurement delays you talked about before? William M. Brown: Yes, no, it's -- well, first of all, it's still very, very uncertain because in the President's budget, it assumes sequestration resolved, as you know, in GFY '16. That's still a wildcard out there. We know that. We recognize that. If you look in his budget for '16, all of the funding line items come back, snap back up. But we'll see, as the next year or 2 go by, whether that's actually going to take place. There is -- there are unspent funds in the JTRS procurement line items from prior years. It's in that range of $300 million, plus or minus. And there's -- I think with a little bit more coming in GFY '15, about $185 million, I think, is what's in the President's budget, we feel pretty good about the overall level of funding. The -- when we'll -- we talk about our own profile here, we've said that the JTRS Army modernization opportunities won't be impacting our fiscal '15. If anything, they're going to start to roll in, in our fiscal '16, and we've said that in our last call as well. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, great. And on the INS side, Mick, I wondered if you might help us clarify. With respect to that 6% adjusted decline in revenues, how did the pieces compare to that average in terms of above or below at IT Services and Healthcare and CapRock? Miguel A. Lopez: Yes, let me give some clarification about the out-of-period adjustments. As we noted, there were 2 of them. Neither is significant for total Harris and especially when netted out. And as we said, in total, they provided only $0.02 of earnings per share. For INS, there were the 2, where one was on post-employment benefits adjustment and the other one negatively affected their revenues and cost. The one for post-employment benefits positively impacted ESA, which is engineering sales and admin expenses, for all the segments. And for INS, we had some of that, but we also had about -- a drop in the revenue and a small increase in charges for the cost, and that dropped their margin by 1.2%. [Indiscernible]. William M. Brown: Yes, within -- yes, within INS, most of the positive benefit affected the IT Services business, and most of the negative benefit was booked within the CapRock segment. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, but with respect to -- you highlighted the downward pressure on the government SATCOM piece at CapRock. Was the CapRock piece the low -- the largest decliner in the quarter of the sub-groups? Miguel A. Lopez: Go ahead. William M. Brown: I'm not sure I'm following the question, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Within -- I was saying with respect to the whole group's sales growth, I'm trying to figure out, which one of the sub-groups within there was the largest decliner. I'm just trying to put some numbers around the comments around the declines at each one of the businesses. William M. Brown: Yes, I think HITS was -- the IT Services business was down, as well as the government part of both CapRock and Healthcare were both down. And they were down pretty substantially in the quarter HITS. So in the sort of the in the 10%-ish range. And the other 2 businesses are down in -- north of 20%. But what we're encouraged by was the growth on the commercial side of CapRock, which was up in the quarter by 6% reported. When we adjust for this out-of-period adjustment that Mick mentioned, that affected revenue as well, CapRock commercial was up about 12% in the quarter. So hopefully, that hit the question, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes, that totally helps. And then with respect to the comment in Healthcare that you made about scale, I mean, obviously, you've been through quite a restructuring process there and product rollout and whatnot. When you think about the scale you need to have to reach the kind of levels of profitability that you've outlined in the past, how does that compare to where you are today? William M. Brown: Well, look, we've -- we have to grow the business. What I was encouraged about over the last 3 or 4 months is that the solution that we call FusionFX now, that the solution that's now installed and operating at 3 different customers, 29 hospitals, is stable, is performing well. Customer are excited about it. There's more clinicians coming on to the system, more patients coming on to the system. And I'm encouraged by this very complicated piece of software is stable. And that was our first hurdle to get over, was getting a piece of technology that worked, and I think we have something. Now what we have to do is find partners to help us grow and scale the business. This -- Harris is not -- does not have deep domain expertise in commercial health care. We don't have a robust channel that's built. And we're going to need some support, some partner help in growing our business. It will need to grow pretty substantially on the commercial side for us to reach profitability. But it's more important -- not so much the size, but as -- the mix has to shift from installing systems to converting to license revenue. And that will happen, Carter, as we bring on more customers and start to grow the business and scale the business. Operator : And our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It's actually Chris Sands on for Joe. I was hoping you could elaborate on kind of the outlook for Public Safety. It was kind of down again sequentially in the quarter. You talked about orders being up in the first half, but they wouldn't translate soon enough. When can we expect that to kind turn? William M. Brown: Well, look, as we talked about last time, the -- in Public Safety, the issues that we're seeing is both market and execution. And I talked a lot about last time some of the sort of executional issues that we're seeing. Some of it is delayed rollouts of some systems. There are some customer issues that are associated with that. Some of it is getting in early enough on large procurements so we can shape the RFPs where we're adding sales and marketing resources, we're adding resources to improve our product offering. All of those things, we're working on. We've got some new leadership in place. We're augmenting our teams. But as I cautioned last time, these things will take time. They won't fix themselves over 1 or 2 quarters. It'll take a little bit of time. What we're also facing now today, though, Chris, is a weaker environment, and that is a little bit worse than we expected last quarter. And I think as our peers and competitors in the space will report, we're all seeing a bit of weakness. Part of it may be some of the rebanding that happened 1.5 years, 2 years ago and the effect it had on the overall market. We are seeing municipal budgets be better, but it's not flowing through into an uptick yet in Public Safety communications. That will over time, but we're not seeing it at the moment. It could be -- and I think it -- we have to believe that the prospect and uncertainty around how LTE will roll out has to be having some impact on how customers are thinking about investments in LMR digital technology with the prospect of LTE down the path. So we don't know how this is all going to shake itself out. We do see our Q4 being better than Q3, but I'm not going to call success in Q4, and we'll come back in late July when we give our Q4 report and our full year fiscal report and give some guidance for next year. We'll have a lot more insight into what's happening in the market, our ability to compete and what that might be for fiscal '15. But again, the market's a little bit softer today than we had first expected. Longer term, we know what's going to happen here. We know the customers' analog systems will have to shift to digital. We know that LTE is going to come at some point in time and customers will shift again. That's going to be a growth driver for the company. It's going to be a driver for the market itself. And we're investing to be prepared to be successful when those things happen. Christopher Sands - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. And then just a follow-up and switching to Government Comms. The margin was strong in the quarter. I mean, if you think going forward is around 16% something you can sustain going into fiscal '15? Or if not, what are some of the moving pieces there? William M. Brown: Yes. I wouldn't get too far ahead of yourself on 16%. I think we had a very strong quarter. Again, it was 16.2%. But again, keep in mind, it was -- when you adjust for sort of the onetime, it was on the order of about 15.2%. So pretty much in line with where we've been year-to-date and what we're guiding to for the year. So again, we're still in that 15% to 15.5% range. The team in GCS continues to execute very, very well. The award fees, certainly in the front half of the year, were very, very good. We see -- we continue to see margins in this 13% to 14% being sustainable over time in GCS. Keep in mind as you know the market very, very well, as you roll on new programs, they tend to come in at lower margins. And over time, as you work and you drive efficiencies, you can try to extend the margins is what we've seen. So it will depend upon the mix of new programs. As we see, like the DCIS, the NVS, programs in FAA roll in, they tend to come in at lower margins, and that's going to impact GCS over time. So I'd keep in my mind 13% to 14%, not 16%. Operator : Our last question is from Josh Sullivan of Sterne Agee. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I'll just go back into that government operating margin question. You guys, obviously, did a lot of restructuring last year, and it's obviously having an impact here. But can you maybe give us an idea of the longevity of these actions just given your fixed contract mix and these re-competes coming up? I mean, how should we think of timing-wise that rolling through? William M. Brown: Yes, look, the -- clearly, 15%, 15.5% margins this year are positively impacted by some of the restructuring activities. It's impacted by some of the activities in driving operational excellence at GCS. A lot of it is they just have been performing very, very well. They've got tremendous customer intimacy. And that -- when you perform well on time with that focus on the customer mission, what ends up happening is the award fees tend to be relatively strong, and that's, in fact, what happened. In operational excellence, when we provide guidance to investors in this area, we do it specifically knowing that some of what we say needs to go back to the customer when we have cost-plus-type programs. Roughly half of GCS is fixed price and roughly half is cost-plus. So a lot of what we see in restructuring and operational excellence programs does roll through and affect our ROS. And that is what you're seeing this year, in fact last year in the growth over the last couple of years. Again, as we go out into next year, we'll provide guidance in late July on what we see to be the revenue and market environment, the ROS for GCS into fiscal '15. But again, I keep in my mind in that 13%, 14% range over time as opposed to the very strong performance we're seeing this year of around 15.5%. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then one last one on CapRock. The government weakness, how much of that is related to just OPTEMPO in Afghanistan versus, say, sequestration? William M. Brown: It's some of that but not the bulk of it. A lot of it has to do with 1 year or 2 ago, the -- there was a contract vehicle that was opened up and competed on with some of the satellite owners, and they won a contract vehicle and they are basically providing some bandwidth directly to the U.S. government, which in the past went through \"brokers\" like our CapRock government business. So that is now going direct, and it's impacting our business. We're seeing some pricing pressure in our terrestrial business as well, which has been opened to competition as well. We're seeing some pressure on that side. There is some related to the drawdown. That's not bulk of it. Pamela A. Padgett: All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us.

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett. And on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; and Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press release and on this teleconference and the related presentation, we will discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the tables of our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of this call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Bill with that I'll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Thank you Pam and good morning everybody. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings were solid and we generated significant free cash flow. For the full fiscal year revenue and earnings per share came in at the high-end of our guidance range and free cash flow is excellent and exceeded our goal for the year. Our strategy to lower cost, invest in R&D to drive growth, maximize free cash flow and return cash to shareholders is servicing as well as we operate within what is still a constrained a U.S. government spending environment. Turning to slide 3 and 4 of the presentation, revenue was down 2% in the fourth quarter and the fiscal year and although the government market is having an effect particularly in our U.S. tactical and IT services businesses. Several growth areas with good momentum are minimizing the impact. International growth continues to be strong and was up 8% in the quarter and 13% for the year driven largely by the tactical radio business although our CapRock business is also contributing. CapRock which participates in the global maritime and energy markets had revenue growth in all four quarters, excellent second half orders and a full year book to bill greater than one. As a percentage of total revenue international increased from 26% in the prior year to now 30%. Our government communications business is bucking the trend with modest growth in both the quarter and full year showing great resiliency. While the specific revenue drivers vary quarter-to-quarter for the segment, our strategy to grow the core by leveraging strong franchises to create new opportunities in the areas of space and intelligence, air traffic management, geospatial imaginary, avionics and weather is working well and is gaining momentum. Turning to earnings, EPS was a $1.28 in the fourth quarter and $5 for the fiscal year, 2% higher than prior year non-GAAP EPS of $4.90. Fiscal \u201914 earnings benefited for more than $100 million in cost savings related to prior year restructuring actions and ongoing operational excellence initiatives with some of those savings funding investment for the future. Company funded R&D was up 30% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the year to 5.3% of total revenue. A level significantly higher than peer companies in which when combined with savings from OpEx initiatives allows us to continue delivering innovative and affordable solutions. Free cash flow was $334 million in the quarter and $640 million for the year, an excellent 120% of net income driven by very strong working capital performance. CapEx for the year was $201 million up $23 million from the prior year for investments in new systems and infrastructure to support growth. We continue to return cash to shareholders with $300 million in share repurchases for the year higher than a $200 million target we set at the beginning of fiscal \u201914. And during the year we increased our dividend by 40%, 90% compounded annually over the last three years. Orders in the quarter were about $1.1 billion, sequentially flat with a third quarter and down versus the strong prior year quarter with funded backlog declining 5% year-over-year. Book to bill for the year was just under 1 at 0.97. Turning now to some segment highlights, in RF Communications international tactical revenue was up 11% in the quarter and 25% for the year and opportunities in the international tactical market remain relatively healthy. Our 12 to 18 month pipeline is 2.5 billion up from last quarter\u2019s 2.3 billion driven modestly higher by additional early stage opportunities. We\u2019re also encouraged by the pipeline replenishing itself on the heels of 25% revenue growth and a number of large bookings in the year including a $78 million fourth quarter order from a country in Central Asia. Opportunities with the government of Iraq remain an important part of our pipeline and they continue to progress. We received the first $50 million order in Q4 and we have signed a contract on the next tranche and are working through the process of securing a letter of credit. Other significant opportunities are looking strong and have grown a bit in the quarter include a few in Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines and Mexico. In the U.S. our tactical business was somewhat weaker than expected in the quarter. Our 12 to 18 month pipeline in the U.S. remains in a $900 million to $1 billion range but the velocity of opportunities moving through the pipeline is slow with budget constraints delaying procurements. While we eliminated the JTRS HMS opportunity from our pipeline last quarter there has been a lot happening recently regarding the JTRS procurement process and funding outlook that\u2019s worth spending a few minutes on. The good news is that under Secretary Kendall signed the new multi-vendor acquisition strategy for JTRS HMS, a significant milestone for Harris that allows us to compete for a multi-billion dollar multi-year radio opportunity. A draft RFP for the Rifleman Radio was released as well as draft technical requirement for the Manpack. And the army has now stated that the full rate production will begin in GFY \u201917. For Harris this implies test units towards the end of our fiscal \u201916 with the more significant revenue opportunity in fiscal \u201917, about a year delay from what was previously anticipated. This new schedule creates fielding gaps for future capability sets and the good news for vendors like Harris is that the army has said that there are no plans for another LRIP production order for the JTRS Manpack. And as a result we believe this decision creates opportunities to fill the fielding gaps with Harris SRW appliques, MNVR radios and 117Gs all of which support the JTRS waveforms. Not surprisingly the procurement delay is resulting in proposed GFY \u201915 funding cuts and a reduction of prior year funds. Based on recent information from the appropriations committees unspent funds for JTRS HMS at the end of government fiscal year \u201915 will be a bit less than previously anticipated but still significant at $200 million to $300 million. In terms of future funding we\u2019re encouraged by the latest SAR or Selected Acquisition Report that still shows army radio modernization as a roughly 10 year $5 billion market opportunity for Harris. Clearly the need for improved tactical communications remains one of the U.S. military\u2019s highest priorities. And while the official JTRS HMS moderation program has pushed out, the army\u2019s current generation radios don\u2019t support networking or the high speed data rates that delivery critical real time information like situation awareness and video to war fighters operating in theater. So we continue to invest to position us to be successful in any scenario as the U.S. army, other U.S. services in the international military modernize. In fiscal \u201914 R&D spend was up 8% in RF Communications and 36% in the fourth quarter. Investments included incorporating the MUOS waveform into our products as well as development of our multi-channel Manpack radio where we continue to make good progress. In June we received NSA certification for the Manpack a significant milestone needed for deliveries to begin. We anticipated that the army would be our first customer but given procurement delays the manpack will roll out first to other U.S. customers with our first order from the U.S. Navy scheduled for delivery in October. Our tactical team has done an excellent job in designing this product and we believe that as it gets fielded strong interest in the U.S. in international markets will quickly build. In government communication systems we had several significant wins to highlight, two of which were in the commercially hosted satellite payload market. In the fourth quarter we booked a $63 million order for new payload program on the Iridium Next constellation. The same platform that host the Aireon payload which put Harris at the forefront of this unique piggy back approach of using a commercially hosted payload to provide multiple missions on satellites. Following the close of the quarter we also received a five year $495 million multi-vendor IDIQ contract from the U.S. Airforce for hosted payload solutions program which provides us a contract vehicle to pursue additional opportunities and further extend our leadership position. Another strategic win in the quarter for government communications was from the national geospatial intelligence agency for two five year single award IDIQ contracts totaling $773 million for the foundation geocontent management program. The awards cover 2 or 3 regions, $365 million for region A that covers the U.S. specific and Northern Commands and $408 million for region C that covers the U.S. Africa and Southern Commands. With the award we received an initial order in region A while region C is currently under protest with resolution expected mid-September. Now this win is really important for Harris, it builds off a 20 plus relationship with the NGA that\u2019s grown from trusted partner to now the leader in geospatial imaginary. Dating back to 2000, Harris was one of 15 suppliers and overtime became one of six and now one of two imaginary suppliers to the NGA, with Harris providing two thirds of NGAs global coverage. This program is expected to more than double our current geospatial revenue and create additional expansion opportunities in the U.S. and abroad. So with that I will turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance for fiscal \u201915 and then I will come back with a few closing comments. Mick? Mick Lopez : Thank you Bill. Good morning to everyone. Moving to segment results on slide 5, RF Communications revenue was $493 million down 1% compared to prior year. Segment orders were $361 million compared to $646 million last year. In tactical communications revenue was $348 million up 4% over the prior year with strong international revenue growth of 11% more than offsetting lower revenue in the U.S. A soft U.S. market also dampened orders which were 232 million in the quarter. This compares to prior year orders of 498 million which benefited from strong international bookings. In public safety, revenue was a 145 million down 12% compared to a 165 million in the prior year. Continuing weakness in the state and local market also impacted orders which were 129 million compared to 148 million in the prior year. Operating income for the RF Communication segment was a 141 million and operating margin was 28.5% reflecting the planned increase in R&D spending. For the full year operating margin was 30.7%. Now turning to integrated network solution segment on slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue was 373 million down 9% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth in commercial CapRock and commercial healthcare was more than offset by continued U.S. government market weakness. Segment operating income was 33 million compared to non-GAAP operating income of 36 million in the prior year primarily as a result of lower revenue volume. Operating margin was 8.7% slightly higher than non-GAAP operating margin of 8.6% in the prior year with improved operating performance in CapRock and healthcare offset by lower operating margin in IT services. We were encouraged by the progress made during the quarter in healthcare. With the roll out of our new vendor neutral suite of interoperability solutions called Fusion FX. The number of live deployments grew from 29 to 45 hospitals and we now have over 50,000 users on our systems. Moving to slide 7, revenue in government communication systems was 480 million increasing 2% compared to the prior year. Higher revenue from classified customers FAA\u2019s Data Com program, the F-35 program and the U.S. Navy\u2019s commercial broadband satellite program were partially offset by lower revenue from NASA\u2019s Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program and NOAA's GOES-R Weather Program. Segment operating income was 69 million and operating margin was 14.4% in the quarter and a strong 15.4% for the full year. Turning to slide 8, the company generated free cash flow of $334 million compared to 273 million in the prior year. CapEx was 61 million compared to 47 million last year. For the full year free cash flow came in at a strong 648 million and operating cash was a record high driven by a 12 day improvement in net working capital. In the quarter we repurchased about 1.1 million shares or total cash outlay of 86 million and our effective tax rate was 32.3%. Moving to slide 9, and fiscal \u201915 guidance. In RF Communications we expect revenue to be flat to down 3% with continuing revenue growth in international tactical. A soft U.S. tactical market due to slow government spending in the first half that should improve once the budget is passed and about flat public safety revenue. Operating margin for the segment is expected to be consistent with this year in a range of 30% to 31%. An integrated network solutions, revenues expected to be down 7% to 8% with solid revenue growth in CapRock and healthcare more than offset by declining revenue in IT services due to the roll-off of the NMCI contract and the decision to no longer sell low margin pass through products. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 7% to 8% with improved operating performance at CapRock and healthcare more than offset by the roll off of the highly profitable NMCI contract. Government communications revenue is expected to be flat to up 2%, expected revenue drivers in fiscal \u201915 include classified programs, hosted payloads, geospatial and the ramp up of F-35 production and are providing good visibility for first half growth. Segment operating margin is expected to be around 15% for the year. We\u2019re expecting a 32.5% tax rate which does not assume any benefit from R&D tax credit and corporate expense is expected to be about 5% lower for the year. For total Harris, revenues expected to be down 1% to 3% and EPS in the range of $4.75 to $5 with a bit more pressure in the first half on a year-over-year basis than in the second half. Free cash flow is expected to be around a 100% of net income with CapEx of about $200 million. Our guidance reflects $200 million of share repurchases in the year. Now back to you Bill. Bill Brown : Thank you Mick. As our fiscal \u201915 guidance reflects we\u2019re anticipating a similar constrain budget environment to what we experienced in our fiscal \u201914 with the government operating in the first part of GFY \u201915 under a continuing resolution. Under a CR, our experience is that spending is generally slow with new starts on hold as customers either don\u2019t spend or spend reluctantly until they have clarity for each specific budget line. So for Harris we will continue to make sure our cost structure reflects the current environment and our organizational structure is optimized for success. And we will stay the course with what\u2019s working in this environment lowering cost, investing in technology and innovation to drive growth, maximizing free cash flow and returning excess cash to our shareholders. I\u2019m really proud of what our teams have accomplished this past year and we\u2019re committed to driving value for shareholders while meeting the needs of our customers for high quality, innovative and affordable solutions and with that I would like to the ask operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question is from (indiscernible) of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Omer Ismail - Goldman Sachs : This is Omer filling in for Nova. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on capital deployment options here and also in particular how are you guys thinking about the portfolio after the initial actions that you took and are you going to consider any potential M&A whether it be major even or a tug here or there? Bill Brown : I\u2019m not going to comment today on any potential portfolio actions or M&A but I would say that there is no recent event that\u2019s changing our strategy from the past on capital allocation. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and what we have always been doing is a smart and in an efficient way. If you look back over the last 3 years we have returned close to 90% of our free cash to shareholders in the form of repurchases of dividends. Our number one priority has been and will remain funding internal requirements and I think we have proven ourselves to be able to do that through capital spending and R&D investment. We continue to pay an attractive dividend, we have got a strong track record of double digit growth and I talked a bit about that in my remarks, 19% compounded over the last three years. As we move back this past year we started out the year at $200 million target for share buyback and we ended up $300 million. If you look at the last three years it's $1.2 billion in share buyback so it's been a pretty healthy amount of shares repurchased in the marketplace reducing our share count by about 15% and again we\u2019re guiding it at $200 million of shares as you know from our balance sheet we don\u2019t have any debt due until the end of 2017 and we continue to focus on generating strong free cash flow. I think our fiscal \u201914 results point to that. We\u2019re targeting next year 100% of that income again certainly our executive team is now incentivized on free cash flow and that\u2019s been a change in the last couple of years and I think the results are showing through on our numbers and we will continue to reevaluate overtime how we deploy our capital. So thank you very much Omer. Omer Ismail - Goldman Sachs : Just another quick follow-up, you did discuss the international and tactical radio trends for the quarter and the year there. What was international book to bill both for the quarter and the year and is there any timing profile that you can give us an update on as to how we think about these awards for that ex-fiscal year? Bill Brown : We don\u2019t talk about the individual components within tact between U.S. and international in terms of bookings or book to bill or things of that nature. I think as you\u2019ve seen in the report the tactical book to bill in the quarter was about 0.67 for the year and it ended up about 0.86. The international business as I mentioned in my remarks was very, very strong, it was up 25% and it ended the year very strong in Q4, with up 11. And as I did mention the pipeline is strong at about $2.5 billion up a bit from the last time. So we remain encouraged by the trends that we\u2019re seeing on the international side. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. You may begin. Joe Nadol - JPMorgan:  On the \u201915 outlook what is your plan for domestic versus international tactical radio growth if you are willing to share that? Bill Brown : At RF, overall it's flat to down 3 and we see tactical down low single-digits. We see the international side up low single digits and on the DoD side down low double digits so read that 10% - 12% in that range. So that\u2019s a complete -- I mean PSPC is about flat just sort of complete the circle on the RF Com segment. Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: And then just on the international front, you upped -- you did some commentary certainly already and you upped your pipeline and you said I think it was early stage opportunities. I was wondering if maybe you could help us think through that 2.5 billion from a timing standpoint, are there near term bulky or good size orders out there that you think you can pull in before the end of the calendar year and then maybe a little more color on what the early stage opportunities look like? Bill Brown : Yes the pipeline came up a little bit and it was as I did mention some earlier stage opportunities but we still feel very confident about the size of the pipeline. As I mentioned coming off the year where we booked a lot of good orders and grew our business by 25% which I think is astounding to see the pipeline replenish itself and actually grow a little bit. I think it's very, very significant to us. We see about 750 million of that 2.5 billion that are in the proposal closure finalization stage so the probability is very high. The timing Joe, as you know is always a bit difficult to predict. The shape of the pipeline looks pretty much in-line with what I mentioned last time, it's slightly more than half the Middle-East and Central Asia where we know that our number of security concerns you can pick up a paper and read about that quite a bit and U.S. is pulling back. Iraq is significant, I mentioned that last time and it remains a significant component of our pipeline today. It's both the Ministry of Interior as well as the Ministry of Defense we booked an order very recently in Q4, it's little small but I think it was significant. It has gotten through the vast majority of the licensing from the U.S. government. So it feels very, very good. We see opportunities in the country in Northern Africa that remained very robust, it's a Phase IV of what has been a long term multi-phased program for us where we have actually if constructed in-country assembly facility so we know we have got a lot of staying power with that particular country and then within the Middle-East the UAE looked strong, Jordon looked strong, Oman is strong, Saudi has gotten a little bit bigger over the last couple of months to quarter and we feel fairly good about those opportunities. The balance, the other half or little less than half are just as we have mentioned before collision countries, it's countries in APAC like Australia, Philippines and others, and in Latin America, Brazil looks pretty good, Mexico looks pretty good. As you know Brazil we were chosen for the early part of the (indiscernible) program, we see that accelerating through fiscal \u201915. Long list of other opportunities but in general Joe, that is sort of shape of the pipeline. Joe Nadol - JPMorgan: And then just one more, R&D you mentioned I think was 5.3% in terms of IRAD. What\u2019s your plan for FY \u201915? Bill Brown : Well when you look back since I came here 2.5 years ago we were about 4% of our revenue being spent in IRAD, Internal R&D and now IRAD is 5.3% so it has come up quite a bit in the last 2.5 - 3 years and we tried to point it towards those businesses where we have strong returns and strong growth opportunities based on technology and innovation so we pointed it directly at our tactical business and we have stepped up quite a bit as well in our government communications business. So it's 5.3%, it's a pretty healthy amount of spend. We believe we\u2019re fully funding the best opportunities. We\u2019re looking across the company now as a portfolio, as opposed to looking at the individual businesses on a (indiscernible) basis. We have a significant amount of engagement by our Board in R&D since it's such a significant investment and strategic to the company but as I go forward into \u201915 we may see a slight tick-up but not to the magnitude we have seen in the last two to three years Joe. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin. Carter Copeland - Barclays: Just quickly on INS. It looks like with the growing pieces that IT services, it looks like it's probably down in the kind of mid-teens range in the guidance for next year, is that right? And can you comment at all on what the sort of underlying trends in the business are at NMCI. Bill Brown : Yes let me sort of start and maybe Mick can jump in here a little bit. Clearly we still are in a relatively constrained government market, the procurements are slow, there has been a lot of competition on the IT services business and the government side of CapRock. Some of it's offset with some improvements on commercial CapRock as well as the commercial healthcare business. As we look out into fiscal \u201915 total INS is down 7% - 8%. We see continued growth on the commercial side of CapRock which we see up high single digits as well as the commercial side of the healthcare business which will be up I guess a small piece up around 20% or so. And that\u2019s going to be offset by a weak U.S. government IT services market, that will be down high-teens so your mid-teens is in the ball-park with more like high-teens. In the U.S. CapRock side of the government side, it will also be down a little bit sort of mid to high single digits but that\u2019s coming off a very, very weak FY \u201914 where our government side of CapRock was down in the mid-20s, say 24% - 25%. I think what\u2019s significant here Carter is that we are seeing two things happening in the IT services businesses, one is the roll-off of the NMCI contract Mick, mentioned that, that\u2019s where the $90 million of revenue and about 40 million of profit roll off between \u201914 and \u201915 and then the other part is we have decided to not sell in the net sense products IDIQ because it's simply passed through, business is coming through a zero gross margin and it is adding nothing to our shareholders. Those two pieces, those two decisions together are a $160 million worth of revenue. So you pull that out and it would make the hits business to be roughly flat year-over-year outside of those two moving parts and hopefully it gives you a little bit of color within INS and I answered your question but let me if there is anything else you want to know about INS? Carter Copeland - Barclays: No that\u2019s exactly it, I wanted to get to what the business looked like ex those movements so that color is really helpful. Just secondly if you could give us a little bit more color on PSPC for next year and the flat guidance there. I wondered if you might just talk about the environment there bookings trend, any challenges on state and local side, just anything to help us understand the directionality of that business next year and then beyond and if your views there have changed at all? Bill Brown : It hasn\u2019t changed a lot in the last three months since the last quarter, the issues we have in PSPC remain two fold, one is both the market itself and the market appears to be getting a little bit weaker than where we were just a couple of months ago and there is execution. I don\u2019t want to pile on the execution issues. They are going to take a number of quarters to fix. We have seen some delays in the roll out of some systems due to some customer issues. I think we\u2019re responding, as I mentioned last time we\u2019re adding on the sales and marketing side. We\u2019re investing in a product offering, we\u2019re investing heavily to improve the quality of our software architecture and our product we\u2019re selling into the field all of which I think are positive things, it will help us overtime but what I have seen is I really spend a little more time on this business. There is no silver bullet here. On the market side it is a bit weaker than where we thought just a few months ago, we now see the market to be down maybe flat to down mid-single digits as supposed to being more flattish and what I think is happening here we\u2019re sort of caught between two pieces one is the rebanning that that happened and ended around January \u201913 that had a positive effect and maybe pull forward some sales. And then on the right hand side or the later side is the investments that are coming down the path on LTE and when I think is we\u2019re sort of stuck in the middle we\u2019re winding down from the rebanning and state and local customers are waiting for the uptick on LTE and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s compressing the market that we\u2019re in today. So, I think the state and local finances are a little bit better but we don\u2019t see that reading through right now in opportunities for public safety. I think when you setup and you look at it longer term we do know that those analog systems that are out there and there is quite a few will shift to digital. LMR will move to LTE overtime. I think we\u2019ve taken all the right steps to take out cost, to position our product to be successful, to upgrade our management team and I know we have got margin expansion opportunity so I think for Harris public safety will be a long term growth story. It is just going to take a little time for that to figure itself out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer. You may begin. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer:  Start with a couple of questions on RF. I think backlog total between tactical and public safety is down about 15% exciting 2014 relative to 2013 but your guidance for 2015 revenue is pretty close to flat. So I\u2019m wondering what is it about either the backlog or the pipeline that gives you confidence that the turns business will be better than it typically is in 2015. Bill Brown : Well I think on public safety we\u2019re coming off of a fairly weak 2014, fiscal \u201914 and in a market that\u2019s softened down a little bit. I think we just hold share, we will see our business stabilize and we feel reasonably confident that we will see better performance in public safety in fiscal \u201915 than \u201914. It may not be up, but we\u2019re guided to be about flat right now. I think on the tactical side look we do know that we\u2019re ending the year with our backlog down a little bit it's about 24% year-over-year it declined sequentially by about 70%. We anticipated some decline or coming off of a pretty strong Q2 and Q3. So we thought that was going to end up happening. Typically what we see in the year is about 60% of our backlog converting to revenue in the subsequent year. We have some multi-year orders in our backlog today. Last year we converted about 60% of our backlog and 40% in the year before it was just over that around 61% - 62% so that\u2019s not unusual. Then we\u2019re also seeing in the 65% to 75% range of new orders converting within the year that\u2019s what we have seen over last couple of years and we expect to see a same trend going into fiscal \u201915. So when you put those two pieces together I think we\u2019re pretty confident about the guidance and the outlook we have for both tactical and public safety. As we come back and look at just where we\u2019re in the pipeline, the DoD pipeline down a little bit sort of the $900 million to $1 billion range so it's holding in there even without any HMS opportunities in there and with the international side remaining relatively healthy at 2.5 billion we do know that some of those opportunities will come to bear in fiscal \u201915 and all that taken together is what gives us confidence on the guidance for next year. Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer: And then in your prepared remarks you referenced I think 200 million to 300 million in unspent JTRS funding. I just want to make sure I understood you correctly, is your belief that will be repurposed in order to fill the fielding gap which will potentially be used for your products and if so over what time span do you expect that $200 million to $300 million to be spent? Bill Brown : The $200 million to $300 million at the end of GFY \u201915 was on the HMS line, on the MNVR we think it's sort of $60 million to $65 million in that range, so just to distinguish that. And yes there are, the army can buy SRW appliques against that funding and they can buy those appliques to plug some of the fielding gap. So that is our hope and expectation that some of that will happen over the course of the fiscal year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from (indiscernible) of Cowen. You may begin. Unidentified Analyst : So a couple of questions, given that JTRS delays that you\u2019ve outlined presumably the overall RF Tactical market opportunity has declined in fiscal \u201916 even though I understand your reported pipeline had already excluded a lot of that JTRS opportunity out. Is that a fair assessment and if in fact the overall market opportunity is going to stretch that a bit. What do you think that should pertain for pricing even in the international market for tactical product? Bill Brown : I think the market itself is going to be flattish in the next couple of years to be honest with you. I think the international side because we\u2019re a big player on the international front. I think the international could be up modestly I think we did capture a little bit of share in our fiscal \u201914 but it could be up modestly in our fiscal \u201915. The fact that the pipeline, that\u2019s over 12 to 18 months sort of hangs in there for U.S. DoD at the $900 million to a $1 billion range is an indication for the size of the market that happens to be out there in U.S. DoD. Just because of the HMS moving out and the funding is not in that pipeline we took that out last time. So that really doesn\u2019t affect the way we see the marketplace. There are number of opportunities that we see coming on resets, modernization and other parts of the military services more than 60% of our U.S. DoD pipeline is outside of the U.S. Army, it's the airforce, it's SOCOM, it's the Marine Corp that are modernizing and standardizing on Harris technology and that still appears reasonably robust. When you talk about pricing we compete every day on pricing both in the U.S. DoD and outside of that and in every discussion we have and every contract we sign there is significant pressure on the pricing side. I think the fact that we bring significant technology to bear, you know product that delivers in the field with very, very, very good quality. I think it allows the hold on our pricing and our margins in the tactical radio business. Unidentified Analyst : Don\u2019t want to delever [ph] the point but you understand my question is not how you define the market it's how -- it's sort of how all players that the supply products that compete with RF tactical define the market and imagine on a net basis even though your pipeline is flat to up sequentially maybe the rest of the world wouldn\u2019t see it that way and presumably drive some pricing pressure but I guess you just don\u2019t see it that way, is that fair? Bill Brown : We see pricing pressure in the markets that we happen to be but keep in mind when you\u2019re deep with a particular service in a country those opportunities do tend to come back to you. We have incumbency in some markets. So when opportunities arise we tend to be at the front of the line for those kind of opportunities. We do have difficult pricing conversations with every one of our customers but I don\u2019t see it increasing measurably next year from where we were at this past year on the international side. Unidentified Analyst : And can you remind us of the 260 - 270 of R&D spend that you actually spent how much of that is directed at RF tactical in \u201914 and then how are you adjusting that specific spend in RF tactical in fiscal \u201915? Bill Brown : There is a fair amount of the -- about 260 to 265, you\u2019re very insightful on that number, it's in that range on internal R&D is spent at the RF Com business and the largest piece of that is within the tactical business. I think it's safe to say it's in the $100 million range but I don\u2019t think I want to get much more specific than that, it's a substantial amount of money. As we go into next year there maybe a slight increase in that and may come from other parts of the company as we see good returns and good investment opportunities in tactical radio. We may see some shift, some of the increase that we saw in Q4 comes with adding of people and those people carry into next year so there will be a natural increase next year just because of the annulization of some of the investment we made in Q4, not a 100% of it but some piece of it. So a very good chunk of our investment is being spent in the tactical business. I would also say you can see the resilience we have in the GCS business 0 to up 2% next year relatively strong this past year, we have stepped up our internal R&D spend at GCS as well and I think that\u2019s paying dividends as well. Unidentified Analyst : Just one last one, if you can just comment RF tactical assumptions for your foreign sales mix for fiscal \u201915 maybe between systems -- I think you\u2019ve given some flavor on the mix is the mix more beneficial in that side of the business in fiscal \u201915 than it was in \u201914? Thank you. Bill Brown : Yes we saw at the beginning of last year, we talked about this quite a bit because we expected it will provide a little bit of margin pressure that we would see substantial growth in the amount of systems we\u2019re selling into international market. We expected at that time that the systems business would roughly double year-over-year. It increased quite a bit, it didn\u2019t quite double it was up about 50%. And we see another increase going into next year of a substantial amount of the orders seemed relative a market magnitude of 40% more or less. This year, this past fiscal \u201914 it was around a $180 million to $200 million worth of systems business on the international side and it will go up in the 35% - 40% range next year. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Quilty with Raymond James. You may begin. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : Just want to follow-up on that FGCM Award, I know it's IDIQ but can you give us a sense of scale of the opportunity relative to your legacy program just order of magnitude how much big of an opportunity you see this has? Bill Brown : It's going to be substantial. We have done in the range of $30 million to $50 million a year with the NGA and my comments and I will just repeat them here that that business should double over the course of the next year or two. I think it remains the same Chris, so I think that\u2019s sort of shapes and sizes the opportunity at a pretty high level. Chris Quilty - Raymond James :  And just talking about the HMS program when you look at the upcoming NIEs, how well do you feel your positioned in terms of having hardware in the field and the testing environment at any new requirements that have been placed on you? Bill Brown : Frankly there has been a whole lot that\u2019s been happening on the -- in that particular area. We just came off a 14.2, I think our performance on 14.2 was quite good. We felt very, very good about it and I think we\u2019re well positioned in the upcoming NIEs. I think if you read and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve Chris, a lot of what\u2019s written in the press and memos by very senior people in the military about the performance of Program of Record in other parts. I think we feel very, very well positioned with our HMS offerings both the manpack and the Rifleman. We talked to you before about the advantages of our own manpack product. It weighs less, it's smaller, has all the waveforms, doesn\u2019t need all the expensive appliques, it boots up quicker all those various things and we feel very, very good about that and I think when I look at some of the comments coming out of the military based on 14.2 about weight, size, battery life, heat dissipation. I feel very good about where our product is going to stack-up based on our long legacy of developing products in this area. We developed our manpack product with an eye towards keeping the weight low, with an eye towards making it heat and thermally efficient. So we think that that is going to be a performance differentiator for us overtime. So I feel very good about our product offering both in what we did in 14.2 as well as what\u2019s coming up in fiscal \u201915 and I hope that answered your question Chris. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : It does and an update on the Rifleman? Bill Brown : The Rifleman is very -- we have got a great offering in the Rifleman radio, for us it's the U.S. equivalent to our international soldier radio. We sold 44,000 of those radios around the world and I like where we stack up there as well. We have got a product with a longer battery life in excess of 12 hours, shorter connect time to network and I think as you might have seen in the demo it has a unique dashboard display at the top providing operational network status. So battery life remaining, numbers of users on the net et cetera, it's NSA certified. So we feel very good about our Rifleman Radio product as well and I think over the last year-and-half you\u2019ve been asking us quite frequently about NSA sort on the manpack and I did mention in my prepared remarks we got that in June. So both the manpack and the Rifleman are bought NSA certified at this point. Chris Quilty - Raymond James :  And final question the announcement you had on the hosted payload on Next I think 63 million, if I remember your contract with Iridium was for something like 45 million so was there upside to the program in terms of the number or amount of hosted payload activity? Bill Brown : Yes substantially. It's Aireon is a program. It's a joint venture between NAV Canada and Iridium and our contract is really with Aireon and it's to put payloads on to this constellation and the total amount of payload I think it's 66 satellites on orbit with -- on orbit spares and on ground spares. So I think it's total of 81 and there is 81 payloads just for Aireon and on top of that there have been other payloads booked with other customers for that constellation and hopefully that answers your question Chris. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : So this is upside on the -- I think it was 15% of the payload that you had reserved for classified customer activity and the upside is on that portion of it. Bill Brown : I would just say that it is upside to what we anticipate it when we signed Aireon in terms of the payloads riding on that constellation. I think it's all that we can say. Pamela Padgett : All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett. And on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; and Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press release and on this teleconference and the related presentation, we will discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is included in the tables of our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of this call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Bill with that I'll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Okay. Thank you, Pam and good morning everybody. We began our fiscal year posting strong revenue and orders growth in government communications systems and in RF communications\u2019 international tactical radio business. Operating performance was solid as we continued to benefit from lower costs and good execution. Turning to Slides 3 and 4 of the presentation. Earnings-per-share was $1.18, flat with the prior year and favorably impacted by $0.06 from a lower tax rate in the quarter. Operational earnings came in as expected.  Revenue was down 3% with continued strong growth in government communications systems and in international tactical radios more than offset by continued weakness in the US tactical radio market and declining IT services revenue, primarily due to the wind-down of two major programs.  We remain focused on expanding outside the US, and in the first quarter, international revenue was up 15% to 31% of total revenue, trending favorably compared to 30% of total revenue for all of fiscal \u201914. While our focus on operational excellence is reading through the margins and earnings, some of the savings is being reinvested in R&D to drive future growth.  Company-funded R&D was up 5% to 5.4% of total revenue with essentially all of the increase in tactical radio. Orders in the quarter were $1.11 billion and book-to-bill was 0.96. Orders were down 7% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in IT services. Sequentially, orders were up 3% in the quarter. Turning to a few segment highlights, and I'll begin with government communications systems which had an excellent start to the year with revenue, orders and operating income, all up significantly over the prior year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year growth for GCS.  Customer diversification and leveraging our strong franchises in space, avionics, air traffic management, geospatial imagery and weather are creating new opportunities and producing excellent results in a tough government spending environment.  For several quarters we've highlighted the F-35 program as a revenue driver, a trend we expect to continue for number of years as the program continues to ramp, and as we look for opportunities to increase scope.  So let me give you a little color on the role that we play. Harris leveraged its track record of success on the F/A-18 and F-22 platforms into a larger role on the F-35 program, providing mission electronics, fiber-optic networks and power supplies. We also supply the antenna and interface unit for the Multifunction Advanced Data Link or MADL, providing stealth communications between F-35 aircraft.  Following fourth-quarter contract wins of $78 million for the F-35, in the first quarter we received another $22 million pushing contract awards to date to over $800 million. Under the current scope, total contract value could reach $4.5 billion over the life of the program and we've identified another $1.5 billion of opportunity for additional scope, including next-generation processors and expanded communications capabilities.  I will also mention that in GCS, our classified business continues to grow, and in Q1 we booked orders against a previously announced large win in geospatial imagery, the $770 million foundational geospatial content management contract or FGCM with the NGA. At the time of the announcement, there was a protest outstanding which we\u2019re happy to report was denied.  Now turning to RF communications. International tactical radio revenue and orders were significantly higher than in the prior year. As we indicated last quarter, opportunities in Iraq were firming up and we booked two orders totaling $99 million, adding to the $50 million booked in the fourth quarter. These three orders were from multiple end-users and are part of a broad set of requirements across the MoD and MoI, including various defense services in a number of national security organizations. And we continue to see large opportunities in Iraq in our 12 to 18 month pipeline and beyond, building upon our decade-long track record in that market.  International opportunities such as Iraq tend to be multiyear multiphase modernizations where customers typically standardize on an established technology like the Falcon III family radios, like we\u2019re seeing in a country in Asia where we booked an $18 million order in the quarter, bringing orders to date to $200 million. And in the Philippines where we booked an $18 million order in Q1, following a $14 million order booked in Q4.  In Canada, Harris was awarded a four-year $180 million Canadian single award IDIQ contract for Falcon III radios in support of several modernization efforts within the Canadian forces, including special operations. Canada has been a large user of Falcon II radios and a long-standing partner for 20 years. I'm pleased that the international 12 to 18 month pipeline remains strong at $2.5 billion, replenishing quickly following another excellent quarter of orders and revenue growth, pointing to continued progress on multiyear opportunities. In times of global conflict, our tactical radio business has historically benefited and we\u2019re beginning to see that in the quality of opportunities both within and beyond our pipeline.  Security concerns in the Middle East have no doubt heightened and the situation in Ukraine remains a significant concern, especially for Europe where we've seen opportunities increased a bit in size for Poland, and for the Baltic and Scandinavian countries as well as for Ukraine.  Coalition actions could also add to our opportunity list because of the need for interoperability. Since our radios have a broad installed base around the world, we\u2019re well-positioned to meet that requirement. In the Middle East, opportunities are not just within one or two countries but are broad with major opportunities in at least five countries and smaller but significant ones in a handful of others. And our Middle East customers, in the face of heightened security issues, are really looking at requirements to ensure their forces are adequately equipped with the right command, control and communications equipment. And typically in these countries we\u2019re considered a preferred supplier.  In the US tactical radio market, budget constraints and procurement delays continue to result in weak revenue and orders. The issue is not demand as customer requirements are real and they are significant. Our DoD pipeline remains roughly at about $1 billion and includes both modernization plans across the services as well as typical resets, upgrades, replacement, spares and support.  What\u2019s holding back the market is the uncertainty caused by the overhang of no government fiscal year \u201815 budget and the worry of sequestration on the horizon in \u201916. We believe spending should improve once a \u201815 budget is passed.  We\u2019re confident that US tactical radio modernizations will move forward and all the services are committed to it, including the Army whose modernization alone is a multibillion dollar opportunity. The Marines have standardized on Falcon technology and are steadily upgrading, and SOCOM released in October, an RFP for the multichannel handheld portion of a $500 million modernization effort called SOCOM Tactical Communications or STC program. STC encompasses a family of radios, the multichannel handheld, the multichannel Manpack and an HF wideband radio and is expected to have multiple suppliers and we fully expect to be one of them.  As our results today and over the last several quarters indicate, we\u2019re investing to win and we\u2019re demonstrating a readiness to deliver now. Following NSA certification, our new multichannel Manpack received it's official nomenclature, the AN/PRC-158, a sign of customer endorsement and intent to procure.  We've now booked orders with three different DoD customers outside of the Army and we expect shipments to begin this quarter. Relative to the Army program of record, our PRC-158 Manpack offers size, weight and power advantages and doesn't require add-on application to operate over the Mule satellite system. The team also uniquely designed an expansion slot into the radio, so the customer can tailor capability to the specific mission requirement.  A customer might choose to integrate an ISR feature such as access to direct UAV video downlinks, or add third-party modules for specialized ISR applications, or to add commercial SATCOM access. My point is that radios are not designed just to meet the spec. Instead we develop radios to meet the needs of the soldier with capabilities that oftentimes go beyond the spec.  And we\u2019re doing the same thing with our wideband rifleman team radio. To provide ourselves with an independent and real user view, the radio was tested by the Network Battle Lab for experimentation at the Cyber Center of Excellence and soldiers from the 15th Regimental Signal Brigade. The results validated the radio superior transmission range, shorter time to form a network from a cold start, and ease-of-use due to our unique dashboard display which simplifies mission planning and monitoring of network connectivity. Both radios will compete in the Army's upcoming Manpack and rifleman radio procurements.  And we continue to make great progress on the previously one mid-tier vehicular radio program called MNVR. Government integration testing for the MNVR radio started in mid-October and is a key milestone for the radio. Preliminary results leading up to the testing were very positive, demonstrating the ability to quickly form WNW and SRW networks. For both networks, the radios met data throughput requirements even while exceeding range requirements.  And in the spring, the limited user test will be at the focal point of NIE 15.2 which we hope results in a Milestone C decision to initiate for a production and begin deliveries in fiscal \u201916. And as I mentioned in the last call, we\u2019re developing a Mules upgrade solution to port into already fielded 117G radios, some 30,000 of them adding significant value to our customers\u2019 existing inventory. This upgrade market is anticipated to be significant with opportunities beginning in late fiscal \u201915. And before leaving RF communications, I will touch on public safety. The public safety market remains weak and is estimated to be down low double digits for the year to date calendar 2014. While local government budgets have improved and more than half of the market is still analog and eventually will be upgraded to the P25 digital standard, customers have been slow to move forward. We believe the wind-down from re-banding and narrow banding and some hesitancy in the front of the [ph] rollout of LTE is weighing on the market.  As we also see the market becoming increasingly more competitive, we\u2019re continuing to work on what we control : our cost structure, our product lineup and the effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities to improve our competitive position. And then finally in integrated network solutions, revenue was weak as expected for the segment but commercial CapRock and healthcare results were once again encouraging with both businesses posting revenue growth in the high single digits.  So with that, I will turn it over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance. Mick? Mick Lopez : Thank you, Bill and good morning to everyone. Moving to segment results on Slide 5. RF communications revenue was $387 million compared to $423 million in the prior year. Segment orders were $374 million, up 7% compared to last year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. Tactical communications revenue was $276 million and declined 9%. While orders were $288 million, up 28% compared to the prior year. We experienced strong revenue and orders growth in international but the US market remained weak. Book-to-bill for tactical was 1.04 and sequentially funded backlog was up modestly from 4Q\u2019s $564 million to $575 million this quarter.  The public safety, weakness in the state and local market continued. Revenue was $111 million, down 6% compared to the prior year. Orders were $86 million compared to $123 million in the prior year. Operating income for the RF communication segment was $117 million and operating margin was 30.1%. Let\u2019s turn to government communications system segment on Slide 6. First quarter revenue was $461 million, increasing 12% compared to $412 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from classified customers, commercially hosted payload programs, the F 35 program and the FAA's NexGen data comm program was partially offset by lower revenue from NASA's Space Network Ground Segment Sustainment program.  Segment operating income was $74 million and operating margin was 16%, reflecting manufacturing efficiencies in the space area and strong program performance across the segment. During the quarter, Harris was awarded a five-year $495 million ceiling multi-vendor IDIQ contract from the U.S. Air Force for the hosted payload solutions program and awards totaling $83 million from classified customers.  Turning to integrated network solution segment on Slide 7. First quarter revenue was $326 million, down 13% compared to the prior year. Revenue growth in commercial CapRock and healthcare was more than offset by revenue decline in the government market. Declining revenue in IT services was primarily due to the rolloff of NMCI contract, and the decision to no longer sell pass-through products on another contract, and to a lesser extent, from continued market weakness. Segment operating income was $23 million compared to $30 million last year. Operating margin was 7.1% compared to 7.9% in the prior year. These operating performance improvements at CapRock and healthcare were more than offset by the rolloff of the highly profitable NMCI contract.  In healthcare, the news was encouraging. The team released the latest version of the Fusion FX software solution, incorporating new features and interface enhancements such as graphical chart displays, multi-browser support and automation improvements. We had several new wins in healthcare, including a contract from Phoebe Putney Health System for our provider portal solution linking physicians and other clinicians throughout one of Georgia's largest health systems. We won two international contract awards; one from Telus Health in Canada and one from National Health Service-East Kent in the United Kingdom. Our software is now deployed at 50 hospitals and the number of users over the last quarter has grown from 50,000 to 75,000.  Let's turn to Slide 8. Our company generated free cash flow of $46 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. CapEx was $41 million compared to $33 million last year. We continue to expect free cash flow for the fiscal year up about a 100% of net income with CapEx up about $200 million. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow and in the first quarter increased our dividend by 12% and used $100 million in cash to repurchase 1.4 million shares.  Our effective tax rate was 28.7% as a result of a foreign tax credit settlement but we still expect a 32.5% tax rate for the full fiscal year.  Moving to Slide number 9. Fiscal 2015 guidance remains unchanged at a range of $4.75 to $5 per diluted share and a revenue decline of 1% to 3% compared to the prior year. Also, no changes were made to segment information which is detailed on this slide. With that, I\u2019d like to ask the operator to please open the lines for any question. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company : So hey, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, could you comment maybe on how the tactical RF orders have trended since the September quarter ended? And then if you could just give us some flavour of when \u2013 what you expected the bookings \u2013 what the cadence of RF tactical bookings will be through the year, because it looks like you do still have some go-get kind of business to hit the numbers this year? Bill Brown : Yeah, I don\u2019t think, Gautam, we can comment on anything that's happened since the close of the quarter at this point. We will release publicly whatever we believe should be issued in a press release as they get awarded to us, we will continue to do that through the second quarter. I would say we felt pretty good about the start to the year in international and we were very pleased with the revenue and order growth coming off a very very strong fiscal \u201914. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Gautam, I'm encouraged by the pipeline replenishing itself to you\u2019re seeing 2.5 billion and it\u2019s pretty constant over the last number of quarters, it almost looks like a manufactured number. In fact, there is real opportunities, they\u2019re moving through the pipeline and the fact that we\u2019ve been booking so healthily, including in Q1, I am pretty encouraged by that. And I would say also in terms of the quality of the opportunities as they\u2019re moving through the pipeline feels pretty good.  On the domestic side, we knew the first half was going to be a bit challenging. We talked about that in the last quarter. We knew we\u2019d have a slow start. We did see some opportunities that we had hoped to book in Q1, slipped a little bit to the right. The fact is we\u2019re operating under a CR. We expect that will get resolved towards the end of the calendar year and a budget happening sometime early in next calendar year as something that happened this past year. So I think once that happens, I think money will start to flow once there is more certainty on funding lines. So we do expect the back half in the DoD tactical business to be a bit better than the front half. But I think it's what I can comment on in terms of the order trajectory as we see it today, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company : And you are still looking for it to be down, tactical RF, low single digits, is that right \u2013 so there is no change \u2013 Bill Brown : Yes, there is no change to that. We still see the year down low single digits. We still see the DoD part down the low double digits in the 10% to 12% range, and again we start out Q1 a weaker than that, so it does imply a little bit better performance in the back half. We do see international up low single-digits and again we start out a little stronger than that. So perhaps a strength there might offset a little bit of softness in DoD but overall tactical for the year we still see it being down low single digits. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company : And can you update us on your buyback plans for the year? I think you said 200 million but you did just over half of that in Q1. What do you expect to do in terms of share buyback? Bill Brown : Nothing has changed at this point. We\u2019re still guiding towards $200 million for the year. We tend not to communicate too much on a quarterly pattern here. Last year we did start off the year as well with a pretty healthy buyback in the first quarter. We ended up doing more in the year. This year we did $100 million in Q1 and still guide to $200 million for the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan: Bill, just on the cash flow, you were a little lighter in the quarter than you haven\u2019t had below 100 million for a while in operating cash flow in a quarter. Just wondering, it looks like some of it was inventories. Wonder if you could comment on maybe where things were a little weaker in the quarter and were you looking for a pick up later in the year? Bill Brown : Well, I think I would say that Mick and I weren\u2019t too particularly happy with our start on free cash flow. As you point out, we typically have done better in the first half of the year. Our first half is always a little weak and Q1 is always a weaker part of the first half. But we were down quite a bit versus last year. We\u2019re not pleased with the results. It wasn\u2019t in any particular segment, it was really across the segments and it wasn\u2019t so much capital. Capital was up a little bit in the quarter as we knew it would be. It was really coming off of working capital. We know we booked a couple of orders a little later in the quarter than we thought, so that didn\u2019t get collected and we built a little bit of inventory and we are going live this quarter on a ERP system in RF in Rochester and we want to make sure we\u2019re protected for that. So there is a bit of inventory there but we\u2019re going to hit a 100% in net income for the year, we\u2019re guiding to it. I am confident on our ability to get there. We know what we need to do and it will correct itself through the year. Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan: Is it fair to say that in tactical that \u2013 or even in RF more broadly that Q2 should look sort of like Q1 and you expect a material pickup going into Q3 and Q4, or maybe a little help with that \u2013 [indiscernible] would be because you are under 400 in the quarter, backlog is pretty consistent with where it was and \u2013 it looks like Q1 you\u2019re 800, looking for 1.8 for the year. So any comments there? Bill Brown : Well, we\u2019re not going to guide to Q2. I mean we\u2019re going to stick to the guidance for the year. What I did say earlier, in fact, is consistent with what we said on the last call, was that the second half was going to be bit better than the first half. And I think a lot of this is going to do with -- have to do with some budget certainty which we see happening. We did see the tactical backlog come up sequentially a little bit a couple percent and that\u2019s encouraging for us. We do see typically 60% to 70% of our backlog turned in the year. We do see up to 75% of new orders that we book in the year to convert to revenue within the year. That's spot on to what we did in fiscal \u201814 and we see fiscal \u201815 playing out pretty much the same way. Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan: And then just one more, any thoughts \u2013 I haven\u2019t turned this one on in a little while but any thoughts on capital deployment outside of returning cash to shareholders, i.e. M&A, any pipeline, just any update in the strategy there? Bill Brown : Well, we wouldn\u2019t talk about anything in particular on M&A but I would say that there's nothing in the marketplace where Harris right now is changing our strategy. We remain committed as the board does to returning capital to owners in an efficient way. We continue to fund internal priority and that's our number one requirement. We've paid a nice dividend, you probably saw we raised it again 12% in the month of August. We\u2019ve got a very strong track record of double-digit increases going back a decade 23% CAGR was pretty pretty healthy. And it has been up by about 19%, 20% the last three years. We\u2019ve been I think pretty good in returning cash in terms of buyback as well, and as my comment to Gautam indicated, we still have 200 for the year, 100 million in Q1. We come out of the gates a little soft on free cash flow but I'm sure we will hit on a percent of net income in the full-year. So nothing has really changed at this point, that's notable to report to our owners. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: Just a couple of quick ones. First off, on your comments around PSPC, I know last quarter, Bill, you had said you expected things to tick up a little bit more in the back half of the year but it sounds like incrementally the commentary there -- that market is a bit tougher than you thought coming into the year. And am I hearing that correctly -- hopes of the pickup in the back year of your fiscal year? Bill Brown : Yes, it is incrementally a little bit softer than we had hoped. We thought the market would accelerate towards the back end of calendar \u201814 and at least through our calendar \u201913, so our first quarter, we didn't see that happening. As I mentioned last time, there is a combination of both the market being soft and continued to be soft, I think we\u2019re in a bit of the trough between the narrow banding, rebanding rolloff and LTE somewhere off in the horizon and the market is getting a bit more competitive. And we\u2019ve got some internal execution issues that we\u2019re working through. We've put in place a new management team. We\u2019re working hard on our sales force. We\u2019re making a lot of improvements to our product offering. We are working on some of the nagging quality issues we have seen over the last couple of years in our business that the team is really focused on. And we get almost daily reports on how we are improving on the quality side. So it\u2019s really the combination of those two things. And in order to hit \u2013 so we start off the year, fiscal year a little bit softer than we had hoped. We\u2019re still guiding to flat for the full-year but that does put a bit of scratch in the back half. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: And then with respect to INS, I wondered if you\u2019d just give us a little bit of color. The language in the release makes it sound like the year-over-year decline was basically the IT services pieces you talked about, which would sort of suggest that the domestic declines or government declines in CapRock were offsetting the growth in commercial. Is that the right characterization and can you help us understand some of the color around the declines and the growth there and just some more color on what you are seeing in that marketplace? Bill Brown : I think it's accurate, Carter. I think the challenge we had in INS in Q1 was almost as we had expected and guided to. So the segment as a whole came in as we had thought it would. IT services and the rest of the government part of INS was soft. We did see the rolloff of two significant contracts in the IT services business. One was NMCI that Mick had mentioned, the other is the NETCENTS products business which we decided to not sell under anymore because we didn't think it added any value to our owners. That's about two-thirds of the impact in IT services and the other third was about \u2013 it was really around the market softness in IT services.  We did continue to see some erosion on the government side of CapRock, you know, that business was down about 24%, 25% last year. It was pretty soft as well in Q1 and that was not quite offset by as we mentioned some growth in the commercial side of CapRock which was very good both in maritime and energy as well as in the commercial side of healthcare. So it didn\u2019t offset the decline from the government side but it did mute them a little bit. Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays: And just lastly with respect to the \u2013 I understand this can be a Q1 sort of thing but you're obviously running very good margins in government comm in the quarter with INS perhaps a little bit below kind of full year expectations. Are those suggestive of any trends, does it imply anything about the guidance moving, or is it just Q1 and it\u2019s too early to call? Bill Brown : It's too early to call but yes, we did see GCS a little bit better than what we were guiding to for the year. We knew that was going to end up happening and we knew the margins were going to be strong. We knew we had a couple of space programs that are more product related that are going to wind down after Q1. So we don\u2019t really see that repeating in Q2 but we\u2019re very very pleased with where GCS has been in a market that's really very very challenging, to come out with 12% growth top line and pretty strong orders is very impressive accomplishment of the team. And like I said on the INS side, yeah, it\u2019s a little bit soft, not as we expected the softness in the first quarter but today we don't see any change in the guidance for the full-year for GCS or INS. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Peter Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton : Bill, I was wondering \u2013 do you have a sense that maybe your Army radio revenue is kind of at a trough this year. I know it should be down but now for a number of years it seems like the comp is just getting easier for you in terms of QD [ph] volumes, particularly in the Army, because you\u2019ve got a number of competition, it seemed like you\u2019re pretty well placed. On the other hand, the Army budgets are really tough. So I am just wondering how you think about things from that perspective? Bill Brown : Well, look, we certainly see the business to be \u2013 continue to be challenging in our fiscal \u201915, it\u2019s where we\u2019re guiding to be down, another 10% to 12% from being down north of 20% last year. And so we know there\u2019s going to be more pressure in the budgets in fiscal \u201915. However they are constituted in and get approved in December January timeframe. But look, we see the budgets bottoming. We may not be at the bottom or certainly near it, we do know that with a modestly better budget environment we do see budgets starting to recover and support for modernization happening in fiscal \u201916. So we do see that getting better over the next year or two. It's hard to say that this is exactly the inflection point but I think we\u2019re bumping along the bottom.  I think the demand is there, it\u2019s driven by a number of factors. Certainly Army modernization is important. I am glad to see it\u2019s still a priority, the opportunity over the next decade is multimillions of dollars, could be $5 billion. We do know that some of the delays in HMS do create some fill the gaps that we hope we can find a way to plug. I'm very pleased that SOCOM has come out with their STC program, the modernization program that was come out as an RFP in October and the rest to follow, that's a half a billion dollar program, we\u2019re well-positioned there. We do know that there are some reset opportunities that are OEM funded because there is a lot of inventory of radios and they need to be upgraded and reset. There is some urgent needs requirements. There's a lot of conflict in the world, that perhaps there are some urgent needs that are happening. I am finding a lot more attention paid to Mules [ph] and frankly a little more concern around SATCOM access, and SATCOM reliability which is partly why we\u2019re seeing a little more interest in a wideband radio, wideband HF radio. So to me there's a number of things that could cause the business to get better over time. I do see that when the markets do come back, when the funding is there, the investments that we've made and they are significant ones, are going to position us to be successful. So long way of saying, Pete, I think we\u2019re sort of bouncing along the bottom and recoveries can depend upon what happens in the overall budget environment. Peter Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton : I will just have one more follow-up. Hosted payloads, you are on a couple of contracts now, it\u2019s kind of a new area. Just wondering how you think about this area, maybe how big you think it could be because like I said, you have a couple of new contracts but there is a lot of competition also, at least on one of them. So I am just wondering if you see this as kind of a long term trend and if it\u2019s kind of a meaningful opportunity for you, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 maybe a more modest one? Bill Brown : Well, I think we\u2019re very very well positioned and it started a couple of years ago when we won the Arianne hosted payload for the [Arianne radium] set of satellites that they\u2019re going to launch I think some time next year. And that put us in the leadership position and we were able to augment that win with a number of other payloads on that platform. And I would say today we are the market leader on hosted payloads and I think we\u2019re well-positioned. We've got a facility set up in Palm Bay under GCS. We\u2019ve got a lot of years of experience in doing this sort of work, and the us winning a piece like many others on this hosted payloads solutions contract is very encouraging to us. We\u2019re looking at six or seven different opportunities that are live, under that particular contract. And I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 I think we\u2019re going to be very well positioned over time. I do think that this is a longer-term trend, this has to do a lot with what people call this disaggregation of space where very large multibillion dollar single-purpose satellites will likely over time get disaggregated into smaller pieces, that could be more responsive, launched faster, be more nimble than waiting for a decade to have a very large exquisite multibillion dollar satellite launch. I think the needs of our military and IC community, and the technology progress is such that it\u2019s to me that's the direction that this whole market is going to go. It doesn't mean that there won't be a demand for exquisite technology, I just think that there is a lot of opportunity for finding hosted solutions on ready to be launched commercial platforms. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Quilty of Raymond James. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : Bill, can you give us -- is there any update on the timing of RFPs for the rifleman Manpack are still on track? Bill Brown : Well the latest we\u2019ve heard is the rifleman RFP should be out in the next couple of months by the end of the year and probably the Manpack perhaps early in calendar \u201915 like in the January timeframe. I am sort of \u2013 that\u2019s good [ph] to call in the ball, on this one, Chris, to be honest with you. That\u2019s the latest we are hearing from the PEO and so I am repeating that to you but it does feel like it is getting lots -- it's right around the corner. There has been a lot of discussion, RFI discussion on both the rifleman and the Manpack going back and forth. And it certainly does feel like we\u2019re getting a lot closer to the RFPs being issued. So that's the perspective as we speak today, Chris. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : And I haven't read through all the commentary on the RFIs. But was there anything in the original specs or the RFI discussions that\u2019s troubling in terms of product designer requirements? Bill Brown : No, I wouldn\u2019t say there's anything that we\u2019re finding particularly troubling. I think the RFIs on the Manpack really go back to what happened in NIE 14.2 where the program of record perhaps did meet the expectations of the Army, this followed with this memo from General McMaster who at the time was the commanding general of the Army Maneuver Center of Excellence, like in the June timeframe he was pretty critical of the program. And I think what the Army has done has gone back and reassessed their needs, their requirements and the RFIs that we've responded to are more along the lines of addressing some of the concerns on size, weight, power, range, heat, that General McMaster pointed out and it's asking questions relative to what sort of improvements would you be able to make over what period of time in the Manpack. I think it's you being used to inform the Army as to what might be a special requirement and what might be an objective requirement.  I find it all to be honest with you very very encouraging for Harris, because what they're looking at is how will these product be improved over the near-term to do those things that General McMaster wants to see happen -- take weight out of it, make it more nimble, improve the range, reduce the power draw, improve battery life. Those are some of the things that we do every single day going back over a decade and we continue to make improvements on our radio. We think today even our Manpack is very very well positioned. I made a few comments on that in my prepared remarks. I think our radio is well-positioned. We've got great ideas to do some additional things, bring additional value, like this additional slot that the team just put into the Manpack radio of that lot capability should the warfighter need that additional capability for ISR or SATCOM access, that\u2019s pretty interesting and unique, and it\u2019s gotten the services kind of interested and excited about that. So that's the progress that\u2019s happening right now. So I do believe when the RFPs, when they come out over the next couple of months, I think we\u2019re going to be very well-positioned. I am extraordinarily encouraged that we have three orders outside of the Army are ready and we are delivering in this quarter and I think that really to me is a testament to the fact that we\u2019re ready to compete for the Army program. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : Speaking of orders outside \u2013 if I did the numbers correct, it looks like your international opportunity pipeline went from about 2.4 to 1.5 billion, are those numbers correct? And can you just speak to that? Bill Brown : Now the international pipeline has remained about $2.5 billion for the last several quarters, it\u2019s very very good, very strong. And as I mentioned in some of my remarks, I think the quality of pipeline is good if not coming up a little bit. It hasn't changed in its size over the last couple of quarters despite really really good bookings here, Chris. Chris Quilty - Raymond James : And with the FTCM contract, can you just speak to -- I mean with series of contract awards now, how much incremental all of that order activity has been relative to your past work that you\u2019ve done in recent years? Bill Brown : Yeah, no change to what I mentioned on the last call. We have a long history with the NGA as a key geospatial imagery supplier and that broad set of suppliers is narrowing itself down to today \u2013 to really being two and we won two of three regions around the world. As I mentioned one of the regions was protested, it was denied. So we have 2 of 3 regions around the world for the NGA. Task orders are starting to be issued against those contracts, and as I mentioned last we expect the value of that business for us, for Harris Corporation, to roughly double in size from where we were. And we were in that $30 million to $50 million range, maybe $50 million, we think that that's going to double over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Sterne Agee. Josh Sullivan - Sterne Agee : So just with the rebates, managing price in the last month or so, are your CapRock energy customers making any change to their long term CapEx investments? Bill Brown : We haven\u2019t seen that, I think it's too soon to say and I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with the commentary that I am reading across all the other players in the energy segment. At $80 a barrel whatever it is today, 80, 81, something like that, it hasn't hit that level which causes people to rethink capital investments. Should it fall another $10, $15 I mean maybe something is going to change. I think it\u2019s going to end up happening and then impacting some of the big oil and gas players a lot sooner than it will impact us. So we have not seen that.  Remember our model here in CapRock, these rigs are existing, they are very long \u2013 the new ones are long-term build, you got to get positioned on them very very early on. We tend to own the equipment, we lease it back to the operator of the rig. So should oil prices remain deeply depressed for a multiyear basis would there be an impact on the business? It's possible but it won\u2019t read through to us for some time. Josh Sullivan - Sterne Agee : And then can you just talk about the Smart Sky opportunity and if there is any overlap on the LTE capability to public safety? Bill Brown : Yeah it\u2019s a little bit too soon to talk about Smart Sky for us, we do think it's an interesting opportunity for us for developing some good technology based on GCS for air to ground communications. And it builds on the things that we do at public safety but also in LTE capability we have around the company and it is really being led by GCS. A lot of it has to do with our ability to develop and deliver long-range radios. We do it for the military and this is a slightly different adaptation of that. So nothing to really update today. It's still a work-in-process. Operator : Thank you. I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Pamela Padgett for closing remarks. Pamela Padgett : Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference call is Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin ma'am. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our call today to discuss Harris\u2019 second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings, as well as our intended acquisition of Exelis that we announced earlier this morning. I'm Pamela Padgett and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Dave Melcher CEO and President of Exelis. Before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Including regarding the acquisition we announced today. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press releases and on this teleconference and the related presentations, we will discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures in respect of our second fiscal 2015 financial results is included on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, which is www.harris.com. A replay of the call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. And with that Bill I will turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Okay, very good. Thank you Pam and good morning everyone. I want to start by expressing our deepest condolences on behalf of Harris to the family and friends of Joe Nadol an analyst who has followed Harris for almost a decade, and who tragically passed away earlier this week. So today we are announcing a transformational acquisition of Harris that will create significant and lasting value for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. With the acquisition of Exelis we are increasing our scale, broadening our technology base and expanding our customer set in markets where we had decades of successful performance. So before jumping into the transaction, Mick and I will briefly cover second quarter results and updated Harris guidance and then Dave shall walk you through the acquisition before opening the call for questions. So turning to our second quarter earnings presentation Slides 3 and 4, Harris performed well in the second quarter with earnings per share of $1.32. Operating results were solid reflecting good execution and lower cost. Earnings per share also benefited from lower than expected taxes including the 2014 R&D tax credit. Revenue for the Company was down 1% with growth in Government Communications Systems, International Tactical Radios and Commercial CapRock more than offset by continued weakness in U.S. Tactical Radios and by the previously reported wind down of two major IT services programs. International revenue was up 5% in the quarter and was 31% of total revenue, and the strategy of expanding already strong franchises within the government market is providing revenue strength for the Company. So touching briefly on the segments, Government Communications Systems posted its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and generated excellent operating income, demonstrating yet again the strength of its core franchise in Space and Intelligence, Avionics, Air Traffic Management, Geospatial Imagery and Weather. In the area of Avionics the F-35 program was a major revenue driver in the quarter and we also received a $60 million follow-on contract for the LRIP-9. In Air Traffic Management where we've had a longstanding relationship with the FAA and recently expanded it with more than $900 million in awards over the last three years, we were awarded a 10 year $98 million follow-on contract for OASIS II that supports flight services in Alaska by integrating real time weather and flight planning information. Our strong franchise in Space and Intelligence have also been rich with expansion opportunities. Classified programs were a revenue driver in the second quarter and following the close of the quarter, we had two strategic classified wins, a three year $23 million contract from a new customer for space situation awareness and support of air force missions, and a five year $300 million single award IDIQ contract to integrate the governments various intelligence systems. In our Space business, we introduced two new space reflector products, a first-to-market five meter unfurlable Ka-band antenna serving a growing market for high throughput satellites and a new lightweight fixed-mesh reflector where we also won our first order. In RF Communications the International Tactical Radio business continued to show strength with higher revenue, good orders and solid opportunities firming up in our $2.5 billion opportunity pipeline. We signed a $101 million follow-on contract with a country in Africa and expect to begin booking orders against it late in the fiscal year, and we have visibility into several FMS orders in the pipeline that are moving fairly quickly towards award. Australia's tactical modernization continues and in the second quarter we booked a $38 million order for Wideband, Handheld the Manpack radios for the Special Forces bringing orders to-date to $560 million with an additional opportunity of about $90 million on the horizon. This latest award positions Harris very well as the future provider on Y-band radios for a fully networked architecture of the Australian defense force. In Iraq in the second quarter we shipped a significant portion of the $99 million in orders booked in Q1 and additional requirements and opportunities were added to the pipeline. There was $1.6 billion authorized in GFY15, for the Iraq train and equipped fund and another $1.3 billion into President's budget request for 2016 that will support significant opportunities for Harris making Iraq one of the larger components in our near-term tactical pipeline. Also in the quarter, we received a $50 million order from a nation in the Middle East for an integrated country-wide tactical communications system based on its Falcon III Y-band radios. This nation represents a new Special Forces customer for us in the Middle East and the award further strengthens our preferred supplier position in the region. As expected, the U.S. tactical radio market remains constrained but I am encouraged by the recent pickup in procurement activity. The RFP for rifleman radio was finally released and these are due next week, and the final IDIQ contract is now much bigger than we had previously anticipated. $3.9 billion over 10 years with $1.4 billion for the rifleman itself and 2.5 billion for objective requirements like a two channel handheld radio, way forms and vehicle adapters. We submitted a bid for the $390 million next-gen handheld portion of the SOCOM Tactical Communications modernization effort, which will be followed over the coming months with RFPs for Y-band HF and multichannel Manpack radios. We now believe that the total SOCOM modernization opportunity could reach $900 million. Also in the quarter we submitted a bid for an Air Force IDIQ contract to integrate infield battle management capabilities. Before leaving tactical I\u2019ll make a few comments on the President\u2019s budget request. In the tactical lines that support our business we saw some pickup in GFY16 across the marines, navy, air force and SOCOM so at least beginning move in the right direction. For army modernization MNVR funding is higher over the five year period than in the previous year\u2019s budget, reflecting the program\u2019s good progress towards production. For HMS funding was $65 million for GFY16 which for us was a positive surprise given they are still sitting on about $300 million in unspent funds and since the procurement has been pushed out to GFY17. In the out years for HMS the budget matches the procurement schedule with funding picking up in GFY17 to $291 million and rising to $470 million annually in \u201918 and out. In public safety revenue was weak in the second quarter and competitive pressures remain intense. Our execution is slowly progressing and will more evident as the market improves. Process improvements in all the key areas are resulting in better program execution, lower cost, a more effective salesforce and positive customer feedback on new product releases. We have made measurable progress but we still have a lot more to do. In Integrated Network Solutions, revenue was about as expected with high single-digit growth in CapRock, more than offset by the wind down of two IT services programs. Commercial CapRock revenue was up 15% driven by our previous Carnival cruise-line win, and we had a particularly quarter in energy despite the market turmoil with revenue up 8% and orders up 23%. In healthcare solutions we continue to receive positive feedback from customers on our Fusion FX software solution and we are making progress in our efforts to find a partner for the business with better domain expertise and channels to market. We also recently decided to eliminate the INS headquarters\u2019 function to reduce indirect expenses at the segment level with Sheldon Fox, President of Government Communications Systems, named as the acting President of INS. This move also better aligns our CapRock business with GCS where we know we have significant technology sharing opportunities that can help us bring more differentiated solution to CapRock customers. Now I will turn it over to Mick to comment on guidance, Mick? Mick Lopez : Thank you much Bill, and good morning to everyone. We have included our typical segment detail and financial highlights in Slides 5 to 8. But instead of reading them in the interest of time I will go directly to Slide 9 for our updated fiscal 2015 outlook. We are increasing our fiscal \u201915 earnings per share guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.05 per share from previous range of $4.75 to $5 per share. Revenue guidance remains unchanged and is expected to decline 1% to 3%. Our guidance doesn\u2019t consider the acquisition being announced today. In RF communications we have narrowed the guidance range, and expect revenue to be flat to down 2%. Within the segment we expect public safety to be weaker offset by higher international tactical. U.S. tactical expectations are unchanged. A bit stronger back half revenue compared to the first half due to the passing of a GFY15 budget and timing of funds flowing down to customers. In Government Communications Systems we now expect revenue to be up 2% to 4% and operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.5% and that\u2019s a little bit better than before. We expect modest sequential revenue growth in the back half. In Integrated Network Solutions, first half revenue was generally in line with expectations. Strength in Commercial CapRock more than offset by program wind downs and IT services, while IT services are showing signs of bottoming we are no longer expecting any pickup in second half revenue and we are assuming that revenue pressure in the CapRock energy market materializes due to the impact of lower oil prices. As a result we now expect fiscal \u201915 revenue to be down about 10% and operating margin up about 7%. We are still expecting free cash flow of about 100% of net income and a full year tax rate between 30.5% to 31% which translates into an average tax rate of about 33.8% in the back half, about half of the decrease in tax rate guidance is due to calendar 2014 R&D tax credit and the remainder from other favorable tax items. With that I'll now turn it over back to Bill to comment on the acquisition. Bill Brown : Okay, well thank you Mick. And as Pam mentioned earlier I am joined here in the room by Dave Melcher, President and CEO of Exelis, who will offer a couple of comments as well. So let me turn now to the separate acquisition deck and I'll begin on Slide 3. This acquisition brings together two engineering driven companies with similar cultures that value technology and innovation to solve some of our customers' toughest mission-critical challenges. The combined pro forma company has LTM revenue of $8.2 billion and EBITDA of about $1.6 billion. This powerful combination creates an industry innovator with much greater scale providing a broad spectrum of technology-based advanced communications solutions. Let me start by providing a high level overview of Exelis and reviewing the transaction details before diving a bit more into the strategic rationale. So now turning to Slide 4, Exelis has a number of leading positions across diverse markets. Electronic systems which is about 29% of company revenue is a leader in electronic warfare technologies for the air force and navy. The principle strengths are in electronic protection and onboard processing on platforms such as the P8, the B52 the C130, the Apache helicopter and the international F-16. Exelis' flagship product is the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures or IDECM for the F-18 a multibillion dollar decades long program with about 400 systems delivered to-date. About 21% of the Company is geospatial systems, a leader in space and airborne sensing. Exelis is well known for their world class space imaging business acquired about a decade ago from Codec, the weather sensors as well as your GPS technology. The imaging business has traditionally served the intelligence community but is more recently expanded to include commercial, international and unmanned vehicle payloads. Their products range from a 21 foot wide mirror on the James Webb Telescope, down to small commercial payloads for the World View and GOI satellites. They provide the Gorgon Stare wide area surveillance ponds for defense UAVs and have recently launched Corvus Eye a smaller commercial version targeting the public safety, international markets demonstrating Exelis' skill in translating government technology to the commercial world. Exelis' weather payloads have been on all NOAA weather satellites launched since 1978. The CrIS or the Cross Track Infrared Sounder is a primary instrument on the joint polar satellite system and ABI or the Advanced Baseline Imager is the main mission sensor on GOES-R. ABI has also been selected as the main mission sensor for Japan's Himawari and South Korea's GEO Comsat two-way weather satellite. In GPS Exelis has been on all U.S. GPS navigation systems ever launched and is currently delivering the first payloads for the GPS3 program. Information Systems is about 34% of the Company and provides full life cycle mission critical solutions for customers like NASA, where Exelis manages two of NASA's largest communications contracts and the FAA, where Exelis owns and operates the ADS-B network a core element of the FAAs next-gen program. Night-vision in tactical communications represents about 13% of company revenue. Exelis has been the industry leader in night vision for over 50 years and is one of only two U.S. manufacturers of image intensification tubes. And their tactical communications business has a large installed base of more than 600,000 radios. The remaining 3% of Exelis provides composite aero-structures for commercial and military aircraft. They have 10,000 employees including about 3,000 engineers, $3.25 billion in revenue and funded backlog of about $2.8 billion. So turning to Slide 5 on the transaction details, total purchase price is $4.75 billion at 23.75 per share, 70% in cash, 30% in Harris shares. Bridge financing is in place and we anticipate a combination of term loans and new bonds to both finance the acquisition debt and refinance parts of existing Harris and Exelis debt at what are historically low interest rates. Pro forma net leverage will be about 2.9 times net-debt to adjusted-EBITDA at closing with significant pre-payable debt and the opportunity to rapidly deleverage. This structure provides balance sheet flexibility and preserves our ability to invest for growth while we reduce net leverage to about 1.5 times by year three. Of course this is subject to approval by Exelis shareholders as well as customary regulatory approval and we expect the transaction to close in June of this year. On Slide 6, as you may know, Exelis has a very large pension liability relating to the legacy ITT business with an unfunded liability of $1.9 billion at the end of 2014. Current historically low interest rates should provide a strong positive bias to net under funding overtime. We have done significant due diligence work with specialist outside advisers and with a high-level of government cash reimbursements and the smoothing that is allowed in the recent MAP-21 legislation, pension funding requirements are clear and fully factored into our thinking. On a pro forma basis pension liability as a percent of market cap is well in line with defense peers. Turning to Slide 7, this is a highly strategic and compelling combination that generates significant value for our customers. The complementarity between the two company\u2019s technology and capabilities strengthens our core franchises and provides optionality for portfolio shaping. It also builds a stronger platform for growth and immediately creates significant scale and more balanced earnings for Harris. Cost synergies are meaningful and the timing of the transaction is excellent given the confluence of an improving budget environment, low interest rates and a team with the background and the experience to successfully integrate the two companies. So let me say a few words about each in turn. Now turning to Slide 8, we bring together complimentary technologies and capabilities that strengthen our core franchise in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems, air-traffic management and tactical communications. On a pro forma basis our classified business is about $1 billion in size with significant growth potential. For example by combining Exelis\u2019 world-class electro-optical technology with our market leading RF capability we will be able to offer responsive multi-mission solutions to the intelligence community. In weather, our tighter linkage between Exelis\u2019 on-orbit sensors and Harris\u2019s ground processing capabilities can help customers increase performance, lower cost and improve time to market for new weather systems. By having increased access to unique data sets, we can accelerate apportion to value-added services and predictive analytics. In air-traffic management Exelis is strong in surveillance, while Harris is the leader in communications and the combined company will be the prime contract on four key FAA next-gen programs. And finally our combined tactical communications businesses will drive significant scale efficiencies across our supply chain and our manufacturing assets. But the combination also provides a stronger platform for growth. And on Slide 9 we highlight a few examples, leveraging our complimentary international channels, pairing our world-leading radios Exelis\u2019 night vision offering and putting our avionics onto Exelis\u2019 existing platforms and then finally accelerating growth in value-added services in geospatial, weather and airport operations. So moving to Slide 10, this acquisition creates scale and improves our competitive position in the government market and also results in a more balanced earnings profile for Harris. In Slide 11 our diligence work has been thorough and we are confident we can achieve run rate cost synergies of $100 million to $120 million net of what is returned to customers through cost plus contracts and fixed price contracts that periodically reset. The breakdown of savings is roughly one-third from consolidating headquarters eliminating public company cost, one-third from operational improvements like manufacturing, supply chain and program efficiencies and one-third from functional efficiencies and overheard reductions. The cash payback is under two years. Now turning to Slide 12, transaction value was $4.75 billion a multiple of 9.3 times 2014 EBITDA. We expect GAAP EPS to be slightly accretive in the first year and a significant contributor thereafter with free cash flow approaching $1 billion in year four. And then finally on Slide 13, the timing for such a transformational acquisition is excellent, both internally and externally. Over the last three years since joining the company we've focused on improving fundamentals and shaping our portfolio. And in the face of a constrained government budget and declining revenue environment we aggressively addressed our cost structure by taking restricting actions and establishing a formal companywide operational excellence program. Our Harris business excellence program is now in its third year and it\u2019s embedded in our culture, and the management team stands ready to integrate the two companies to achieve our cost synergy targets. A full time senior level integration team is being assembled from the best of both companies, and includes my direct oversight. The timing is also excellent from an external point of view, the U.S. government spending cycle has bottomed and recent world events only stress the importance of defense and national security spending. The President's DOD base budget for fiscal '16 is up about 8% and even under sequestration is up modestly with steady growth in the out years. Interest rates are at historical lows and we estimate that our pro forma cost of debt will be about 200 basis points below where Harris is today with a weighted average time to maturity of an additional two years. So as we enter an improving macro-environment our combined company becomes a strong platform for top-line growth with our lower cost structure and greater operating leverage driving excellent earnings growth. Now before opening the line for questions I'd like to turn to Dave for his perspective on the transaction. Dave? Dave Melcher : Thanks Bill and good morning to everyone. We at Exelis are very excited about this unique opportunity to bring these two great and complementary companies together. The combined enterprise is very well positioned to be more competitive in the marketplace and will benefit shareholders, customers and our employees. This transaction provides immediate value to Exelis shareholders as well as long-term upside potential from the equity ownership stake in Harris. We've made a lot of progress since the ITT spin to focus the company and we built a strong leadership team with talented and dedicated employees. I am confident about the long-term prospects of the Exelis businesses and even more optimistic about the future ahead of us in combination with Harris. This is indeed an exciting day for us all. And with that I'll turn it back to Bill. Bill Brown : Thank you very much Dave. Let's open the call to questions. Question-and: Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Carter Copeland : Just a couple of questions, one Harris specific and then one about the transaction, first off the comment about the CapRock guidance planning on weakness materializing there in the back half of the year because of oil and gas. Can you just help us quantify what kind of decline your, I guess I would say protecting for there? And then just with respect to the transaction maybe for Bill and for Dave. When you look at the customer and channel overlaps and the comments you made about them being complementary. If you could kind of rank order, what some of those are and what you think the best opportunities in various end markets, if they're space or if they are commercial and commercial communications? Any color there I think would be helpful. Thank you. Bill Brown : On CapRock, in the last call I commented a bit on the impact of oil prices at the time oil price was sitting around $75 a barrel plus or minus and we had not yet seen really anything running into our financials, we ended up having a very strong second quarter as I mentioned with orders very strong and revenue up solidly in energy double-digit. We feel pretty good about that, but with oil sitting today below 50 we're seeing a little more pressure coming in the half, it's coming in more in the form of pricing, we've quite a few long-term contracts in CapRock. But even under long-term contracts we will see, we do expect to see some pricing pressure and that\u2019s going to pressure margins, it\u2019s going to pressure top-line growth as well. So we have accommodated for that in our new earnings guidance for INS, and this is why we sort of sized of being revenue down about 10%. Mick did you want to offer any more on CapRock in the back half? Mick Lopez : Yes, so what I would like to note is that it\u2019s all relative, we were expecting some growth in the back half and now it\u2019s more stable more than anything so it\u2019s growth typically. Bill Brown : And on the transaction, I would say a couple of words about this and maybe ask Dave to jump in as well, but. Look as we looked at the mix of the portfolios here there is quite a lot of complementarity in the spaces that I talked it. In space, in traffic management, surely in the weather franchise we both are in the tactical radio business have been there for quite some time, and we do see a lot of opportunities to work together in the international market through the channels that we happen to have as I mentioned about perhaps providing some products through the pretty strong existing Exelis international sales channels. And I am very excited about the opportunities in value-added services taking some of the capabilities and unique data sets that come out of the sensors that we have and packaging them in a way that we can sell to a very large fragmented by growing quickly value-added services market. Frankly here Exelis is out ahead of us. They have got a very sizable business in this area, they have made a few acquisitions in this space, and we have started we have been working on this for a year or two our team down at GCS and I think the combination of what they have done and the capabilities that we bring I am pretty excited about the growth trajectory in value-added services, Dave anything to offer? Dave Melcher : Yes, no I think we are both very excited about is that if this combination offers a full suite of capabilities across space, airborne, naval, ground and cyber domains, and with a number of leading positions in each of those. I echo Bill\u2019s comment with respect to the international sales, we both have different products that we sell around the world and now we have a much more expansive international network in which to sell those capabilities. And I agree with the integrated end-to-end solutions comment for sensing communications, information process, and analysis and distribution. So, I really like the fact that the leadership positions that we have with organizations like NASA, FAA and our communications customers will only be enhanced by this deal. Operator : Our next question comes from Howard Rubel, Jefferies. Howard Rubel : If you wouldn\u2019t mind either Bill or Dave kind of talk for a couple of minutes on some of the deal metrics and I have sort of one or two questions and if you could help that would be appreciated. First, you talk about some of the cash investment cost, did you include in that some of the refinancing in there? And then second, if I am thinking about the cost of funds based on sort of where rates are today and I know they can move, we are looking is a 4% kind of range a reasonable number? And then last related to that, while you have some terrific synergies you also have from the GAAP perspective my guess would be some either amortization or some intangibles and some of that\u2019s going to be frankly non-cash so there is some real benefit there that GAAP will mask and it will also create some tax shelters. If you wouldn\u2019t mind sort of providing a little bit of structure to that I would really appreciate it? Bill Brown : It\u2019s a quite a mouthful Howard, thank you. And I am going to start I think got most of the points but perhaps between Mick and I will hit your points and if we miss one let\u2019s keep going on with that. So in terms of the structure we expect we will close in June. So there are going to be a number of transaction-based costs that will hit in June and will be impacting our fiscal \u201915. As we go into fiscal \u201916 we do see the transaction to be slightly accretive. We do expect that of course while the Exelis EBIT coming in, in our fiscal \u201916 so that\u2019s going to be a positive. We see integration cost which are going to be a little bit more front-end loaded, in fact a lot more front-end loaded, hitting fiscal \u201916 and there will be more than the savings we get from integration. We do see in the first full fiscal year some benefit from the pickup of unamortized pension losses that we know exist at Exelis and it's going to be offset by deal amortization which will be substantial and that will be in fiscal '16. So all of those pieces come together and we do see a very slight accretion in our fiscal '16 again hinging on a close in June should that move into July there about our fiscal '16 of course would be impacted by that. You asked the question about the cost of borrowing about 4% we do expected to be lower than that and we were thinking Mick on our weighted average basis it will be sort of between 3 and 4 about 3.5%, so Mick, any other comments Mick on that? Mick Lopez : Yes, absolutely. I think in FY15 we will have refinancing cost which are not included but we will also incur some deal costs, some financing fees, and a little bit of restructuring. Moving on to the cost of funds the way we hope to finance this as alluded beforehand is 30% of equity and 70% of debt we're taking the opportunity to refinance some of our short-term debt and in order to have rapid prepayment about half of our debt is going to be within five years and more than half of that would be term loans that which are very easily prepay. So, the cost of debt for the company will go down as we alluded to about 200 basis points that will be at or about or below 3.5% though. Bill Brown : So, Howard did I hit all the comments or the questions that you asked? Howard Rubel : More or less I mean I just think the thing that is striking and very impressive is that the cash of synergies overtime are going to be very strong and it is very complementary I mean if anything my observation is I was slightly higher but I guess you want to be start out conservative but no Bill this is great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Peter Skibitski : And I'd echo Carter\u2019s comments about Joe and I guess though first question on the pro-forma of free cash flow approaching 1 billion in year four, just wonder what kind of top-line assumption you're factoring into to get to that? Bill Brown : We do see that the business together will start to grow on the top-line probably in fiscal '16 more likely in fiscal '17 or still we sort of put together our plan we're not giving guidance today on fiscal '16 but I think all indications are for top-line growth but frankly when you just look at the free cash generation of our combined companies today, you look at the cash contributions which are more smooth going in the future for Exelis associated with the pension and then the cash return from synergies being generated by year four, we do see ourselves approaching about $1 billion in free cash. And that is also looking at there will be probably some opportunities in capital spending since we do have very complementary businesses, it's very likely we'll have some opportunities to take a hard look at how we each spend capital and look for opportunities as well. So all those pieces together Pete come together to drive us about $1 billion in about four years. Peter Skibitski : And then just on the, I must have missed your comments about the cash investment cost of 130 million to 150 million, so those aren\u2019t transaction cost, those are restructuring cost maybe or something else? Bill Brown : That's correct, they're synergy cost, investments to capture synergies and again I want to be very clear, those investment costs and the savings on that chart are net of what we would be working with our government customer on. So that is what is accruing to our shareholders. Peter Skibitski : And then I guess my last question just I mean obviously you guys are one of the few companies in the industry to kind of utilize the commercial pricing model and I was wondering if you had any thoughts as you were looking at this deal surrounding, an opportunity to take your commercial pricing model to certain of Exelis\u2019 products or is that just not applicable? Bill Brown : Well, I think we on our commercial pricing model or commercial model at Harris is mostly in our RF business and I think when you look at the NVCS business from Exelis it follows a largely the same model, I think on the rest of Exelis it looks more like what we see at GCS which is sort of more typically government type, permanent record type programming. So, I think that's what I think would look very similar from that perspective Pete. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I wanted to ask if you could just help quantify what you anticipate the intangibles amortization to be, because this deal actually does look a heck a lot of more accretive at first flash than you are indicating. So I am trying to understand if you could quantify intangibles maybe some of the other items that we are not thinking about in year one and two? Bill Brown : Yes look maybe just a little bit more color, I mean we just -- we are announcing it today, we have got a lot of work here to do to sharpening the numbers and we will do that between now and closing, provides you a little bit more guidance as we understand the pieces quite a bit more. I would say of the total investment it\u2019s going to be more front-end loaded, it will be more in fiscal \u201916 sort of on the order of two-thirds will come up in the first year then it will flow down in the second year maybe a third with little trickling into the second year and then a little more trickling into the third year. We see the intangible amortization to be in the range of about $130 million to $140 million is our estimate today. We do see savings starting to flow in, in fiscal \u201916 but as I mentioned integrated cost will be higher than the savings and then it starts to flip as you get into fiscal \u201917, so more savings than cost and you start to hit more run rate into fiscal \u201918 where cost of integration are relatively low. I think those are the major pieces that I think I could probably comment on here today, Mick anything? Mick Lopez : A couple of accounting nuances, first and foremost just based on the latest 10-Q Exelis has about $24 million in intangible amortization per annum and the purchase accounting that will go away so the 130 is that we mentioned before here 130 to 140 is what we will incur. So you have to take into account when you combine both firms. And then also of import in their pension they have a net of converted actuarial loss which with purchase accounting also goes way and you can calculate that. I think the last reported number for that was $2.3 billion as of the end of \u201913 and the amortization of that is in the range of around $80 million to $100 million per year. Gautam Khanna : Okay, so that\u2019s 80 million to 100 million of sort of additive to the P&L or\u2026 Mick Lopez : Probably on the lower-end of that, yes. Gautam Khanna : Okay, so the EBIT that you guys are assuming from Exelis is an excess of the $400 million or so that they report, is that what you are suggesting, to be clear? Pamela Padgett : Yes. Gautam Khanna : And then with respect to the cash investment cost on Slide 11 that is specifically for what? If you could just give, is it the three buckets that you talked about on the left there? Or is that inclusive of other deal costs that you haven\u2019t called out. Bill Brown : Yes we should be very clear about that, it really refers to what\u2019s on the left. There are no deal costs that are in the 130 to 150, those are investments that specifically yield a return or savings of synergy. Gautam Khanna : And so what order of magnitude are we talking about with the deal cost you have yet to quantify? Bill Brown : I think we are going to maybe sort of use that as an opportunity to communicate a little further down the path to investors on what that happens to be at this point Gautam. They are going to be in our fiscal \u201915, we will come back to you and others over the coming weeks with a little bit more shape around what those costs happen to be. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Sterne Agee. Josh Sullivan : Just given the move with the INS headquarters and now with the Exelis assets, are there other areas in the legacy portfolio such as healthcare which may not be as strategic going forward. I think you might have mentioned portfolio optionality? Bill Brown : Yes, well clearly when you take the two combined companies and put them together, we will take a hard look as we have done and I know Dave has done in his portfolios to the strategy and the strategic rationale of holding on to assets. Of course we will have a broader look across our broader portfolio and we will continue to do what we each have one individually on the broader portfolio, that\u2019s not our near-term focus certainly our near-term focus right now is on getting from sign to close, closing the deal, launching integration, making sure of a successful post-merger integration period. And that\u2019s what we are laser focused on at the moment. Clearly there is going to be a realignment of the way we are organized in this transaction and what we've decided to do with the INS headquarters is a relative to what Harris was doing standalone but also relative to what we're preparing ourselves to do in a close. So it's completely along that same direction and that's as far I would comment today on any portfolio shaping. Josh Sullivan : And then maybe just I have other question, what\u2019s the DOD\u2019s position just on M&A transactions such as these right now? Bill Brown : Well look I think our defense customers in fact all of our customers are going to be excited about this transaction I think they're very interested in a vibrant stable industrial base, they're interested in enterprises that invest in innovation and technology and we've demonstrated a willingness and ability to do that, they are interested in innovation but affordable innovation and they'll be sharing in the savings associated with the consolidation of these companies. They're stimulating competition in the industrial base and I think we'll be a more competitive franchise. So in my belief all of our customers including our defense customers will be quite excited about the transaction. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : On the business if I look at RF on the top line for the remainder of the year, it looks like you have to have a pretty nice acceleration going from a revenue decline to revenue growth there. And the comps aren't much easier when comparing to last year and order of momentum is a little bit stagnant. So can you maybe just talk about what's picking up in the back half within RF? Bill Brown : We do see a little bit of a softer public safety outlook, we do see DOD strengthening a little bit, because there is a budget and there is flow down of funding, we see that picking up and we're seeing a lot more activity on the DOD side, but frankly we're very encouraged by the strength and resilience of our international tactical pipeline, it\u2019s strong, remains about $2.5 billion even when we continue to book orders it continues to refresh quickly. I have talked at some length about what's in it and the prospects on the horizon, a lot of activity is moving in the pipeline and we feel very good about what's happening in the back half in international tactical radio. So today we see international tactical up a little bit more than we thought a quarter ago offsetting a little bit of the softness we see in public safety. Our DOD outlook for the year really hasn\u2019t changed since we started the year. So what kind of full year international growth rate are you looking for now? Noah Poponak : So what kind of full year international growth rate are you looking for now? Bill Brown : I don\u2019t think we're going to talk about sort of the international business tactical on a standalone basis. But we do see that to be up. Last time we were saying it's up low single-digits it\u2019s probably up a little more than that like mid to high single-digits in that range. As last time we said DOD was going to be down low double-digit, it's about the same sort of -- as I mentioned them before down 10% to 12% so that hasn't changed. PSPC where we thought it was flat is more of down mid single-digit. So hopefully that characterizes a bit more how we see the full year in RF. Noah Poponak : And then kind of the same question on the margin in the segment, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what was weaker in the quarter and then to get into the range for the full year of the back half has to pickup pretty nicely versus the trend of kind of ongoing pressure we've seen there, so what drives that in the back half? Bill Brown : Yes and that is a good question, I mean look overall we\u2019ve been pretty consistent at that margin guidance for the year in RF business 30% to 31%. In the first half we're a little light we're at 29.5% roughly for the first half, came in at around 29 in Q2. In Q2 we had some adverse mix we had a lot of systems business, we had some additional R&D expenses that rolled through in the quarter in Q2. And I have been very-very clear on these calls about our willingness to invest more in our RF business, particularly in tactical radios and you've seen those investments flowing through. And of course in Q2 we had given the volume slightly lower margins in public safety than we had anticipated earlier in the year, the second half is going to get stronger because we will see much stronger product mix coming through the business and we feel very confident that will come in at between 30% and 31% on a full year basis. Noah Poponak : And then could you similarly update us on the pieces of INS for the full year in terms of a growth rate in the IT services business and in CapRock? Mick Lopez : What we're seeing in these businesses as particularly in HITS on a year-to-year basis, they've lost two major -- wind down of two major programs we know about the NMCI and so that is a significant year-on-year. When I look at the revenue for HITS what you'll find is declined in low double-digits but the commercial is continuing to do well. On healthcare it continues to grow year-on-year and all-in-all it's up macro environments right, we're having energy issues, oil prices are affecting that. Noah Poponak : And then if I can just ask one more on the transaction, could you guys talk a little bit about what your diligence found on the ADSB program over at Exelis, seems like a large long opportunity but also seems like the type of thing that can take longer than expected or kind of easily slide to the right and so I was just curious how you were thinking about that program? Bill Brown : Well, I'm not going to go into specifics on what we found in diligence I think Dave and his team have talked a lot about the strength with the FAA, the maturity of the ADSB program and the confidence that the administrator has placed in ADSB, the commitment to it, the drive and the mandate on equipage by 2020 holding firm on that and we feel good as I think Dave and his team feel about ADSB, it's a great program, they're performing very-very well. I think the FAA is very pleased and it's going to fit very nicely with the things that we do today with the FAA as you know we were on the FTI program we've been on that for 15 to 20 years we have been envy the next-generation voice switch program as well as datacom, so I think the programs that we work on with FAA and the strong reputation we've there with the FAA is going to be augmented by the very strong reputation that Exelis enjoys on ADSB with the FAA as well so I think we feel very good overall with our position there. Pamela Padgett : Okay, I appreciate it. I think it wraps us up for today. Thank you everyone for joining us and let me know how I can help you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call maybe recorded. And now I would like to turn the call over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am you may begin. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings. I'm Pamela Padgett and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO and Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, Management may make forward-looking statements. Including regarding the acquisition we announced today. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and a discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, our press releases and on this teleconference and the related presentations, we will discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures in respect of our third quarter fiscal 2015 financial results is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of the call will also be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that Bill, I will turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Okay, well, thank you Pam and good morning. Our third quarter results were in line with our preliminary release issued April 21, which opened our debt financing window for the Exelis acquisition. We've very successful bond offering and we're making progress towards an expected June closing and we'll discuss this further later in the call. So before turning to Slides three and four of the presentation, I'll point out that we're now reporting on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to call our acquisition related cost separately. In my comments today, it will around non-GAAP performance which excludes acquisition cost. Third quarter earnings per share was $1.32 and benefitted from a lower than expected tax rate that added $0.07 per share. Earnings per share also reflected good operating performance benefitting from lower cost, excellent execution and a favorable product mix in RF Communications and government communication systems. Operating margin was 100 basis points higher than in the prior year even with higher R&D investment, which was up 8% in the quarter with some of the increase due to timing between the third and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, R&D investment is 5.6% of total revenue with a significant portion being spent in the Tactical Radio business where we're aggressively developing product offerings for upcoming army and SOCOM modernization procurements. Revenue for the company was $1.19 billion, down 6% with Tactical revenue growth more than offset by further weakness in public safety and a significant decline in integrated network solution, primarily from the wind down of two major programs in IT services. As anticipated, revenue also declined in government communication systems, largely due to a tough prior year compare related to revenue from commercially hosted satellite payloads. Orders in the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% over the prior year and up 9% sequentially. Both RF Communications and government communication orders were up sequentially. Tactical Communications revenue was up 6% on continued international strength and some improvement in the U.S. market. Procurement activity picked up in March and April as GFY15 procurement dollars were allocated to our DoD customers including SOCOM where we received orders totaling $27 million to continue expanding their Wideband networking capability. And momentum continues to build for U.S. Tactical modernization. Just last week, Harris was awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the rifleman radio with an $800,000 initial order for qualification and test units. The army expects to begin fielding rifleman before the end of GFY17. The army also recently kicked off their long awaited procurement for the Manpack. A draft RFP was released in April and was quickly followed up by an industry day as well as the first quarterly tactical networking form, which had intended to provide the industry with greater insight into the army\u2019s upcoming procurement requirements. The final RFP is anticipated before the end of September with an awarded 2Q GFY16 and full rate production slated to begin in 4Q GFY17. Preliminary information from the army indicates a 10-year multi-award IDIQ contract with the ceiling value between $12 billion and $12.7 billion. And at SOCOM, last quarter we submitted our bid on a $390 million handheld portion of SOCOM\u2019s modernization program with an award anticipated in September and just a few days ago, SOCOM issued an RFI for their Manpack, which we currently expect will be awarded in the Spring of 2016. The total SOCOM modernization procurement, which will eventually include a high-frequency radio, could reach $900 million. Now winning rifleman radio on top of the mid-Tier MNVR radio a few years back and now having major procurement underway for both the army Manpack and SOCOM is the culmination of a multi-year, multi-pronged effort for Harris. Over the last several years we worked hard to ensure army procurements are open to commercial competition and then more recently pushed for multi-vendor versus a single vendor award to ensure a level playing field with the program of record. We invested more in IRAD when the rest of the industry was investing less raising R&D spend by more than 20% through the downturn and today we sealed with one of the best lineups of Tactical products and technologies than we\u2019ve ever had. And with modernization procurements now underway and larger than anticipated, Harris is well positioned to capture a significant multi-billion dollar opportunity. We also see continued strength in the international Tactical market where our business is now twice the size of our U.S. Tactical business. Recent orders include $25 million and $60 million from two NATO countries, highlighting our broad installed base around the world allowed us to be more competitive in supplying radios to allied countries where inoperability is a critical element for collation actions. We also received orders of $22 million and $47 million from two countries in the Middle East and from a country in Africa, we received $15 million in the quarter plus $74 million following the close of the quarter through the next phase of modernization bringing orders to-date to $486 million. The international market is healthy and our opportunity pipeline remains solid at $2.5 billion and continues to replenish quickly. In Government Communication Systems, we continue to build on our strong position with the FAA and received our third major next gen award and in the year $238 million single award IDIQ for the Common Support Service Weather Program to design and implement a system to provide real-time weather information across the National Airspace System. Also from the FAA we booked $146 million in follow-on orders under our long standing FTI program only provide the ultra reliable network backbone of the U.S. air traffic control system connecting 4500 different sites across the country. Our DoD business within GCS continues to ramp with F35 and our strong intelligent franchise provides a platform for future growth. New classified contract wins in the quarter totaled $133 million including a three year $23 million contract from a new customer for space, situation awareness and support of air force mission. And also in the Intelligence area, Harris was awarded a five-year $300 million single vendor IDIQ contract to integrate various intelligence systems. Now I\u2019ll turn over to Mick to comment on segment results and guidance before providing an update on the pending Exelis acquisition. Mick? Mick Lopez : Thank you Bill and good morning everyone. Moving to segment results on Slide 5, RF Communications orders were $395 million, $393 million compared to $405 million in the prior year and revenue was $451 million compared to $457 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $356 million, an increase of 6%. All orders were $286 million and about flat from prior year of $285 million. In public safety, market softness and intense competitive pressures continued. Orders were $107 million, compared to $120 million in the prior year and revenue was $95 million compared to $122 million last year. Operating income for RF Communications was $151 million and operating margin was a strong 33.5% as a result of favorable mix primarily in international and from lower cost. Turning to Government Communications Systems on Slide 6, third quarter revenue was $455 million, down 5% compared to $477 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the U.S. Navy\u2019s Commercial Broadband Satellite Program and the NGAs Foundation GEOINT Content Management Program was more than offset by lower revenue from space customers and from NOAA\u2019s those are weather program that\u2019s transitioned to an integration and test space. Segment operating income was $75 million and operating margin was 16.4% reflecting strong program performance and favorable product mix. Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on Slide 7, third quarter revenue was $299 million, compared to $348 million in the prior year with the decline primarily due to the roll off of two large programs in IT services. Operating income was $12 million compared to $21 million last year primarily due to the wind down of the highly profitable and MCI contract. During the quarter, IT services was awarded a 10-year $450 million single award IDIQ from the Defense Information Systems Agency to provide systems engineering and program management services the crisis management system for CMS, a secured video and voice communications network for senior US government officials. This award extends our 30-year relationship supplying this critical component of our national security infrastructure. Also in IT services, we were awarded a position on the $960 million multi-award IDIQ contract for network-centric solutions to application services. In CapRock we strengthened our relationships with two longstanding energy customers. In the quarter we received a $35 million order from a major offshore oil and gas pillar for four-year extension of services across their fleet and two orders totaling $21 million from a leading energy services company extending services across United States and International locations. Turning to Slide 8, the company generated free cash flow of $150 million up from the prior year's $120 million as a result of lower CapEx with the completion of GCSS new engineering facility. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.9% in the quarter lower than previously expected due to favorable 2014 tax settlement. As announced on April 21, the increased fiscal 2015 guidance for non-GAAP income from continuing operations per diluted share from a range of $4.95 to $5.05 to a range of $5 to $5.10 and updated revenue guidance from a decline in a range of 1% to 3% to an expected decline of about 4%. Fiscal 2015 non-GAAP guidance does not include any impact from pending acquisition of Exelis. GAAP results will include potential post closing revenue and income from Exelis, increased share count from the transaction and acquisition-related cost that are expected to be in the range of $270 million to $290 million including a $125 million in estimated may whole cost associated with the refinancing of Harris debt. In RF Communications, to reflect further weakness in public safety we now anticipate revenue to be down 3% to 4% and expect to be at the higher end of our previous operating margin guidance of 30% to 31%. In Government Communication Systems, revenue guidance is unchanged that's up 2% to 4% of operating margin slightly higher in the range of 15.5% to 16%. In integrated network solutions, revenues now expected to be down 14% to 15% to reflect no improvement in the slow procurement environment for IT services and an incrementally softer outlook at CapRock due to impact of lower oil prices on the energy market and to a lesser extent in healthcare due to a slower revenue ramp. We now expect fiscal '15 operating margin of about 6%. Expectations for free cash flow aren\u2019t changed at about 100% of non-GAAP net income. The tax rate is now expected to be 30%, which adds $0.05 per earnings per share for the full year. Back to you Bill. Bill Brown : Okay. Thank you, Mick. When we began fiscal 2015, we anticipated that the constrained budget environment and slow procurement would create some revenue challenges. In Government Communication Systems where we're on a path to revenue growth for the fiscal year, our strategy of expanding already strong franchise helped overcome government budget constraints. In RF Communications, strength in international tactical markets has continued and we have a healthy set of opportunities and while it's premature to call a bottom to the U.S. tactical market, we\u2019re seeing the back half improvement we expected and the momentum building on the large DOD monetization procurements is encouraging. In both Government Communication Systems and RF Communications bottom line performance is excellent. So while we see positive indicators in our two largest businesses, our revenue challenge in the fiscal '15 have been greater than anticipated in public safety, in an integrated network solutions. In public safety the market is soft and competition is aggressive. We\u2019re focused on recovery and making measurable improvements in quality and execution and we continue to build our Leadership Team and invest in new products. This quarter, we introduced our new XG15 portable radio, which extends our full suite of product offerings and provides public service workers with P25 capability at a competitive price. We\u2019ll continue to focus on execution and delivering innovative products for our customers, which we believe ultimately bear fruit as the market improves. In CapRock while orders were up 24% with energy orders up 27% in the quarter, we now expect first half revenue growth to turn into a revenue decline in the back half. Our customers are reacting to the persistently low oil prices and taking actions today that even they didn't contemplate just a few months ago. We\u2019re responding by not only working to lower cost, but to also provide technology that will improve the competitiveness and stickiness of our managed communications offering. In 3Q, we launched what we call CapRock One a multiband antenna and software that transparently switches between C, KU and KA bands to provide the most optimal and cost effective transport medium and is getting great response in the marketplace. The acquisition Exelis builds on the stronger parts of Harris is an exciting, transformative new chapter for the company. We've now secured debt financing for the acquisition and at very favorable terms, which we've outlined on Slide 10. A $1.3 billion variable rate term loan is in place, which provides us a path for quickly deleveraging post acquisition and we recently issued $2.4 billion in bonds, a portion of which will fund our redemption of $750 million in existing higher coupon Harris notes to take advantage of low interest rates and to extend maturity. The $2.4 billion in new bonds are at a weighted average coupon of about 3.7%. As anticipated, we significantly reduced our weighted average cost of debt including the variable rate terms loans to about 3.5%, 240 basis points below our previously weighted average cost of 5.9% and with two years longer time to maturity. We now expect year one net interest expense of $180 million, to $190 million and our balance sheet will retain ample liquidity with about $300 million of remaining cash on hand at an existing revolver of $1 billion. While we received a second request from the Department of Justice, we don\u2019t expect any trust clearance to require the divestiture of any business or asset. The request for additional information is related to intellectual property needed to update the inscription in Singar\u2019s radios to meet an NSA 2024 requirement for secret communication. The army is considering whether to upgrade the encryption capabilities of these older radios and much of the information requested is intended to help determine if the army has all the intellectual property it would need to enable other companies to compete for that encryption modification work. We anticipate resolving these concerns promptly. The Exelis shareholder vote has been set for May 22 and we continue to expect the transaction to close in June. Integration planning is well underway with a full time, highly experienced team led by Sheldon Fox, Group President of Government Communications Systems. Sheldon is a 31-year veteran of the Government market with deep experience in key areas where Exelis and Harris have complementary businesses such as in space and intelligence, advanced weather systems and air-traffic management and of course I am personally deeply involved and will spend a significant amount of my time over the next several years to ensure we capture the full value of this acquisition. Since announcing the acquisition the additional work we've done has only given us more confidence in delivering the previously estimated savings of $100 million to $120 million, which you'll remember is net of what flows back through to our government customers. We're working hard to accelerate synergy capture and be at a running start on day on following the close. And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the lines for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Copeland of Barclays. You may begin. Carter Copeland : Hey good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Good morning. Carter Copeland : Just a couple of quick ones, first on the CapRock decline I know last quarter you had sort of outlined that you were protecting for weakness in that market, but not really knowing how to size it just yet, but obviously we're a quarter on now. What sort of declines are you expecting now at this point and do you think you'll hit a sort of run rate decline by the end of the year that levels off and how should we think about how much of that is price versus volume and is there any EBIT related impact from unsold bandwidth you can't sell on some of the current contracts right now. How should we think about the weakness there? Bill Brown : Let me sort of describe what's happening at CapRock and then come back to your question about the bandwidth unsold piece of bandwidth. I think we had a really good start to the year frankly in the CapRock business. Revenue in the first half was up driven in the 3% or 4% range double-digit low double-digits on the commercial side. Somewhat weak on the Government side, but overall 3%, 4% in the first half. And we\u2019re pretty pleased with what's happening in the Maritime space and frankly in the energy side the orders in the last two quarters were quite good and surprisingly good, up about 25% in Q2 and again a little bit better than in Q3. We do see revenue deteriorating sequentially and year-over-year in the third quarter and we expect that to continue Carter into the fourth quarter as well. It will be down probably double digits in the fourth quarter on the energy side. We do see CapRock as a whole being flat to down for the year and down in the back half. With oil that\u2019s now sitting in the $50 to $60 per barrel range, I think customers today continue to react quite aggressive to what\u2019s happening in the global oil market to try and anticipate where pricing is going to be. They're taking very, very aggressive actions and like I said in my remarks somewhat unpredictable where we were and what they were going to do back in early part of February. They were doing a lot of restricting. Capital spending is coming down. They're parking and may be scarping some rigs. They're lying the awards and acceptance of new rigs and that\u2019s certainly having a pretty big impact on our business. When we look at what\u2019s happening in this downturn versus last several downturns in this global oil market we see rig count down about 30% by the end of March. I would say we\u2019ll be on half way through the downturns so we do expect further erosion. We do expect it's going to carry in '16 and be a tough '16 for us. We think the road here is going to be slow in terms stabilization and the long recovery, but I would say for CapRock as a whole, recall we've talked about size of energy business at about $400 million. So it's about 8% of total Harris as we speak today even smaller when we combine it with Exelis. So it's not a big part of the company, but we do expect further pressure in the fourth quarter in the next year on, on the energy side and that\u2019s going to drag down CapRock. Now in terms of the bandwidth, fortunately we do see quite aggressive growth in the Maritime space typically in the cruise industry and that's offsetting some of the pressure that we\u2019re seeing in the energy space and some of the bandwidth that procure for the energy side. Carter Copeland : So you think this will be -- you find the bottom both revenue and margin terms there in fiscal '16. Bill Brown : We're not going to call '16 yet, but we do see '16 being softer than we\u2019re seeing right in '15 Carter. Carter Copeland : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up just to switch gears quickly on the Exelis synergies you briefly mentioned, you talked about accelerating the synergy capture there on the $100 million to $120 million. Now that you had couple extra months to go through this, do you think there is upside to that number over time or any color in the work you\u2019ve done in identifying and kind of sizing those opportunities? Bill Brown : No Carter, no more color today. We still feel very comfortable at that $100 million to $120 million by year three net of what\u2019s going to be flowed back to our government customers. We\u2019re working hard at it and we\u2019re doing a lot of pre-closed planning independently on our own with some outside advisors at key root type approach. We do expect to be running that at closing and we want to pull forward as much as we can. But no more color today working right now and it\u2019s getting to a close. Carter Copeland : Great. Thanks a lot, Bill. Bill Brown : You bet, Carter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Noah Poponak : Hi good morning everyone. Bill Brown : Hey good morning. Pamela Padgett : Good morning. Noah Poponak : Bill, can you just go back to that detail you\u2019re providing on the second DoJ request and it sounds like they\u2019re thinking about a technology upgrade and checking if they have a certain amount of IP. I guess what would happen if they did want to do that and they didn\u2019t have enough IP like can you maybe just give us a little bit more detail on how concerning those two or not? Bill Brown : I can\u2019t really give a lot more detail on this call. There has been as you would expect, there is active conversations going on with the DoJ. And this could go in a variety of different ways, I think couple of things, I would say and not to just reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. But I think the good news is that it is narrowly contained in the Tactical Radios side, it specifically relates to IP and ownership rights for IP. It does not and we don\u2019t believe it will require any divestiture of businesses or assets. So we think we can get our arms around the concern this issue relatively quickly and we\u2019re working and providing the DoJ the necessary information that they require to work through and resolve this question that they happen to have. We\u2019ll have more to say over the coming weeks as we take this issue forward to DoJ. But nothing I can\u2019t really speculate on what the outcome or solution maybe on this call. Noah Poponak : So they just require you to give IP to the army could it be that simple? Bill Brown : There could be a variety of responses, we certainly that could be one, but there is I won\u2019t even speculate as to where they want to go in terms of addressing their particular question given that it\u2019s a very active conversation that\u2019s happening today with the DoJ. I think I could provide anymore color to that, Noah. Noah Poponak : Okay. In the legacy business with when we look at before you\u2019re layering in some of the new business you\u2019re winning in the domestic Tactical Radios market with DOD, how do we think about how much of what you have today, you\u2019ll still have two, three, four years down the road when you\u2019re also layering in all of those new business versus how much of what you have today is replaced by that new business? Bill Brown : No they\u2019re certainly going to be some replacement of current business, but I think it\u2019s on the margin frankly it is going to happen over a long period of time, Noah. Please keep in mind that all the radios that are today in DOD inventory, it\u2019s less than 10% maybe 5%, 6% that are Y-band capable. So I think it\u2019s a long-term path to replace all of those Narrowband radios with Wideband radios and I think that\u2019s going to happen over multiple years not multiple quarters. Noah Poponak : Got it. And then anything you can tell us about rifleman I guess terms of trade in your bid and how we can think about margins on new business revenue compared to the current margins at Harris? Bill Brown : Even though I really like the position that we\u2019re in today it\u2019s something that didn\u2019t happened over night, it happened over multiple years in both ensuring competition was -- it was open to competition, we can compete for those procurement dollars that we invested in radio that met the requirement was in some ways more advanced than we\u2019re program of record was the time in which it caused some change in the competitive landscape for the rifleman radio. We are bidding on commercial terms, it\u2019s a competitive procurement, it looks much the same as what happened on the social program number of years back, where it was IDIQ shoot-out between us and Tallis on task orders. It was completely commercial. Initial awards for rifleman for going to be LPTA Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable and over time there will be some best value type opportunities for us. What\u2019s interesting is that the ceiling value is quite high at about $3.9 billion and in the rifleman the RFP it was both the single channel rifleman but also they say two channel handheld over time and how that gets clicked and when that\u2019s being brought in is still all to be determined. So I like our position, I like our scale, I like the advantage our technology brings. I like the fact that our commercial model allows us continue to invest to advance our technology and compete with whatever we have and our margins today on the handheld look great and it\u2019s even after competing with players around the world on this switch program. So I can\u2019t like what we have in the outlook for our business both top line and bottom line. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thanks a lot. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. You may begin. Pete Skibitski : Good morning guys. Nice quarter. Bill Brown : Thanks Pete. Pete Skibitski : Hey Bill you sort of anticipated my question on U.S. DOD radio volume and whether or not, we were kind of at trough in fiscal 2015. The volumes have come down quite a bit, you won rifleman, you mentioned MNVR, what else are you kind of looking for to kind of seem at the trough. I mentioned SOCOM win, if you could get that would help quite a bit but are you worrying about the CR next year, what else is kind of going into your thinking? Bill Brown : Well we feel really good about we\u2019re happy frankly in just the fact that the rifleman IDIQ was awarded last week and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever heard me saying sooner than we expected, when I talk about government contracting and it was sooner than we expected by a number of months and that\u2019s because of the changes that happened in the industrial base for the rifleman radio I believe. And it came in a lot higher than we thought in and it\u2019s encouraging to see Manpack moving forward, it\u2019s encouraging to see the SOCOM monetization moving forward in an RFI out last week for the Manpack part of SOCOM. So we starting to see some movement here and as I said in my remarks it is up to call to bottom and we\u2019re seeing both sequentially and year-over-year improvement in the second half and we expected that would have happened at the beginning of the year. If you look at the budgets, there is still lot going on in the see the outlook I think it looks good for us. It\u2019s improving a little bit, we\u2019re looking what\u2019s happening coming out of the house from services. We see what the mark up is that with last week I guess, was it really last week. We showed the base at the BCI cap but a substantial amount of OCO funding in total at $585 billion in line with the President happens to be in did it follows the way we have seen past years in terms of how that budget flows down to Tactical Radio line items. I think if it follows that, it will follow where the President happens to be and if President put in a budget for showed good funding, good funding growth on the MNVR product, good funding growth on HMS and good funding increases in the other services and I think that\u2019s quite encouraging. For the HMS, which is the rifleman in the Manpack there is a lot of unspent fund still available and if you look at the ramp, it ramps relatively quickly over the next two to three years to close $0.5 billion a year against in the President\u2019s budget. You know couple of years, which I think is quite encouraging, so you put the fact that the Army is moving forward with the budget. Next to the fact that the funding appears to be ramping pretty nicely over the next three or four years, you put those two pieces together and then I think the outlook for business at DOD is pretty positive. Pete Skibitski : Okay. It\u2019s very, very helpful. Thank you. And I want to ask another question about the transaction, do you guys still fully not paying off roughly half you incurred over five years, is that still the plan? Bill Brown : Our plan is to go from 2.9 to 1.5 times net leverage over the first three years which would require us to pay make $2 billion a day roughly plus or minus in the first three years. Pete Skibitski : Okay. Got it. And then on the acquisition related cost roughly $280 million, so you -- are those all cash first of all and will get about $125 million of that in the fourth quarter on the refinancing cost? Mick Lopez : Yes most of those are cash, $125 million that we stated for the make off or the $715 million of refinancing, there is approximately another $75 million which is going to be acquisition related with Exelis severance fees, lease cancellations, restructuring sort. The remainder is basically fuel cost and financing for the bridge and some negative -- so most of it is cash. Bill Brown : And I would also just say that again presumes at June close, we expect the June close but that will presume June closing. Pete Skibitski : Okay great. Thank you very much guys. Bill Brown : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. You may begin. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : Bill, could you comment on what effect if any the strengthening dollar and softer oil prices have on your foreign pipeline at RF? Bill Brown : On the price of oil, I think it\u2019s a bit hard to say, we haven\u2019t seen any significant impact at the moment, we do know that more than half of our international pipeline is in the Middle East, Northern Africa region. What\u2019s interesting is that even though there is the price of oil has come down quite precipitously over the last six to nine months, that piece of our pipeline on a percentage basis and the dollar basis is where it was six to nine months ago even after booking a number of large orders including one that came out just a couple of weeks ago in Africa at $74 million. So we feel, we feel pretty good about that, we do know that we have a large opportunity coming over the next several years in Iraq. We do know that the country doesn\u2019t have a lot of foreign currency reserves, oil is going to be a bigger impact on Iraq but likely fortunately it\u2019s sort of underpinned by U.S. funding both in the fiscal 2015 budget as well as in the fiscal 2016 proposed OCO there is funding for the Iraq treated equipped funding. So that does backstop as a little bit for any oil related concerns in Iraq. So overall not a concern today, it doesn\u2019t mean that won\u2019t come in front of us over the next number of quarters. On FX, I think you know we do business around the world in U.S. dollars and we compete against in some markets, Euro based competitors, so over time that could have some marginal effect if we don\u2019t adjust price and if the Euro doesn\u2019t improve, we\u2019re seeing -- next couple of weeks the Euro getting a little bit better. But today no big effect but again if the dollar strengthens considerably from where we are today, there could be some effect or we have to react with pricing. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just two others, given the book-to-bill as taxable assets under one again, I just wonder, can you give us a sense for what you anticipate over the next couple of quarters? You mentioned the improved procurement environment since the quarter, what should we expect book-to-bill to trend out in the next couple of quarters? Bill Brown : So year-to-date book-to-bill was about 0.87, so I think given the current U.S. government environment and some of the pretty healthy shipments we\u2019ve made internationally I think it\u2019s a pretty good result at 0.87 and in order to get our numbers for the year and our guidance for the year book-to-bill for the year needs to come in pretty close to one. So we do know that there is some big opportunities that are coming on our way in Q4 and good again went out that we received a pretty good size award on the international side $74 million just a week or two ago. And that\u2019s I think a good positive sign. From I am not sure going to fiscal 2016 but certainly as we look out for the balance of the year which I mean couple of months away to the end of our fiscal year, we\u2019re down year-to-date about 1% on Tactical revenues obviously to be up low single digits on the year, call it a couple percent. We do see some good growth in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s going to come with some good orders that we do expect and international side has been trending pretty well, it\u2019s up high single digits. We expect it to be up high single digits for the year, which means Q4 is going to be about that same level of performance. On the DOD side, it has been softer, on the year-to-date basis we are down sort of in that 20% range, we\u2019re guiding to be in our guidance that we expressed little bit while ago on where RF as a whole is embedded in that is DOD down 10% to 12% and probably on the better side of that maybe down about 10%. That requires Q4 to be quite good, we typically see got Q4 being stronger sequentially from Q3 and we saw that last year, our Q4 revenues about double where we were in Q3 last year. We did see some positive movement in DOD in Q3 and it was reassuring to be -- to see positive growth after a number of quarters in a row being down year-over-year on DOD and also glad to see that the pipeline for DOD is getting a little bit better than we were three months ago. Last time, we spoke it was about $900 million or so in size today it\u2019s about $970 million, you know there is more that is weighted towards proposal closure finalization. So the nearer term pipeline is looking a little bit better and that gives us a bit of more comfort. At Q4 we will be better year-over-year and better sequentially in Q3 and we\u2019re accounting on that to hit the guidance and to again come back to a full year of close to a one on book-to-bill. I won\u2019t speculate at the moment going into fiscal 2016, I have more to say about that once we close Exelis and report our earnings in late July. Gautam Khanna : Okay. One last one on the eligible environment we\u2019re seeing on the jitters programs, can you comment on what you anticipate, I mean how is this is going to drive margins as these programs mature, I presume much likely in the -- contracts you will see substantial price reductions over time. And I\u2019m just curious, I think Noah asked the question of cannibalization earlier. I would like to maybe if you could just more broadly address it not just in terms of the new programs replace the single-channel 117G sales that you win Manpack for example but also just broadly on pricing. Are we going to see a big priced out on the business that is going to take our view on RF Tactical margins much lower than where they are today? Bill Brown : Gautam it\u2019s this has been over a number of years a very price competitive marketplace and frankly over the last three years since I\u2019ve been here, the nature of competition, the mix of DOD and international even with international by country is shifting around. We\u2019re increasing our systems business and yet still through all of that, we\u2019re sitting here with north of 30% margins in that segment. And even we\u2019ve been spending a lot more on R&D and some shifts happening in public safety. So overall we\u2019re finding a way to take cost out, preserve pricing and still preserve our position in margins north of 30%. So we\u2019re doing I think a very good job of managing our cost structure and prudently managing our investment pattern to maintain very strong margin in that segment. I do think that over time we will become more price competitive, it is price competitive. The nature of who we compete against may shift a little bit, but the scale advantage we have in our RF facility in Rochester, the ability to drive technology differentiation in our product over time are going to be the deciding factors over time in this business to be able to preserve margins north of 30% for the RF Com segment. So I\u2019m not -- we\u2019re not putting our head in the sand saying that there aren\u2019t dynamics happening here but I am confident in the team\u2019s ability to continue to find opportunities to both take cost out as well as invest in differentiation to maintain pricing environment that allows whole margins pretty strong in that segment. Gautam Khanna : All right. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Sullivan of Sterne Agee. You may begin. Josh Sullivan : Good morning. Bill Brown : Hey good morning. Josh Sullivan : One of your targets with the Exelis transaction is what to achieve a $1 billion in free cash flow by year four, can you just walk us through the cadence from year one to year four and maybe what are some of the gauging factors just given today\u2019s results? Bill Brown : Well it starts with it\u2019s a very, very high level. It starts with what we believe our own ability to generate free cashes on the standalone basis, this year if we look at our guidance 100% of the net income is center point of our 5 to 510 earnings per share. Our free cash will be not dramatically is in at $530 million. Where Exelis has been guiding for Counter 15 is in the $250 million to $275 million range is what they\u2019ve guided towards. See you just put those two numbers together it is million on a pro forma basis just putting two companies together. You didn\u2019t had on top of that next synergies again we\u2019re expecting $120 million net by year three, you roll that in on an after tax basis and then adding working capital improvements, capital efficiency perhaps the modest adjustments over time in the cash, pension cost and you start to approach a $1 billion by year four. And that\u2019s what we expect and that\u2019s what we communicated back in early February. Josh Sullivan : Okay, great. And then in the public safety business is the pressure more on market demand or increased competition and then is that competition coming from existing or new entrants? Bill Brown : Well there is a lot of shift happening in that public safety space. There is some consolidation. There are some shifts happening in technology and we've a very large competitor who is very focused, very aggressive in a market that\u2019s flat to down a little bit. So those are the dynamics that are happening in this particular market space we compete in the North American LMR market that\u2019s where we were at. A big competitor as more of a global perspective in terms of their footprint around the world. The market is soft. It is very competitive. I think that we've had internally within Harris some execution challenges, which we're quickly working to solve. They're going to solve themselves over the course of a number of months or quarters. It's going to take some time. We're really focused on this and we're seeing execution slowly improving. We do see quality improving. We do see customer satisfaction coming back up. We\u2019re making progress in developing and expanding our product offering. Our team, our Leadership Team is getting better. So overall, I see us improving and you'll start to see the benefits of those investments and performance showing through in the markets starts to go back. Longer term, we will see some growth in this marketplace. More than half of the market is analog that we will go digital. We do know over the longer period of time, the market will shift to LTE. It's good to see that FirstNet with the spectrum of options has been well funded. It's well more than $7 billion raise in spectrum auction. I know it's going to happen over time. It's not going to be in the next two to three years but beyond that there is going to be an impact on Harris Corporation. And I think it we will be prepared and well positioned to compete as the market shift to LTE. So those are the dynamics that are really happening in the North American space that we\u2019re face within and we\u2019ll start to see some improvements over time. Josh Sullivan : Okay. And then just one last one. Within IT services, are there any other large holes in the tent such as the NMCI contract over the next 12 months that we should just keep an eye on? Bill Brown : Well NMCI was a pretty long and toll pool within and it was the vast majority of the profit in our IT space and as you know, we were either going to compete and win it at very low margins or it was going to go away and unfortunately it went away. We have no more revenue or profit coming in IT services from NMCI, but we do still see the year-over-year impact and as we look over the next couple of quarters or year, there is no single big IT service profit generator that looks anything like NMCI. Josh Sullivan : Okay, thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Pamela Padgett : Operator, I think we have one more person in the queue. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Quilty of Raymond James. You may begin. Chris Quilty : Thanks Bill. I think you guys ramped up the draft RFP for Manpack type program late last month. Were there any surprises puts or takes on that process in terms of specifications or requirements? Bill Brown : No I think what the Army is doing I think is prudently drafting objective and threshold requirement that allows a vibrant competition to occur on the objective requirements. And incentives over time to invest a company\u2019s own dollars to improve their offering to hit threshold requirements over time, like lower weight. They are particularly interested in -- there is a number of dimensions, it's heat, it's range, a lot of things, but weight is a very, very important factor. The objective requirement if I remember right was that 14.6 pounds, but clearly they wanted to be a lot less than that and this has been something we were laser focused on and have been working on for a couple of years and we do see opportunities to take weight down pretty substantially over the near term and go below the objective requirements and actually perhaps even get better than some of the threshold requirements for weight. So no big surprise, one of the I guess may be a surprise was on the size of the ceiling value on the IDIQ at $12 billion to $12.7 billion. Its way above that what were thinking and of course it includes services and spares and sustaining cost a bunch of other things that's well beyond I think the opportunity set in front of Harris, but still at that, more than $12 billion is a quite an impressive topline ceiling value number for the Manpack, Chris. Chris Quilty : Got you and just to quantify with the rifleman program that was originated as a Army program when you look at the value of that contract is that expand beyond the Army in terms of other services? And I guess the same for the Manpack because right now you\u2019ve got customers at SOCOM Navy, Air force buying Manpack and I believe those are funded separately. Bill Brown : Yes, in fact we, interestingly the Manpack, the multichannel Manpack that was developed to compete for Army procurements is being slowed outside of the Army within DOD first and we'll sell the Manpack within the Army if the provider we win a position on the IDIQ over the next several years. So we're already selling the CMP outside of the army. On the rifleman, it's starting off as a single channel radio, but interestingly SOCOM is a two channel radio and I would expect that as the Army introduce a potential two channel into the rifleman competition, that whatever is being sold into SOCOM could eventually work its way to regular army over time and I see more of that shift happening as opposed to from Army out at least from the way I would see today. Chris Quilty : And so to clarify are those changes or increments would be inclusive of the $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion contract as it stands today? Bill Brown : My understanding is as the trailing value of $3.9 billion on the rifleman, it would include a transition to a two channel over time, but again what the acquisition objective is going to be restated to be, what\u2019s the mix of a single channel two channel is still to be determined and we will know more about that as the Army really starts to rethink the way they want the network to be given a lot of technology changes. I think the same thing is probably going to happen on the Manpack. I guess when I step back and I look at the size of where the rifleman is there almost $4 billion and the size of Manpack is north of $12 so $16 billion or $17 billion with a ceiling value between these two contracts, its far above, I think the opportunity set of over ten years for Harris. Another way to look at this is just looking at what\u2019s in the President's budget four, five years out at close to $0.5 billion per year for HMS, which is rifleman and Manpack if you just pick that over 10-year basis, $5 billion in terms of opportunity set that sort of in line with what we had thought before about the opportunity for Harris in terms of HMS for both Manpack and rifleman. That's sort of speculation on my part but that\u2019s the way I would like at sizing the overall opportunity for the company. Chris Quilty : Okay. And you haven\u2019t mentioned it in a while, but you\u2019ve also seem to made some good progress with regard to some of the airborne programs that are all getting reorganized? Bill Brown : Yeah, well we have a fantastic offering in the STT, the Small Tactical Terminal with ViaSat, which has Link 16 and UHF/VHF capabilities and the team at GCS is doing a very good job in selling that product. The army is evaluating whether they move forward with what they're calling assault in the small airborne Link 16 terminal competition. I think they spoke to the size sometime this summer, which would have Link 16 with SRW in it and that will have a play in that if the Army goes in that direction and that\u2019s still to be determined. The other one that's on the drawing board is saner which is the small airborne networking radio which is SOW and WNW and that I think the army is still evaluating that. I think I saw in the President's budget I don\u2019t know if it's in the houseroom services markup, but it's small amount like $6 million to push forward that competition on saner. We\u2019ll see when the budgets are actually set if that's happening but if there is a small amount of money that will be an encouragement that the Army is moving forward putting SOW and WNW into a saner product for the airborne side and if that happens I do think that we\u2019re going to be very, very well positioned to compete there. And also quite frankly with Exelis with up to one product that they have, there is an opportunity to actually put some of our own technology into that box if you will and offer greater capability for the airborne Tier as we combine ourselves with Exelis. So I think there is a lot of different ways of looking at how we might be able to extend our strong presence on the ground to the airborne Tier. Chris Quilty : And to clarify these are again collectively couple $1 billion incremental programs? Bill Brown : I don\u2019t think that they are going to be billions of dollars. I don\u2019t know the exact number Chris. They're still deciding whether to move forward this competition. So I think the jury is our last I had seen was center was sized at something like $600 million and Salt was sized at something like $200 billion, but it could grow over time depending upon the platform to get put on. So could it be a billion maybe, but again I think we need to wait until we see exactly how the army wants to move forward with those two programs. Chris Quilty : Billion here, billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money. Bill Brown : Yes, in terms of not just there, but also what we've seen on the ground side as well Chris. So yes, there is lots of big opportunities for Harris and again multi billion dollars worth of opportunities over the next 10 years for our company. Chris Quilty : Great. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet Chris. Pamela Padgett : Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us. I think that wraps this up for today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Pam Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett, and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; and Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. In the course of this teleconference, management may make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release and filings made by Harris with the SEC. In addition, in our press release and on this teleconference and the related presentation, we'll discuss certain financial measures and information that are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com. A replay of this call also will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning. Fourth quarter was productive for Harris and we ended the year with solid results. Harris standalone revenue and earnings per share met expectations and free cash flow was stronger than expected at 119% of non-GAAP net income exceeding our goal of 100%. A significant accomplishment in the quarter was closing the Exelis acquisition on May 29, a bit sooner than expected, allowing us to accelerate a few key actions and speed up the pace of integration. On the day of closing, we consolidated headquarters activities between Harris and Exelis. On July 1, we announced our new organizational model, creating four market focused segments and combining the top talent of both companies. And then two weeks later on July 15, we announced our intent to close Exelis's Ft. Wayne Tactical radio facility and consolidate production in our world-class Rochester manufacturing operations. So, we're off to a good start and we'll provide a little more color on our integration efforts during the call. At the end of the quarter, we closed on the sale of our commercial healthcare business to NantHealth, providing the business the domain expertise and channel leverage to allow it to reach its maximum potential. As we've expressed before, the Exelis acquisition provides us unique opportunity for portfolio shaping actions and in the context of our now larger combined company will continue to take a dispassionate view in evaluating what businesses are strategic and which are better served under a different owner. Turning now to our financial results on slide 4 of the presentation, Harris earlier today reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 in the fourth quarter and $5.14 for the full year, both of which include a $0.09 benefit from one month of ownership of Exelis. Excluding the impact of Exelis's operating results for the month of June, non-GAAP Harris standalone earnings per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter and $5.05 for the full year, with full year revenue down 4%, all in line with prior guidance and reflecting good operating performance. In the fourth quarter, higher revenue and continued margin strength for both RF Communications and Government Communications was more than offset by the anticipated weakness in Integrated Network Solutions. Orders for Harris standalone are $1.28 billion, up 17% over the prior year and significantly higher in RF Communications and Government Communications. Book to bill for the quarter was just about one 1% and for the full fiscal year was 0.98%. Strategically, we continue to increase our international footprint and invest aggressively in company-funded R&D to position the company for future growth. International revenue was up 2% in the quarter and 4% for the year increasing as a percentage of total revenue from 30% last year to 32% this fiscal year. And we increased our investment in IRAD as a percentage of total revenue to 5.7% this year compared to 5.3% in fiscal 2014, and 4% just three years ago. I was particularly pleased with our free cash flow results, coming in about a $100 million, above what we were guiding on Harris standalone basis, due to continued tightening of capital spending and improved working capital performance including higher accounts payable. Before turning to Mick to go through the details of the financials, let me offer a few high level comments on the segments. Revenue at RF Communications was up 2%, driven by a 5% increase in tactical and a 4% decline in Public Safety. Within Tactical, continued strength in international more than offset a decline in the U.S. which was a little lower than expected as a result of orders from two customers totaling $28 million, taking a little longer to finalize and missing the quarter cut. The majority is now booked and shipped. Regardless of the slip, back half for Tactical came in at a solid 6% growth with Q4 book-to-bill of 1.1% and 0.94% for the year. In the international Tactical market, a highlight was a five-year $55 million order from Australia for technical and logistics support to ensure combat readiness of our JP 2072 Phase 2 products that we previously shipped, bringing orders to date in Australia to more than $700 million. This latest win further strengthens our partnership with the Australian Defense Force and helps position Harris for Phase 3 of the country's multi-year battlefield communication modernization program that represents a $750 million opportunity that sits outside of our 12-month to 18-month pipeline. In the U.S. Tactical market, we saw continued momentum for Army modernization. As you know, early in the fourth quarter, we were awarded a 10-year $3.9 billion IDIQ contract for the Rifleman Radio, and by late July, we completed qualification testing with the customer. On the much larger Manpack program, the final RFP was released on August 3, a bit earlier than the September timeframe we previously expected with bids due in 60 days for what will be a very sizable 10-year $12.7 billion multi-vendor IDIQ contract. The Army now intends to award up to three IDIQ contracts in December, followed by qualification testing in March, and customer testing in mid-summer 2016 with full rate production delivery start dates in the first quarter of our fiscal 2018, pretty much as we expected. The published acquisition objective is for 65,000 radios, and I continue to believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant portion of this multi-year, multi-billion dollar opportunity. And then finally, our mid-tier MNVR radio for the Army completed limited user testing at NIE 15.2, a significant milestone towards full rate production. LRIPS (7:55) are expected to follow with operational test and evaluation at NIE 16.2 and a full rate production award in September of 2016. MNVR should begin to ramp in fiscal 2016 and together with Rifleman Radio should become a more significant revenue contributor and drive good growth for U.S. Tactical in 2017 and beyond. Revenue in Government Communications was up 1% in the quarter and 3% for the year, which is an excellent result given the environment. Major growth drivers for the year included our large classified win in geospatial imagery called Foundation GEOINT Content Management, continued ramping of F-35, wireless products, SATCOM terminals, and Highband Networking Radios for the Army, and mission radios for the airborne market. I'll also quickly highlight a new strategic partnership with exactEarth that we announced in Q4. exactEarth is a market leader in satellite-based remote ship tracking. And in the fourth quarter, we received a $55 million order to place 58 commercially hosted payloads on the Iridium NEXT constellation to refresh the exactEarth network. This is the same satellite platform that host Aireon and other payloads in which Harris has the prime role and it's a good strategic win for our team. Let me now turn over to Mick to provide some greater detail on the results and our fiscal 2016 guidance. Mick? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone. Slide 5 provides a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP and to Harris standalone non-GAAP earnings, highlighting $281 million in one-time deal and integration cost in FY 2015, which is in line with the $270 million to $290 million in our prior guidance. We also incurred additional charges in Q4 of a net $32 million for restructuring and other items impacting Harris standalone business, with the largest part being an intangible impairment in Integrated Network Solutions for the NMCI contract. Excluding $0.09 per share contribution from Exelis in Q4, Harris full year EPS was $5.05. On slide 6, we provide further detail on our ending cash balance and capital expenditures, which had $148 million for fiscal year 2015, include $4 million for legacy Exelis. Our tax rate for the quarter and year was as expected, ending the year with a non-GAAP tax rate of 30.2%. The favorable fiscal 2015 rate, which we don't expect to repeat in fiscal 2016, resulted from foreign tax credits, the R&D tax credit, and other fiscal 2014 tax settlements. Moving to segment results on slide 7, RF Communications orders in the fourth quarter were $530 million compared to $361 million in the prior year, and revenue was $505 million compared to $493 million last year. Tactical Communications revenue was $366 million, and increased 5%, while orders were $402 million. In Public Safety, orders were $128 million and essentially flat compared to prior year of $129 million. Revenue was $139 million compared to $145 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $159 million, excluding restructuring charges related to Public Safety. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.6% for the quarter and a strong 31.1% for the full year. Turning to Government Communications Systems on slide 8, fourth quarter revenue was $485 million, up 1% compared to $480 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, the F-35 program and Highband Networking Radios for the Army's WIN-T program was partially offset by lower revenue from two classified programs and the Navy's Commercial Broadband Satellite program. Segment operating income was $66 million and operating margin was 13.7% in the quarter and a strong 15.8% for the full year. Turning to Integrated Network Solutions on slide 9, fourth quarter revenue was $289 million compared with $373 million in the prior year, a decline of 23%, primarily due to the wind-down of two IT Services programs and continued end market weakness for both IT Services and CapRock. Non-GAAP operating income was $16 million, excluding charges related to restructuring and other items compared to $33 million in the prior year, primarily due to the wind-down of highly profitable NMCI contract and continued weakness in commercial healthcare. Moving to fiscal 2016 guidance on slide 10. Today, we're providing high level guidance on revenue and EPS with some color around fiscal 2016 expectations based on the legacy businesses of Harris and Exelis. Once we have pro forma historical information for fiscal 2015 recast into our four new segments, we'll provide an outlook by segment, as we typically do. We're initiating guidance for GAAP EPS in a range of $5.25 to $5.45, and for non-GAAP in a range of $5.60 to $5.80. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes about $60 million to $65 million of integration cost and a $10 million charge related to inventory step-up. It includes about $133 million, or about $0.70 per share, of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP EBIT margin is expected to be in a range of 16.2% to 16.7%. Putting aside for a minute the cost synergies and other impacts related to the acquisition, guidance reflects segment level operating margin for legacy Exelis slightly lower than the prior year fiscal pro forma of about 12.5%. Harris segment level operating margin is expected to be about flat with the prior year, based on legacy RF continued margin strength similar to a prior year, a more normalized operating margin in legacy Government Communications of about 15%, and for IT Services and CapRock together, an operating margin of around 9%. Other P&L guidance details are outlined on slide 10. I'll start with an update on expected synergy savings and integration cost. Our integration team has moved aggressively to capture cost synergies and is ahead of schedule. As a result, both integration costs and savings are occurring sooner than what we previously expected. We're now on track to achieve fiscal 2016 savings of $70 million to $75 million, and expect to be at an annual run rate savings of $120 million as we exit fiscal 2017, a year sooner than our original estimate and at the top end of our prior range. The $120 million in savings is net of savings that will flow immediately back to the government. Integration spending was $112 million in fiscal 2015, and we expect another $60 million to $65 million in fiscal 2016. Total integration cost is now expected to be $150 million, the higher end of our prior range, and net of about $25 million of expected reimbursements from the U.S. Government which are not anticipated to begin until fiscal 2017. As we move to our greater standardization in processes, policies and operations, we'll continue to look for opportunities for further integration savings. Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on a pro forma basis compared, with a fiscal 2015 of $8.07 billion. Legacy Harris is expected to be down 2% to 4%. This reflects our initial expectations for Tactical Communications of flat to down slightly, with DoD flat to up low-single digits and international flat to down low-single digits and continuing weakness in Public Safety, with a few percentage point decline. In legacy Government Communications, we expect another growth year of up 2% to 3%. For IT Services and CapRock together, we expect revenue to be down 13% to 15% as a result of continued end market weakness. Legacy Exelis pro forma standalone revenue is expected to be down 5% to 6%, with lower revenue from night vision and communication products and lower revenue from information systems, primarily from the $85 million roll-off of the Spacelift Range System's contract that was lost last October. Slide 11 provides some additional pension information, including an anticipated FAS pension income of about $25 million and ERISA cash contributions of $173 million this fiscal year. With cash funding remaining roughly flat at $170 million in 2017 as a result of pension smoothing provided for under the HAFA and MAP-21 legislation. Our unfunded pension liability has declined by about $200 million to $1.9 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, principally due to the mandatory funding of the legacy Exelis SERP. The effect of modestly higher discount rates and lower expected return on assets largely offset each other. So let me please turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call to questions. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Mick. The revenue outlook that Mick just described anticipates continued budget constraints and a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year. While the base budget, even under sequestered caps, is bottoming, and is expected to slowly improve. The recovery will be gradual, with headwinds persisting until budgets improve and drive new program funding. In the meantime, we continue to have a robust growing pipeline of opportunities, which is a positive sign for the future. We also put in place an outstanding team leading the new organization we recently announced. As you see on slide 12, we've organized into four market-focused segments and each segment's president is a well-seasoned executive in the government market : Chris Young with 33 years, Carl D'Alessandro with 31 years, and Bill Gattle and Ed Zoiss each with 28 years. We've taken our two most senior leaders, Sheldon Fox and Dana Mehnert and focused them on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and reigniting revenue growth across our company. I also believe we delivered on our promise to put the best of the best from both the Harris and Exelis organizations into the top jobs in the combined company with nearly half of the top 50 positions now filled by a former Exelis employee. I think the energy and enthusiasm across the entire company is very high with a lot of excitement about our future. So as we enter the fiscal year at a running start on integration and focused on exceeding our synergy goals and driving good earnings growth in 2016 with even higher accretion in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. To conclude on slide 13, we're executing very well on all critical integration success factors from my deep personal ownership of the integration program to the full time dedicated team led by Sheldon Fox, that's driving a disciplined process with speed and precision to the close oversight of the board and the constant communication with employees. The result is that we're now at the high end of our prior range of run rate savings achieved about one year sooner than previously expected with 90% of the actions underpinning the savings completed or in process in just 70 days since we closed. I'm really proud of what Harris has accomplished this past year and I'm optimistic and confident about what our new team of over 23,000 dedicated employees can deliver in the future. Together, we're committed to solving our customers' most complex challenges and driving value for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: I had a couple questions. First, Bill, I was wondering if you could expand on your earlier comment about looking at things that could be non-core. If you could just talk about what your return metrics are for making that evaluation. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, the first thing we're doing is, I mean, we're looking very hard at what fits strategically or not and we're also looking at what pieces perform well within our company. And I think you've seen over the last couple of years our willingness to take on some tough challenges on businesses that either weren't strategic or core to our company or offer good returns to our shareholders and I think we've made good decisions that add value to our shareowners and we'll do the same thing going forward. We really don't have any more today to report, Gautam, but we continue to look at the portfolio and we'll let shareholders know and you know as we make decisions. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And can you talk a little bit about the pension at Exelis? I know you \u2013 in the slide you mentioned the $170 million minimum payment this year. Are there \u2013 do you have plans underway to minimize that cash payment as we move forward? Any different approach to the Exelis pension problem that you can talk about? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, certainly, we can talk about that. A lot of work has been done on the pension in the past. As you may know, in 2011, the pension was frozen to new hires. In 2011, there was an enhanced defined contribution plan that decreased participants. In 2012, we had a lump sum program that decreased another amount of participants. And looking forward, we're taking an approach of obligations not just for the pensions, but also for some of the other obligations we have out there. And we're looking at certainly de-risking the asset portfolio, which is a concern in order to have more traditional investment matching to liabilities. But looking at the obligations, we have to stratify the pension years and future pension years and be able to offer lump sums, so we're looking at some of that for the term vested and that traditional approaches. So right now, we have a comprehensive study going on, we're using consultants and actuaries to determine what is the best course of action going forward. But we will take an approach towards the pension both on the asset side and on the liability side to de-risk it and to lower the obligations. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And last one, sale synergies, can you talk about any opportunities that you're seeing that are contemplated in the guidance or not? I don't know, does it include any sale synergies or have you seen (24:01)? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. First of all, it does not include any sale synergies. Right now, we're focused on the cost side that we've got out of the gates very, very quickly. As we've talked before, the deal was justified on cost savings, not revenue upside. We clearly do see revenue opportunities over time. We have a very good team focused on that, we're organized in a way to go and capture some of the revenue upside by the four market focused segments. I think, importantly, we put one of our most seasoned executives that you know well on Dana Mehnert. On top of global business development, one of his key responsibilities is to identify and go out and capture some of those revenue opportunity between the company. So, something we'll say more about over the course of fiscal 2016, maybe not next quarter, but certainly over the course of the year. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Well, congratulations on the great results, guys, and good luck. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Gautam, thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Pardon me, Mr. Copeland, please check your mute button. We'll move to the next question. Our next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thank you. Good morning and congratulations on a successful transaction. I was wondering as you look ahead and I know it's obviously very early to start talking about what might happen beyond next year. But when do you think about the overall company and maybe Exelis specifically moving to top line growth? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, look, we're entering a fiscal 2016 where we still have some friction in the system with the government budgets. We do expect ACR to go through the balance of the year. It could extend beyond that, we'll see over the next several months as to what's happening in DC and that does put some challenges in our business and certainly with Exelis as well. But we do see, even under a sequester budget, budget is improving in fiscal 2017, 2018. I'm very, very encouraged that we are seeing some of the modernization spending on Tactical radio start to move. And I feel good about where we're at on Rifleman, I'm really glad to see the Manpack RFP come out a couple of days ago. I'm glad to see that they are moving quickly with a 60-day proposal time period and expected to make awards in December, if all things go smoothly in negotiation. So these, I think, are good signs that there is money moving or will move over time and I do feel pretty optimistic that that'll allow our company to grow maybe not next year, but certainly in years beyond that, Seth. Thank you. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Thanks. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up on the international radios, and can you talk about maybe being flat to slightly down next year, you could just talk about the \u2013 anything shifting in terms of the regional dynamic. And I know you mentioned the Australia opportunity that comes beyond the pipeline portfolio, but anything that's kind of shifting it in the portfolio and then the pipeline, and if there is any kind of trajectory, the outlook beyond this year for international radio? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. I mean, the international business process, as you know, has been very, very strong and we ended... Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: ... the year in Q4 very strong. The orders were extraordinary. I'm very glad to see the revenue was up for the full year, was at the high-end of what we're guiding to, nearly 10%. So we feel very good about where we ended the year. The pipeline is still pretty robust at about $2.4 billion, last quarter it's $2.5 billion. I wouldn't read a lot into that. It was around a little bit time-to-time, but it's still very solid at $2.4 billion. The shape of the pipeline looks pretty much like it has over the last couple of quarters, more than half of it is in the Middle East, Northern Africa, Central Asia and that does seem still to be pretty robust though we do see in the Middle East in two specific countries some stretch out of some opportunities which we believe over time are very big for the company, one is in Iraq and the other is in Saudi Arabia. In Iraq, certainly, the price of oil that's with WTI shifting just a little bit below $45 a barrel, that's causing some impact on direct commercial sales. We do know that Iraq sales for us back stopped by U.S. government foreign military funding but there were some new commanders in Iraq and that's taking a bit slower for some of those sales into Iraq to take place. So Iraq is slipping a little bit. And in Saudi, oil is causing a little bit of a problem there. There's a new leadership team in Saudi Arabia and certainly the strife in Yemen is causing some shifting around of priorities. Those are the two things that shifted a little bit further to the right. We do see multi-year opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars in both Iraq and Saudi Arabia. So we feel good about those. Australia is very strong for us. I mentioned in my remarks a $750 million Phase 3 opportunity that's outside of our pipeline, but it's real. We were participating in that and that's going to end up happening. So longer term, we do see good opportunities in international. If you recall, at the beginning of fiscal 2015, we started international tactical with relatively modest guidance of up low-single digits and we ended up at about 10%. And I hope, going into fiscal 2016, we're being similarly conservative. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's great color. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Seth. Welcome, by the way. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Pete. Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Bill, I guess, just on the prior target of $1 billion in free cash by year four, can you update us? Are you sticking with that? And what year should we think of as year four at this point? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Year four will probably go out from four years when I first made the comment, so I wouldn't want to accelerate that from here, but I still feel confident on $1 billion of free cash flow. When I look at just where we happen to be guiding this year, at more than 100% of adjusted GAAP net income, excluding amortization \u2013 the after-tax amortization, when you run the math on that, it's sort of in the $750 million range, with a lot of moving parts and we're just getting started. You add on top of that run rate savings, some improvements of working capital, some more tightening down on capital spending and other things, and I do see that, over the next three years, four years we could definitely get to $1 billion of free cash. So, no, I'm not backing off that target. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then just on capital deployment, it looks like you're turning off the repurchase program at least for this year. Is that right? And then maybe, what's the right level of debt pay-down to factor in this year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, that's as we signaled before, our number one priority, outside of funding our own internal requirements, which of course is embedded in free cash flow, and making sure that we continue to pay an attractive dividend. Beyond that, our number one priority is debt pay-down, and that's what we're going to do, and it's important for us to de-lever. We still have the targets out there, going from 2.9 times net leverage to 1.5 times over the next three years, and that's our number one priority. So, for the course of fiscal 2016 in our current guidance, we've assumed no share buyback. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, got it. And then just last one, maybe more for Mick, but the deal amortization of $133 million, is that the same level in 2017 and 2018, or does that run off pretty quickly? And can you help us with how it loads across the quarters for 2016? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yeah, sure. Of the $1.6 billion, about $1.4 billion is in customer relations, the rest is in technology, trademarks, brands and so forth. But there is a little bit which is for the Exelis brand, and that gets amortized over two years. So we expect to have $133 million for the next two years, and then it's $125 million, or a little bit less, in the others. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Sullivan from Sterne CRT (32:05). Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: All right. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey. Good morning, Josh. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: What kind of impact does a quarter point raise in interest rates have on the pension obligation? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yes. So the sensitivity for quarter point is \u2013 and there's convexity here, right? So 25 basis points up is a decrease of $171 million, and 25 basis points down is an increase of $208 million on our liability. On the income, 25 basis points, it's about $8 million. That answer your question? Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Yes. That's helpful, thank you. And then just on the healthcare divestiture, how much was it losing a year? And then, did you receive any compensation for the transaction? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We did. And you'll see in the tables that we are presenting, and you'll see in our K, that we received about $43 million net cash in in the fourth quarter for the sale of healthcare. The transaction was about $50 million, there's some that's sitting in escrow. The cash in was about $43 million. It gave us a pre-tax gain in the quarter about $8 million. So when you look at a year-over-year basis, it's worth about $12 million delta between fiscal 2015 and 2016 in terms of the healthcare impact. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And we do have a follow-up from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : I'll hop back in. Hey, guys, on the segment guidance \u2013 the updated segment guidance, do you contemplate issuing an 8-K intra-quarter with the pro formas, or was there some other plan there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We've got a lot of work to do here on just restating the historicals and I would say that, I'm looking to Mick, but I think we'll be able to provide outlook guidance in the segment historicals restated, certainly in our Q1 release. We can't commit today that it'll be any sooner than that, but it will be at the latest at our Q1 release. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: You're absolutely right, Bill. We're working to finish the K, and we look forward to re-segmenting, providing the information to you as soon as possible. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, got it. And then on the $37 million \u2013 I think it was $37 million \u2013 restructuring at INS in the fourth quarter, is that a go-forward cost take-out for IT Services and CapRock? Is that what's going on there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, there is a piece of it, about $19 million, that's, as Mick had mentioned, is the write-down of an intangible associated with the NMCI contract that went away over the course of fiscal 2015, and that's about half of it. The balance is restructuring at CapRock. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, okay. And then, lastly, just \u2013 Bill, some of the other big opportunities, the SOCOM STC and I think the Air Force had a big program and there was SANR, anything looking like it's in the 12 months pipeline in terms of a potential award there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Nothing in the 12-month pipeline. STC, we have a baffle win and the award is expected in September. If they move on in the path, they say they're going to move on and that's on the two-channel handheld. There is a bigger program that's going forward in the Manpack and in HF radio that you will see RFPs on later than September, but that's the current trajectory on STC. And then SANR and SALT, they're going to make some decisions on these programs over the coming months, we believe. And it really depends upon what happens in the fiscal 2016 budget. But we currently are shipping our STT radios for what is considered as SALT, the small airborne link 16 terminal program, and we're already shipping our STT product in concert with ViaSat. And on SANR, it's hard to say what's going to go, that is a WNW SRW two-channel radio for a bunch of military rotary aircraft programs. But I think they wouldn't expect any production awards on that until something like GFY2019. So it's pretty far out there in the future and it's not in our horizon. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And we do have a follow-up from Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Bill, can you comment a little about how you're going to preserve profitability at the RF tactical business unit given you have some LPTA type bids coming up? So, if you were to win Manpack, for example, presumably pricing will be under some pressure. And I just wondered if you could talk about some of the levers you have, be it R&D, year-to-year, what are your expectations and other factors? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first of all, I think the team has done a really outstanding job not just in the last three years or over the last decade in taking cost out of the product and I've given some examples on prior calls on what the team has done on 117G to take costs out every year post its launch. And I would see that we'll be able to do the same thing as these new products start to come into the portfolio and mature. At the end of the day, we've got probably the largest Tactical radio facility in the world. It's going to become even more utilized as we bring in the Tactical radio business from Fort Wayne. It's both the international and the DoD business running in the same facility, it's 0.5 million square feet of world-class manufacturing, huge supply chain leverage. And on top of that, we're spending, give or take, $100 million a year on Tactical radio innovations, which I do believe, will continue to put features into our products over time, which will allow us to continue to drive what we hope to be premium price versus our competitors. I think all of those things will allow us to maintain our margins in tactical and that's what we certainly expect at Harris. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And can you help size the MNVR opportunity, what it's been running at and where you think it's going to go on an annual run rate basis? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. It's been in the \u2013 about $10 million or $15 million over the last year or two. I think we booked between $15 million to $20 million worth of orders or thereabouts. We expect in fiscal 2016, Gautam, about $20 million worth of revenue and it will ramp a little bit beyond that, probably up maybe two times or three times beyond into fiscal 2017. Again, it depends on what happens as to when they issue the full rate production award, how they want to field it, because that's changing a little bit in some of the BCT (38:40) changes that are happening in the Army. As that settles down, we do know that 2017 is going to ramp from 2016, and we think 2016 is around $20 million of revenue more or less. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And one last one, if you could just also help size HMS Manpack should you win it, I just wondered you do sell some 117Gs now, and if you could just talk about cannibalization, if there is any, if you were to prevail on Manpack. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, it is \u2013 first of all (39:10) sorry to interrupt you. On Manpack, it's not going to affect our revenue until our fiscal 2018, that's what we're thinking at the moment. Based on the schedule as we see it, if you look at just between Rifleman and the Manpack, the PBR is about $0.5 billion per year for that HMS program. And over a decade, that's a $5 billion between Rifleman and Manpack and that's our best guess on a decade-wide opportunity. Obviously, our revenues can depend our share of both Rifleman and the Manpack, but it will affect our fiscal 2018 revenue on the Manpack, probably fiscal 2017 for the Rifleman. In terms of cannibalization, we've given a lot of thinking to this and we believe that it will be mostly incremental to our base business today. Because it's being bought, the modernization it being bought by different parts of the service than what are buying (40:06) the replacement Gs, spares and other things. So our sense is that it will be mostly incremental with not so much cannibalization, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Chris Quilty from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, gentlemen. I haven't yet made it through the whole 689-page Manpack solicitation, but can you comment on any puts and takes you see in the document relative to your design and competitiveness? And can you comment specifically on the proposal for the light version and how well you are positioned for that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I didn't get through 689 pages, Chris, either but we had a really, really, good tactical team that summarized it brilliantly in four pages or five pages. And I think, look, nothing \u2013 not much has changed from the very good dialog and interaction we had with the Army during the draft RFP process. It was a couple of industry days. I mean as you know, this has been percolating for quite some time. There's been a lot of active dialog, a lot of conversation on range, power, weight, it was radio weight, mission weight, is MUOS in, is it out. There have been a lot of puts and takes. At the end of the day, the final RFP is in line with what we had expected. What I think is very interesting is that what they are going to do is look for at the time of award you have to meet certain threshold requirements, and one of which is a 16-pound machine weight, they are going to give you some additional, if you will, leverage for MUOS and some antennas and other things. Then they have a deferred threshold set of requirements that have to be met by June of 2017. And then a series of objective requirements that will fold in over time based on how industry evolves to capture some of these opportunities, again, like around power, weight, et cetera. So that's the way we see it shaking out. This whole light Manpack opportunity is going to be kind of interesting, and I don't know where it's ultimately going to go. They are looking for a lower weight Manpack. It maybe features some of the Manpack. It could potentially, Chris, be something like a two-channel handheld that would go to SOCOM (42:31) maybe over time go into regular Army. So we're unclear as to how that's going to evolve over time, but that's essentially the way we see 689 pages in a nutshell. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And with regard to the 13% to 15% decline in IT Services and CapRock, can you break it out between the two businesses and comment specifically on where you see the CapRock, the energy business trending relative to where you thought it would be six months ago? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Yeah, on IT Services, we see down about 15%. We see CapRock as a whole down about 10%. And in CapRock down about 10%, we are seeing the energy business down about 20%. Let me just give you a little color on this. Back in Q2 and Q3, the orders were quite good, we did expect the second half revenue in CapRock to turn down, and it in fact did. We came in spot-on what we thought we would be in terms of the CapRock revenue for the year. We were down in Q4 about 13%. Of course, we're seeing now price of oil just below $45, there is a potential deal with \u2013 there is a RAND issue that could drop price of oil down even further. We've calibrated, going forward into \u2013 for CapRock energy in fiscal 2016 down about 20%. We did see in the last quarter a lot of the oil \u2013 major oil service companies have done more restructuring. Rig count is down globally around 36%. We think we've calibrated for current events in CapRock being down about 20% next year. But again, we're watching very, very carefully what is happening to the price of oil, but more importantly, the behavior of our major customers in response to the price of oil and we're simply reacting to what they're doing. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Chris. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Noah. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bill, so, I guess, what are the prospects for eventually moving above the $120 million synergy run rate? It's obviously quite impressive that you were able to move it forward a full year in such a short period of time. But I guess how much is this you had identified everything and have just been able to do it much faster versus finding new things or there being potential to find a lot more opportunity to go even higher than $120 million? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first of all, Noah, our diligence was very, very good. And we're finding that most of the opportunities that we thought we would capture we have captured and not much has changed. We knew right out of the gate the first thing we would attack would be the public company cost and we did that right out of the gate. We knew there was an opportunity on the Tactical radio side between the two facilities that we had and we went at that very, very quickly. So, most of the things that we had anticipated, we were executing on. As I said, about 90% of the actions that we've contemplated going after $120 million are completed or in process, so we feel pretty good about that. But look, as I said, we're 70 days in and we're at the high end of the range we gave before. As we go forward, we continue to find new opportunities. Will there be some things that work against us? Sure, without a doubt. But I do believe that we have a good opportunity to continue to drive it above $120 million. Today, our best guess for where we stand today is $120 million. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And the cost to achieve synergy that I believe was previously outlined as $130 million to $150 million. Has that moved? I'm not 100% sure that I'm squaring that up with slide 10. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Let me give you some color on that because, first off, the $120 million on the savings, as Mick had mentioned, we reimbursed the government directly in the year immediately on the $120 million. On the cost to achieve, it was $130 million to $150 million, that was net of expected government reimbursement, and that was going to happen over a two-year to three-year time period. We had $112 million worth of integration and project cost hit us in fiscal 2015. We have another $60 million to $65 million hits in fiscal 2016. You put them together, it's about $175 million. We do expect about $25 million reimbursement by the government some time in fiscal 2017 or beyond, and that's what gets us to the $150 million. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I see. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just to follow up on that CapRock question, down 20% is not insignificant, but you mentioned what rig count has done and it's more. And you mentioned what the actual fuel price has done, and it's more. What is it about CapRock that would make it outperform the broader industry? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's really the mix of the rigs. When we say rig count down 36%, that's land, that's near offshore, it's deep offshore, ultra-deep, and we are \u2013 because of the assets, the value of deep offshore rigs are so great for the oil companies, they tend to stay in production longer. We're more disposed to offshore and deep offshore, that's where the revenue happens to be. So even though rig count is coming down like on land quite a bit more than 36%, not a lot of revenue for CapRock going into the land side, a lot more on the offshore and deep offshore. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I see. And then, any color or comment you could provide on what potential you see in the legacy Exelis business base margin beyond this year? Should we think of that as pretty flattish over time? Or is there opportunity for that to change? Or does it have headwinds going forward? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's coming down slightly in fiscal 2016 from 2015, and that's partly due to the revenue coming down a little bit, we're guiding to down 5% to 6%. When you go back to the old segments of Exelis, we do see the Electronic Systems and the night vision comms business both being down in fiscal 2016 about a mid-single digits. The IS business, information systems, will be down about 10%, with the largest piece of that, seven points or eight points roughly, that's from the loss of a contract, this range support contract, that was lost in October of last year. We do see the aero business up mid-teens, that's growing pretty nicely, with content with Boeing, with Airbus, with the F-35 ramp, they're on (49:22) the 53K with Sikorsky. They've got some good programs there. So when I look at all of the pieces and how they are moving around and what's growing, the aero business does have lower margin, so when that grows faster than the others, it does depress the overall margin rate a little bit. But I do see that there is some softening in the margins for night vision comms, and I do see some softening in the Electronic Systems business as they transitioned from what were production programs to some more development programs, and that's sort of a natural transition. So, they were down. I think we're at about 12.5% pro forma last year, if I remember right, and we're guiding to be slightly less than that in fiscal 2016. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Okay, thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Operator, I think we have one more person in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : I just wondered if you guys had a funded backlog at year-end for Exelis. And then, Bill, Exelis has had some top-line headwinds for a long time. And the question of when the trough would come is, I guess, still out there. Do you have a sense for when all these programs trough for Exelis? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, maybe \u2013 somebody is grabbing the funded backlog, I think it ended around $2.5 billion, $2.45 billion, $2.5 billion, just under $2.5 billion... Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Yes, right. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: ... on funded backlog. But look, I think there's a lot of programs here, Pete, on \u2013 in Exelis, there's a lot of moving parts. I think we've tried to take a look across all of them and make our best assessment to where the revenue is on, if you will, a pro forma Exelis business into fiscal 2016, and again, we see that down about 5% or 6%. I provided a little bit of color by each of the segments. And I don't think I will go out any further than 2016 as I wouldn't do for the core business either for Harris, but that's basically where we stand on the revenue outlook for Exelis. I think \u2013 do you have the backlog here, Mick, handy? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: I have the year-to-year total backlog was down 15%, the funded was down 17%. The orders were weak in the quarter and, of course, it's hard to gauge how much of that weakness is due to the disruption. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Thanks, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: All right. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining us and let me know how I can help. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Analysts: Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Tais Correa - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett, and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Sheldon Fox, Senior Vice President, and Integration Lead. Before we get started, a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and discussion of such assumptions, risks and uncertainties, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris' SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com and where a replay of this call will be available. And with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Pam. And good morning, everybody. Our first quarter was a solid start to the fiscal year and was our first full quarter including Exelis' operations. Integration of Exelis is progressing well with cost savings dropping through the results in Q1 and expected to ramp quickly through the balance of the year. Coming out of the gates, I was very pleased with first-quarter order strength, particularly for tactical radios, electronic warfare and intelligence systems, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.24 for the company and 6% sequential growth in funded backlog. And we are delivering on our commitment to delever, paying down term debt by $150 million in the quarter while continuing to pay an attractive dividend, which was increased in August for the 14th consecutive year. Harris is now operating in four new business segments : Communication Systems, Space and Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. In a separate filing yesterday, we provided historical pro-forma information for fiscal 2014 and 2015 combining Harris and Exelis historical results as if the companies had previously operated together and under the new segment structure, information we believe is helpful for understanding year-over-year trends. We'll refer to these comparisons as organic in today's call and presentation materials. I'll also remind you that all of our comments address non-GAAP results excluding acquisition-related costs. So turning to slide three, four, and five in the presentation. Revenue in Q1 was $1.81 billion compared to $1.16 billion in the prior year and was higher because of the acquisition. On an organic basis, revenue was down 6%, driven in large part by continuing weakness in the government and energy services markets. Earnings per share was $1.31 and included $0.17 of intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition. Acquisition-related savings are reading through an improving operating income with EBIT before amortization of intangibles up 7% to $319 million and margin increasing more than 200 basis points to 17.6%. Cost synergies were $11 million in the quarter and were on track to reach our fiscal year target of $70 million to $75 million. Also captured in improving operating performance is our ongoing focus on what we call Harris Business Excellence, our operational excellence program which targets 2% to 3% in annual net cost reduction. In addition to supporting margins, our strategy is to reinvest some of these savings into R&D and new product development to drive future growth. And in Q1, we continued to spend at a healthy rate of 4.3% of revenue. Q1 orders were $2.24 billion with book-to-bill of 1.24 and with all four segments greater than 1. In Harris' legacy tactical radio business, orders increased 30% and book-to-bill was 1.3 with strength in both U.S. DoD and international markets. Our international tactical radio business continues to be supported by a pipeline of near and longer-term opportunities across a broad set of geographies and driven by ongoing global security concerns, from NATO responding to Russian aggression, to conflict across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. In Northern Africa, the U.S. is gearing up to combat rising terrorism and the tilt to the Pacific is providing significant multi-year opportunities in Australia. In U.S., funding support for foreign military sales remained strong, both in the base budget as well as in the OCO accounts. OCO funding in GFY 2015 and proposed in GFY 2016 is supporting several special initiatives like the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund that supports regions of instability in the Middle East and Africa, and the Train and Equip Fund for Iraq. First quarter tactical orders were underpinned by the strong U.S. funding support and included $38 million and $26 million from a country in Central Asia, $39 million from two Baltic countries, and $27 million from several countries in the Middle East and Africa. Also progressing through procurement are opportunities supported by the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, with the first of these opportunities in the low tens of millions and expected to book in Q2. In the U.S. market, our base business continues to be supported by reset opportunities and sustainment, which was reflected in 1Q's broad-based order strength across the services and also included a $100 million single source IDIQ ceiling increase to $500 million for tactical radio spare part purchases by the Army and other agencies. A very big strategic win in the quarter, which is currently under protest, is a $390 million SOCOM two-channel handheld tactical radio. This radio combines communication and ISR capabilities and can receive full-motion video as well as signals-based threat information. SOCOM is typically an early adopter of technology, so we're encouraged that continuing to invest our own company-funded R&D is a winning strategy, supporting our already strong competitive position. Similar to other products first developed for the U.S. market, we fully expect this new two-channel handheld will generate strong international demand. This win is part of a larger monetization program that SOCOM has estimated could reach $900 million and include a multichannel manpack radio expected to be awarded in the fall of 2016 and a high-frequency radio expected to be awarded in the summer of 2017. In addition to the SOCOM award, we're seeing other signs of momentum building for a broad-based U.S. tactical monetization. In early October, we submitted our bid for the Army's two-channel manpack radio with award anticipated early next calendar year and our MNVR mid-tier radio for the Army is slated for a Milestone C decision in the coming months. In the airborne market, we've been selling Link-16 radios co-developed with ViaSat to upgrade Apache aircraft. And with the SALT program now canceled, we'll continue to be the sole provider for that mission. The more significant airborne opportunity on the horizon is the Small Airborne Networking Radio or SANR. Program valued at $700 million, which had been pushed out by budgetary pressures. Funding for SANR has begun and the first draft RFP is out with the second expected in December. First production buys are currently expected to begin in GFY 2019. We also had excellent wins from classified customers, receiving orders of $184 million, up significantly over the prior year and primarily in support of advanced sensor systems and space superiority. With the pivot to Asia, space superiority and protection has become a U.S. Defense priority and recent reports suggest spending in this area could reach $8 billion over the next five years. We also saw a nice recovery in electronic warfare orders, including slips from the prior quarter with the wins coming from across the air, ground, and maritime domains of our EW franchise. In the air domain, we received orders of $111 million from the Air Force, primarily for the B-52 and $97 million from the Navy for the F-18 and we won a five-year $78 million single award IDIQ from a DoD customer for rotary aircraft. In the ground domain, EW orders included $27 million from the U.S. Department of State for EGON counter IED systems. And supporting the maritime domain, we were awarded three contracts : a $113 million contract with an initial $39 million order from the U.S. Naval Sea Systems Command for radar modification kits; a two-year $49 million production contract for sonobuoy launchers used to conduct underwater acoustic surveillance on 25 U.S. and eight Australian P-8 Poseidon aircraft; and a three-year $54 million single award IDIQ from the U.S. Naval research laboratory for the Advanced Decoy Architecture Payloads program, or ADAP. The ADAP award is a strategic win, allows us to enter a new market with a potential to grow longer term. Our solution provides capabilities to address advanced maritime threats beyond what current decoys provide. And because our solution allows the customer to retrofit existing decoy shelves with our payload, it's cost-effective and it's quick. As you know, Sheldon Fox is leading our integration effort, and as we promised investors and the board, Sheldon and his team are dedicated full-time to successfully integrating two companies. So before Mick provides detailed results and guidance on the new segment basis, I've asked Sheldon to join us today to provide a status update and highlight one of our larger integration projects. Sheldon? Sheldon J. Fox - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Our integration began with a running start at closing and within the first 70 days, we had 90% of the actions underpinning the savings completed or in process. And we've continued along that aggressive path to quickly execute against our plan and expect to generate between $70 million and $75 million in savings in fiscal 2016. Well on our way to achieving $120 million run rate savings as we exit fiscal 2017. We're executing fast and executing with a great deal of focus. Each cost synergy project has a dedicated team and a detailed plan which is tracked weekly. Bill asked me to provide a little color on a key project which highlights the value we're creating through integration. In July, we announced the closure of Exelis' Ft. Wayne tactical radio facility and consolidation into our world-class Rochester manufacturing facility. In the first quarter, the last SINCGARS radio rolled off a line in Ft. Wayne and all manufacturing operations will wrap up by fiscal year-end. Currently we're taking steps to ensure that engineering and manufacturing know-how is fully transferred to Rochester including moving key employees. Slide 6 shows the floor space in Rochester that's been designated and prepped for the transition. The reduction in manufacturing square footage for SINCGARS production is significant, reducing the footprint from 90,000 square feet to 20,000 square feet and reducing 6 SMT lines down to 2. The entire facility in Ft. Wayne is about 300,000 square feet. Once SINCGARS is transitioned, we will shrink the remaining space being utilized to about 30,000 square feet until the lease expires in December of 2017. Our actions will begin to produce savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 with additional savings to follow through optimizing our supplier base and leveraging the scale and efficiency of the Rochester facility. But why is all this important, because SINCGARS remains an important communications capability around the world. The SINCGARS radio line has an installed base of 600,000 radios worldwide with about 550,000 of those in the U.S. In the domestic market, there is a very long tail of replacement and sustainment. So executing a seamless manufacturing transition will be important in supporting and eventually transitioning SINCGARS, SINCGARS users to new JTRS radios. And in the international market demand for SINCGARS radios is still fairly strong. While one of the larger initial projects, Ft. Wayne is just one of the many projects in progress. Integration process will be a multiyear effort and we're still in the early innings but we're off to a terrific start. Let me turn it over to Mick. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Sheldon. Glad to have you on the call. Good morning to everyone. Slide 7, we provide descriptions of the new segments. The following segment slide show prior-year pro forma results as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal 2015. We believe this results in a more meaningful year-over-year organic comparisons. Moving to segment results starting on slide 8. Communication Systems segment revenue was $454 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $469 million. An increase in Tactical Communications was more than offset by weakness in public safety where competitive pressures remain challenging. Within the segment, Tactical Communications has been redefined at the combination of both companies ground and airborne tactical radios with Exelis night vision products. We've provided that detail in slide 8. On this new basis, Tactical Communications revenue is up 1% primarily driven by a 7% increase in Harris legacy tactical, partially offset by lower expected revenue in Exelis legacy tactical and night vision product lines. In public safety, revenue was $92 million compared to $111 million in the prior year. Communication Systems segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $138 million and operating margin was 30.4% compared to last year's operating income of $125 million and 26.7% margin. Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on slide 9, first quarter revenue was $435 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $455 million. Higher revenue from two classified programs including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by the completion of two other classified programs and a commercial space payload program. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $68 million and operating margin was 15.6% compared to last year's operating income of $57 million and 12.5% margin. Turning to Electronic Systems on slide 10, first quarter revenue was $374 million compared to $378 million in the prior year. Higher revenue from F-35 production ramp was offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. This was primarily due to a higher mix of programs in the development phase versus production phases. Segment operating performance improved compared to prior year pro forma. Operating income in the first quarter was $69 million and operating margin was 18.4% compared to last year's operating income of $56 million and 14.8% margin. Turning to Critical Networks on slide 11. First quarter revenue was $566 million compared to prior year pro forma revenue of $644 million. As anticipated, revenue declined due to continuing services weakness in the government and energy markets. Segment operating income was $63 million compared to prior year pro forma of $72 million, but operating margin held relatively in line with the prior year on lower revenue. Moving to slides 12 and 13, fiscal 2016 guidance remains unchanged for GAAP EPS in a range of $5.25 to $5.45 and non-GAAP in a range of $5.60 to $5.80. Fiscal 2016 non-GAAP EPS excludes expected integration costs in the range of $60 million to $65 million and a $10 million charge related to inventory step up. Non-GAAP EPS includes the intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. Revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.67 billion to $7.83 billion, down 3% to 5% on an organic basis compared to fiscal 2015 pro forma of $8.09 billion. And while segment have changed, our expectations for revenue drivers within the segments are consistent with the previous color we provided. In Communication Systems, we expect organic revenue to be down 2% to 3%. Public safety is expected to be down low to mid single digits. Tactical Communications on the new basis, including the ground and airborne radios of both companies as well as night vision products is expected to be down low single digits. This aligns with our previous expectations for Harris legacy tactical, DoD flat to up low single digits, and international flat to down low single digits. Operating margin for the segment is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5%, which assumes legacy Harris tactical margin in line with fiscal 2015 and consistent with previous expectations. In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue is expected to be flat to up 2% with growth in intelligence areas, partially offset by lower revenue from space payload programs. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be down 1% to up 1% driven by the F-35 production ramp. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 18% to 19%. In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 10% to 12% due to continuing services weaknesses. With an operating margin in a range of 11% to 12% as we keep the focus on lowering costs, we continue to expect free cash flow for the year greater than 100% of GAAP net income, adjusted to add back the $88 million after-tax impact of the amortization of acquisition intangibles. So let me turn it back to Bill for a few wrap-up comments before we open the call to questions. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay, thanks Mick. So I won't repeat the budget details that all of you already know. But suffice it to say that a two-year deal will be a positive for Harris as well as the industry signaling a long awaited budget bottom in the rise in government spending. Overall, we had a good start to the fiscal year. We're capturing integration savings which will continue to ramp through the year and benefit earnings. And while we continue to expect a soft top-line environment to persist in the second quarter partially due to Exelis' relatively strong prior year-end December quarter results, we're encouraged by the orders rebound in the first quarter. Momentum for U.S. tactical modernization is building and the recent SOCOM award on top of the early awards at Rifleman Radio and the Mid-Tier Radio are a testament to the strength of Harris's commercial model and the positive return on our sustained investments in R&D through the market downturn. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : On the book-to-bill of 1.24, I think it's one of your strongest quarters ever. Is the SOCOM STC, is that win in there in the orders or because of the protest is it not in there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: No. It's not because of the protest either, but SOCOM is not in there, but it would be an IDIQ. So we would not be booking that in \u2013 as a funded order. Basically, the strength, principally, comes from very strong results in our tactical radio business, as I mentioned up 30% and pretty broad-based across both DoD as well as in international side. And we saw very good orders growth in electronic warfare and space superiority in our proprietary business and a couple of other areas. And that's really what drives that big strong orders growth in the quarter. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. That's great. That's great. And then, Bill, can you give us like you have, in the past, the size of the international radio pipeline? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. The international pipeline remains pretty robust and we're very pleased with that. It's about $2.4 billion. The shape moves around a little bit, but not a whole lot, it's been fluctuating between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion over the last number of quarters, but given our very strong orders growth in Q4 \u2013 remember, orders are up 73%, book-to-bill was 1.1% which was very, very pleasing to end Q4. We had another strong orders growth in Q1, so the pipeline remains pretty robust at $2.4 billion, and again, it's like the comments I made before in terms of its shape, it's primarily a little more than half Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia, a couple of other areas that we saw very, very good growth. And in fact, the orders growth in the quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, were pretty broad-based across the geographies outside the U.S. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hi, Seth. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just wanted to go back to one of the last comments that you made about the second quarter and I know you might want to shy away from giving quarterly guidance, but just in terms of the guidance for the year, 22% roughly, a little over 20% of the revenue in Q1, it sounds like, it's a little bit more back-end weighted whereas last year about half the sales for the combined company were in the first half. Could you talk a little bit about your level of visibility and level of confidence in the second half sales pickup? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You're right in those comments, we do think it's more back-half than front half loaded. That's the way we built our plan for the year, so it's not surprising we had \u2013 we were a little light in Q1, down 6% organically. We know that bringing Exelis into our business, we showed our numbers on a pro forma basis. They had a fiscal year last year which ended in December, so their fourth quarter was now our second-quarter. They had a pretty strong run at that quarter as a lot of companies do in the last quarter of their fiscal year. So that does give us some year-over-year headwind. And keep in mind we are still under a continuing resolution. There's no appropriations budgets yet. And that still does drive some stickiness in the funding outlays for what is now our second quarter. We do expect given the budget deal and more favorable comparisons to see a recovery in the back half of our fiscal year. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up, wonder if you could talk about trends in the Critical Networks business, I mean that's one business where it seems like the sales that you booked in the first quarter are kind of, on par with kind of, a run rate that you are looking for through the year and kind of \u2013 are things kind of stabilizing there? I know there's two markets there where there's a couple of challenges in the government services and in energy and kind of, what's the latest there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. It has been \u2013 it's a business that has \u2013 it came out of the gates a little soft and we're guiding down 10% to 12% for the full year. Q1 was down 12%. Very pleased that we're protecting the margins, I think we're doing a good job in taking cost out in spite of the pretty weak revenue environment, but Seth, you hit the nail on the head, its two soft markets. One is government IT. That we see down in the mid-teens for the year. Not different than what we talked about last time as both our IT services business as well as the Exelis IT business. Q1 was a bit down worse than that in government IT services. But we do expect that the revenue will be roughly flat sequentially over the balance of the year. The book-to-bill in Q1 was about \u2013 was over 1% and we expected to be about 1% for the year. So I think that feels pretty good. Keep in mind in IT services, we have a couple of unique dimensions happening here. One, Exelis lost the space launch range system contract prior to the acquisition, happened just over a year ago. And that's rolling through the numbers and that's about $85 million. And there's a couple of other programs that we are transitioning out of at Harris, specifically the NMCI contract and a pretty large VA program that ended last year. So there's a couple of different things, dynamics that are happening that are relatively unique in that government IT market for us. We are refocusing on the intelligence community. We think that there's an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in that space. Some of those awards are moving a little bit to the right. But I think that's going to start to see some stability through the balance of the year, as at least in terms of sequential growth. The other one that has an impact in the quarter is, as you suggested, is in the CapRock energy business. We expected that to be weak in the year. It's going to be down on a full-year basis sort of mid-teens in Q1. It was a little bit worse than that. We know that oil is still relatively weak. We saw the results from a lot of the oil service companies and majors over the last quarter. Rig count remains pretty weak. It's down about 40% year-over-year. And some of the oil majors and service companies are announcing more restructurings and CapEx cut. So, we do see continued pressure in that business. We're watching it very, very carefully. We think we've calibrated our year. But again, the market is pretty volatile at this point and we keep watching it. The piece in that, in Critical Networks is relatively stable and we feel good about it and that's on the FAA side. We've got a good portfolio of businesses with the FAA. It's pretty broad-based. And we feel very good about our position in the funding pattern for the FAA programs within Critical Networks. So, Seth, when you put all of these pieces together, a long-winded way of saying it, that's where the Critical Networks is down about 10% or 12% in the year. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Maybe just a first one on margins, if I'm reading the slides correctly, and we're looking at the pro forma margins at the segments, you had big step- ups in three out of the four segments, so is there anything to read across from that in terms of how they phase through the year or is it just a seasonally strong quarter for margins? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we don't typically see seasonal strength in Q1, it moves based on things going on in the businesses quarter-to-quarter. But I would say we do expect to see synergy savings ramping over the balance of the year. I mentioned in my comments, we had $11 million in Q1. Sheldon talked about $70 million to $75 million in the full year. So, of course, that is \u2013 it's going to happen in the bulk of that \u2013 that's yet to come and not in our numbers. So you will see some strength coming in the numbers simply because of integration savings which are booked within the segments. The other side is, we're pushing very very hard on our legacy operational excellence, Harris Business Excellence program and we do see opportunities that continue to protect margins in each of the segments, because of that. So three of the segments, very strong margin expansion, one that we feel pretty good about holding margins in spite of a pretty significant revenue downturn. So I think from Harris, good control in our cost structure so far. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. And then second question maybe on a couple of the big programs. I was wondering if you can give us maybe what your view is on the manpack contract as to how you see the field growing out. Do you think like Rifleman it will be yourselves versus a competitive field of an additional one or could it perhaps be more than one? And then similarly with what you've been able to do on the domestic programs, do you see a big opportunity to change the scope and direction of the UK's Bowman replacement and is that a major opportunity going forward, if you can get them to think outside of their current provider. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, on the first one on the manpack, its bids are in, so it's still in the source selection process. So I really don't have insight into who else has been coming to the table more than what has been rumored in the press. As I mentioned in prior comments, the Army does expect tuition award could be as early as December. We're thinking more it's early next calendar year, depends upon who comes to the table. They are expecting to issue up to three IDIQ awardees and that's what we see at this point. We do know that it's going to be a very large $12 billion plus ceiling value IDIQ and I think we're very, very well-positioned for that. So I feel very good about where we happen to be on the manpack and not much more to say at this point given the status of that opportunity. Relative to Bowman or MORPHEUS, I think that could be a pretty interesting opportunity for us. Exelis is an important player there as Harris has been. So we together are more a formidable player in the UK. We have been working with other partners in the UK. That's going to be shaking itself out over the next several years, not several quarters. So I really don't want to say too much more about how we might position ourselves for success in the UK. But Steven, Dana Mehnert who now is Head of our Global Business Development group and built tactical radios to what we do today is leading our global BD organization and I can assure you, he is focused on the UK. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. I appreciate that color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Bill, can you quantify the run rate eventually on programs like MNVR, the Rifleman program, and manpack as far as you can tell, I mean, if there are eventually two awardees on that? And then what is sort of the run rate? I know what the budgeted dollars are, but what do you actually anticipate what is a mature their run rate today? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's really hard to put a number on it outside of what's in a PBR, Gautam, to be honest with you. I'd be speculating and, boy, I hate to do that on these kinds of calls, so I won't. As we said before, MNVR last year was sort of $8 million to $10 million, $12 million in revenue. This year it will be a little more \u2013 twice that, $20 million to $25 million. We see that could grow to $40 million to $45 million. Again, it depends upon what the Army wants to do and how they are going to field the radio in their BCT structure and also it's a lot of the dynamics that come into play. We do know that between the Rifleman and the manpack that we've been told could be a procurement up to about $0.5 billion. If you look at the PBR, that's what it says. We don't have any more insights relative to the total market opportunity for us. What our job is to do is to put forth our most aggressive approach of fantastic technologically advanced and innovative products and we're 100% sure of that business, whatever it happens to be and that's what we're focused on. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Can you comment on what the Rifleman is running at in the current fiscal year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, Rifleman won't be any revenue in this year or next. It will start to ramp in \u2013 at the end of fiscal 2017 is when the Rifleman will start to ramp. It's probably the second half of our fiscal 2017 and it will become a little bit more meaningful in fiscal 2018. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. In terms of the \u2013 you mentioned the recent minimum requirement of $173 million to the pension. Can you comment on any initiatives you've undertaken to reduce the ongoing cash burden of the pension? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Gautam. I'll pass it to Mick and let Mick comment on that. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Thank you very much. I think as we've said, there have been multiple actions taken in the past from \u2013 in 2011 freezing the new hires and lump sums liabilities given out. And we actually froze the benefits in the end of 2016. So moving forward, we see that we're trying to address the asset side and the liability side. On the liabilities, we are considering some cash balance for the actives, perhaps some lump sum for some of the term vested employees to take advantage of the IRS rulings and insofar as moving forward to matching our assets to the obligations longevity. So we will derisk through defined glidepaths and with specific trigger points. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Is it fair to assume that in your $1 billion free cash flow, you are targeting four years out that you're not expecting a meaningful decline in the ongoing cash contribution of $170-or-so million? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We see a modest reduction in cash contributions go into next fiscal year, fiscal 2017 sort of in the $170 million range. But we do see the 2019, 2020 period down could be quite less than that, so in the fiscal 2019. So when you sort of think about three years out, fiscal 2018 hitting $1 billion, hitting that $1 billion of free cash flow target three years out does not include really any reductions in pension contribution, it really happens beyond that horizon. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Okay. One last one. On the foreign pipeline, the $2.4 billion. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Are you anticipating any significant single contract awards in that or is it a fairly lumpy thing or is it diverse across many smaller opportunities, if you could just give us some sense if we should be expecting like a huge Australian win or a huge Saudi win, what should we be looking for? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: There are certain markets and you hit on a couple that are quite large in a longer-term pipeline and we do see our position in Australia strong. There is a procurement on the horizon, it goes out beyond 18 months that is quite substantial and we're in the midst of that, but it's not in that 12-month to 18-month pipeline. It really is pretty broad-based. It's across a lot of different markets, through the Middle East, through North Africa into Central Asia. It was very, very good to see FMS funding through OCO accounts continuing to bolster what's happening in Iraq through the Train and Equip Funds, through ERI, which flowed through into some opportunities in the Baltics. We saw some good opportunities surface in Latin America this past quarter and are still in our pipeline. So, Gautam, it is pretty broad-based. There's not any big substantial orders that are in our 12-month to 18-month horizon that I'd want to single out. Beyond that, there is some big opportunities in markets like in Saudi as well as in Australia, but nothing as gigantic in the next 18 months. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Quilty of Raymond James. Your line is open. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Wanted to touch on the two legacy Exelis programs. You mentioned within the Space and Intel a downturn in some commercial space payloads, I assume that's the old Kodak camera manufacturing business and there have been lots of changes in terms of the space imaging business. Can you give us a sense of what you think the prospects for that business are on a go forward basis? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Chris, hey, thanks for the question, Chris. And I'll take the first and maybe turn to Sheldon on the second and he can elaborate a little bit. The downturn in the space payload really is more legacy Harris than legacy Exelis. Remember a couple of years ago we booked an opportunity with Aireon for putting hosted payload on an Iridium NEXT constellation. That work has been through the pipeline. We're delivering vehicles. We're pretty far down the path of recognizing revenue and opportunity. And that's started to move back off. So that's more on the legacy Harris than legacy Exelis perspective. Let me turn it to Sheldon maybe to give a couple of comments on outlook for space imaging. Sheldon J. Fox - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Chris, the outlook up in Rochester for Exelis' legacy imaging business is actually very strong. They've had an upturn in the number of new orders and new programs they have. They are hiring up there in Rochester. And they've developed some exciting new technologies that we believe have application both in their traditional market spaces and in this new emerging commercial market imaging space. So we're very bullish on their imaging business in Rochester. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got you. And the other legacy Exelis question. The counter IED programs, it seems like you had a nice order this quarter. What's the longer-term prospect in that area? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, certainly, this year it's going to be pretty solid, and it's going to be a driver of growth in 2016 over 2015. It remains to be seen what happens beyond 2016, but right now we feel pretty good about the opportunity we saw come through the Department of State and that's going to drive growth this year, Chris. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Tais Correa - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, all. It's actually Tais Correa from Noah's team. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Tais Correa - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, we were curious actually on how you see the new budget deal helping short cycle defense, if you could give us a little bit of color on that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, look the two-year deal is pretty encouraging to us. It's encouraging to the rest of the industry. It's going to eliminate some of the overhang of uncertainty and all that's, I think, good news. I think you know the budget like we do. DoD is up 5% fiscal 2016, maybe another 2% in 2017. So that's pretty good. We were very pleased with the size of the OCO accounts, because some of the funding that we use for international comes out of OCO accounts like ITEF and ERI and a couple of Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, other things that will help us definitely in 2016 and going forward into 2017. But look, it's a deal. There is no appropriations bills yet. That needs to flow itself out and that will happen between now and hopefully December 11. But judging by what was in the NDAA that was unfortunately vetoed by the President, but it's going to flow back through, I think a lot of the Harris programs seem to be well supported both in the tactical, normal tactical line as well as in other things that affect Harris Corporation. So I do think that the budget deal and the certainty and the level of funding is going to be good news for Harris both short cycle and medium cycle opportunities as well as rest of the industry. So I think net-net it's good news. Tais Correa - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. That's helpful. And just if I may another question, if you could break down the $2.2 billion in orders that you have by the new segment, it would be helpful too. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I don't think we're going to do that today. I'm sorry. I gave the comments on where we saw some strength and I gave some comments on where we saw a little bit of weakness. But I think we'll stay at that relatively high level of color at this point. Tais Correa - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Peter. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah, guys. Couple of follow-ups. Can you share with us your expectation for cash taxes for the full year? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I'm going to turn it to Mick on cash taxes. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Look, our tax rate is as we said is going to be about 34% for the year. First quarter was a slight lower. The timing of the cash taxes depends from quarter-to-quarter, but I think for the year it will be slightly lower than 44%. We have some credits from last year. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And then, on operating working capital, you guys are normally really good on a full-year basis on operating working capital, it looks like in the first quarter there may be some timing items. Do you expect to kind of, make that up as you go through the year or just you're going to be more of a use of cash for working capital? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: No. We do expect to make up for what we knew was going to be some snapback that happened in Q1, you recall in our Q4 release, we had some \"overdrive\" on AP on payables and we said about half that was going to snap into Q1, it did. But we're focused on improving working capital over the course of this year. That's an important driver for our free cash flow guidance that we've given to investors. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Great. And, I guess, if I could sneak in a last one. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : I wanted to hit the legacy Exelis product lines. If I do the math, it looks like Exelis night vision radios is down probably on the order of 20% or so. Should we annualize that? Is that business dropping off that quickly? I was kind of expecting it had already troughed kind of after the war drawdown. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Look, I won't give color so deep into the businesses at that level, but I would say that on the night vision side, five years ago, it was quite big based on what was happening in the wars. It's come down. It is starting to bottom out and flatten out and we are doing, I think, an outstanding job in our Roanoke facility to improve quality and meet delivery schedules with the Army, regain credibility with \u2013 I think we're doing a very, very good job. And I do see stability in that business. As Sheldon mentioned in his remarks, on the Exelis side, there is a very large installed base as SINCGARS radio in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And in fact, there are lots of countries that have standardized on SINCGARS and they'll continue to buy that. So we do expect to see growth opportunities in SINCGARS, and hopefully, we can leverage more of the existing Harris channels to open up some new opportunities that hadn't been there before. So I wouldn't give any more color than that. There has been some downturns in that night vision comm systems business. But we feel pretty good about the prospects going forward. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah. Thanks again. Hi. So, you mentioned in the foreign pipeline Australia and the Middle East are big kind of opportunities and I just wondered, those are commodity-linked economies, the U.S. dollar obviously has strengthened. I just wondered are you seeing any incremental price pressure or delays in terms of procurement RFP to actual contract signing. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. We do see price pressure all the time in our international business, because it's very competitive and that has been the case and it's one we continued to deal with through a lot of cost reductions and bringing technology. We sell our product in dollars and that does cause some headwinds with non-U.S. providers, some competitive pressure. But we respond aggressively to that. On the other commodity side, which is on the oil side, we have seen some stretch outs in a couple of markets. We talked about this last time that remains the case today in Iraq and in Saudi where we have seen some stretch out in some of the opportunities, that's factored in our pipeline, it's factored in our guidance for the year. We do know that in Saudi, they have prioritized investments for their military for \u2013 to combat the border strife with Yemen, but again those things have already factored into our guidance. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And one other thing, if I recall the Exelis pension, I think the majority of it related to non-Exelis employees and I'm wondering could you update us on that and how much of that pension is actually recoverable via cash reimbursement? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Yes. There is about 47,000 participants in that pension and insofar as the number of employees, it's about almost 50-50. But the majority because of the activeness of the retirees is mostly defense-related. And I think we mentioned that last year the CAS recoverability for Exelis was about $129 million. We expect that to be a little bit higher in FY 2016. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And how does that relate to the FAS, just remind us? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: The FAS is a positive income of $25 million. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And just in terms of as we look forward at fiscal 2016, 2017, 2018, could you just give us a sense for what the downturn is going to be between FAS and CAS? Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: They are going to be fairly constant, as you all know a lot of it depends on your expected return on assets on your discount rates. Looking out at year is, I would say going to be very, very constant not large changes. We've actually done some sensitivity analysis for what happens if the market gyrates up or down and it's not that significant change. It does materially impact you in the further out years and that's way we like to keep our guidance to current year. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Just one quick follow-up. The booking strength in the first quarter was very impressive and I know it's not something we can expect every quarter but how would you think about the possibility to end the year with book-to-bill greater than one across the company? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's a good question, Seth and that's certainly what we aspire to do every year \u2013 is to build our backlog. So that certainly would be our goal for the year as we see where we are at today. But you are right, we had a good start to the year. 1.24 book-to-bill is pretty good, the backlog coming up is pretty good. I was very pleased Seth as you could imagine with the growth in the tactical business and increasing in tactical backlog and I think if that holds through the year, I think we'll be in great shape. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Excellent. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Seth. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Operator, I think we have one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Steven Cahall of Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Steven Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Just a follow-up on the portfolio. I think in the last quarter, you talked about taking a dispassionate approach and possibly seeing some opportunities for portfolio shaping. So I was wondering if you could just update us with that and are there any specific businesses, where you think you might be subscale be that some of the legacy Exelis businesses like the structures or PSPC or Critical Networks, and should we expect to see a discontinued operations line at some point in the relative near future? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, Steven, we continue to take a very dispassionate view, so thanks for remembering that. We have said that as we're now an $8 billion company with a broader set of businesses we have an opportunity for some portfolio shaping. We're really taking a hard look at that. We're looking at across all of the different businesses. You threw a couple of names out there which we're obviously not going to comment on any specific plans today. We're not ready to do that. But it's something we continue to look at. And as we have things to announce or discuss with investors we'll be certain to do that. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Okay. With that last question, I think we'll close the call for the day. Thank you everyone for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett, and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; Mick Lopez, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Sheldon Fox, Senior Vice President, Integration and Engineering. So first a few words on forward-looking. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information on a related discussion, please see the press release, presentation on Harris' SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call is also available. Okay, with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Our second quarter and first-half results are largely in line with our expectations for how fiscal 2016 would unfold. While Q2 revenue was a bit weaker than expected, we anticipated operating within a continuing soft revenue environment with Q2 being the weakest of the year relative to prior-year results, due to the budget process and a difficult compare in the legacy Exelis' business. And as we'd previously communicated, our number one priority this year will be integrating Exelis' and realizing the synergy savings and earnings accretion we have promised, and we're executing well against that goal. We're also delivering on our commitment to maximize free cash flow to quickly de-lever and to dispassionately evaluate portfolio reshaping, as today's announcements and results will demonstrate. Second quarter earnings were solid and free cash flow was particularly strong. And again this quarter, we made excellent progress in achieving integration savings. We've also identified additional opportunities and now expect to reach run rate savings, exiting fiscal 2017, a $140 million to $150 million, significantly higher than the $120 million we previously communicated. First-half free cash flow was supporting our deleveraging priority, reducing term loan debt $200 million in the quarter and $383 million since closing the transaction in late May. We're also pleased to report being far down the path of divesting the aerostructures business, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and was determined to not to be strategic to Harris. Aerostructures is currently reported within the Electronic Systems segment and had calendar 2015 revenue of $77 million. After receiving considerable interest from potential buyers, we are narrowing the group to a select few and expect to reach a definitive agreement soon. We'll also continue to evaluate our now much broader portfolio with a dispassionate view towards which businesses are strategically aligned and which are not. We also continue to adapt to market conditions and adjust our cost structure accordingly, as we had in the past. In the second quarter, due to the prolonged downturn in CapRock's energy market, we took a non-cash write-down of goodwill and other assets and we launched restructuring and other actions that were primarily in CapRock. Our goal is to right size the business in-line with market conditions and these latest actions reduced their head count by about 20%. When combined with steps we took in Q4 last year, head count at CapRock will be down about 35% over the last 18 months. Altogether, these actions are expected to generate modest savings in fiscal 2016 and about $20 million to $25 million in fiscal 2017. So, let me turn quickly to quarterly results in slide three in the presentation and I remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Earnings per share was $1.49 with acquisitions, savings, supporting, operating performance in a still relatively soft revenue environment, with the recently reenacted R&D tax credit, contributing $0.10 per share. Reported revenue was $1.84 billion compared to $1.21 billion in the prior-year. And on an organic basis, while we anticipated a difficult year-over-year revenue compare, it was a little weaker than expected a down 14%, so let me give you a little more color on the drivers. About four points to five points of the decline related to Exelis overdrive in their Q4 2014 results. Government IT services contributed another five points, as we mentioned before would be impacted by the wind-down of a couple of large contracts in a still slow procurement environment. And CapRock was another point or so, with the remaining business contributing about three points. On the positive side, Harris legacy international tactical revenue was up a strong 10% in the quarter, resulting a Harris total legacy tactical revenue at about flat with the prior-year and about as expected for the quarter. Revenue was also higher in geospatial imagery, driven by the continued ramp of our large classified Foundation GEOINT Content Management program, and was also hired with the FAA driven by NextGen modernization programs. On a sequential basis for the company, revenue was up 2% with all segments higher except Critical Networks, which include IT services and CapRock. Orders in the quarter were $1.5 billion and together with strong orders booked in Q1, first-half book-to-bill was just over one. In IT services, although revenue was down in the quarter, orders were encouraging driving a book-to-bill of 1.1 for the quarter and the first-half, and we expect first-half orders combined with incumbent positions on existing programs will support back half revenue stability. In CapRock, our strategy that diversify our business into the cruise market where bandwidth demand is growing is helping to offset a bit of the energy revenue weakness. Over the last two years, bandwidth demand on cruise ships has increased exponentially from an average of less than five megabits per ship to now 35 megabits with one gigabit insight for the largest vessels, and it's important to note that our position in the cruise market is solid with 2.5 years left on our five-year agreement with Carnival and another five years left with Royal Caribbean following a contract extension that was awarded in the quarter. Perhaps as important, diversification brings us significant volume leverage for purchasing satellite bandwidth and our scale has allowed us to consolidate bandwidth, drive down cost and implement a sales approach of one price over one global system regardless of market to further drive efficiency gains in the organization. In Tactical Communications, we previously highlight that U.S. funding support for foreign military sales from both the base budget as well as from OCO accounts for special initiatives, such as the European Reassurance Initiative, the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund for Middle East and Africa. In the Iraq Train and Equip Fund, or ITEF. The funding supported our strong 1Q bookings, and in 2Q we booked $66 million in orders supported by ITEF. We ended the first half of the year with an international tactical book-to-bill of 0.99. On the U.S. tactical front, progress continues to be made on Army modernization and we were encouraged that the Army requested best and final offers from all bidders for the two-channel manpack radio and reconfirmed their calendar Q1 award date. In Public Safety, orders were up more than 30% on a weak prior-year compare with book-to-bill greater than 1 on a fairly good revenue level of $109 million. Orders included $20 million from Arizona Public Services, the state's largest electric utility company, and $18 million from the Air National Guard that includes our latest product offering, the multiband XL-200P radio. While we're still not satisfied with our Public Safety results, we've expressed multiple times that improving performance in the business will come as a result of solving basic execution challenges, introducing new products, improving quality, strengthening frontline and program management capabilities, and we're beginning to see positive signs that the business is slowly turning the corner. In Space and Intel, on top of strong Q1 wins from classified customers we received healthy orders of $172 million and another $23 million contract to support space superiority missions. Space superiority and protection has become a U.S. defense priority and is expected to receive $8 billion in funding over the next five years. Our first-half wins in space superiority combined with the strong funding support should make this an area of solid growth for the company into the future. And following the close of the quarter, the Space and Intel segment was awarded a $316 million follow-on contract for NASA for the Cross-track Infrared Sounder, or CrIS, payloads on the third and fourth weather satellites for the Joint Polar Satellite System. These payloads provide key global data used by the National Weather Service, and for Harris the award continues the strong customer relationship we enjoy with NASA and with NOAA. And then just recently in Critical Networks, we were awarded a nine-year, $44 million contract from the UK's air navigation service provider called NATS to modernize their voice communications infrastructure. This represents our first international win in this area and results from leveraging technology provided under the FAA's NextGen modernization program to now address the global market. So, with the successful integration of Exelis as our number one focus for the company, I've asked Sheldon to join us again this quarter to provide a little more detail in integration and the additional opportunities the team has identified. Sheldon? Sheldon J. Fox - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. So, turn to slide four. Again this quarter, we've made excellent progress in achieving integration savings and have identified several new opportunities. The team quickly developed plans to capture these additional savings, and we're pleased to report that 100% of our cost-saving projects are either complete or in progress. As Bill noted earlier, we now expect net run rate savings to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million as we exit fiscal 2017, up significantly from our previous estimate of $120 million. Associated with this, we now expect gross integration costs of $250 million and net costs of $200 million after government reimbursements. Additional savings are primarily in two areas, footprint rationalization and supply chain. In the Q1 call, we highlighted moving the SINCGARS tactical radio manufacturing operations from Fort Wayne to Rochester. And just last week, we completed production of our very first SINCGARS radio assembly in our Rochester state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. With this project well underway, we've launched new facility consolidation projects in five locations that will reduce footprint by an additional 230,000 square feet, bringing total company's square footage reduction related to the acquisition down 15% since closing. The second area of additional savings comes from a thorough review of our supply chain. We spent a lot of time building a database to compare what Exelis buys to what Harris buys and what each pays on price, down to the individual part number to understand our supply chain spending across the combined company. With this database in place, we launched multiple projects across a broad range of spend categories, from electronic components to company travel, to eliminate price disparity and leverage our much larger volume to reduce cost. We also launched should-cost analyses and value engineering initiatives to further drive supply chain savings. A quick example is the should-cost analysis that identified a 20% reduction in the price of a key component used across our night vision product line. We see a lot of opportunities like these which will add to our pipeline of regular annual operational excellence projects. And while not highlighted on the page, an underlying core theme of our integration is to reduce complexity throughout the company, and we're using this opportunity to take a best-of-both-companies approach to simplify and standardize across the new Harris. We've already reduced a number of health plans by 50%, corporate policies by 40% and legal entities by 12%, and we're targeting a 50% reduction in core IT applications and an even greater reduction in the number of data centers. So, as we enter the back half of the first year of integration, we're excited about the progress so far and confident that driving standardization and simplification across the business to build a solid foundation for the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mick to discuss segment results. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Sheldon, and good morning to everyone. Before turning to each segment, we'll provide some color around the one-time items in the quarter that are excluded from our non-GAAP results and also point you to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations on slide five. Unrelated to the acquisition, we had a $367 million non-cash charge to write-down goodwill and other assets in the CapRock business, as a result of the prolonged downturn in the energy market. Acquisition related items included $101 million benefit for a net liability reduction for certain post-employment benefit plans, $43 million of integration costs, and a $3 million charge related to inventory step-up. We also had restructuring and other charges totaling $35 million with the majority for workforce and facility reductions. So, turning now to segment detail on slide six, in comparisons to prior-year pro forma results, as if Exelis' and Harris were combined for all of fiscal 2016. Communication Systems segment revenue was $489 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $539 million. Tactical Communications revenue was down 10%, declining primarily due to weakness in Exelis' legacy tactical and night vision product lines. Harris legacy Tactical Communications was above flat as a result of strength in international. Public Safety revenue was $109 million compared to $116 million in the prior-year, declining year-over-year, but up 18% sequentially quarter-to-quarter. Operating income in the second quarter was $138 million and operating margin was 28.2% compared to last year's operating income of $144 million and 26.7% margin. Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on slide seven, second quarter revenue was $446 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $488 million. Higher revenue from two classified programs including the Foundation GEOINT Content Management program was more than offset by the completion of other classified programs and lower GPS III revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $67 million and operating margin was 15% compared to last year's operating income of $87 million and 17.8% margin. Turning to Electronic Systems on slide eight, second quarter revenue was $382 million compared to prior-year pro forma of $451 million. Higher revenue from the ramp in F-35 production was more than offset by lower electronic warfare revenue. Operating income in the second quarter was $69 million and operating margin was 18.1% compared to last year's operating income of $78 million and 17.3% margin. Turning to Critical Networks on slide nine. Second quarter revenue was $541 million, compared to prior-year pro-forma of $672 million. Lower revenue in IT services and CapRock's energy market was partially offset by higher FAA revenue driven by NextGen modernization programs. Operating income in the second quarter was $71 million and operating margin was 13.1% compared to last year's operating income of $83 million and 12.4% margin. So, let me turn it back to Bill, for the guided discussion and a few wrap up comments. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well. Thank you, Mick. So, moving to slides 10 and 11, revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 3% to 5% to now down 5% to 6%. We expect the impact of lower volume on earnings to be more than offset by the flow through of the R&D tax credit and cost savings across the company. As a result, non-GAAP EPS guidance has been increased to a range of $5.70 to $5.80. And to remind you, non-GAAP includes intangible amortization from the Exelis acquisition of $133 million or about $0.70 per share. In Communication Systems, expectations are unchanged. In Space and Intel, operating margin expectations have been revised to a range of 15% to 15.5%, primarily to reflect a higher mix of costs plus revenue and new program starts. In Electronic Systems, revenue expectations have been revised to a range of down 2% to 3%, due to a few losses in electronic warfare pursuits, combined with a slower than expected ramp of previous electronic warfare wins. In Critical Networks, revenue expectations have been revised to down about 14% due to further weakness in Government IT services and CapRock's energy market. So, to wrap up, as I said, upfront, our top priorities are successfully integrating Exelis, delivering strong free cash flow, deleveraging our balance sheet and continuing to reshape the portfolio and through the first half of the year, we're making good progress on all of them. So, while we still face top-line pressure in fiscal 2016, integration and other cost reduction actions are driving good earnings growth and we expect this rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal 2017. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you... Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Good morning, guys. Wondering if you could give us some of the metrics that you've provided us in the past with respect to tactical backlog, book-to-bill and the respective pipelines, U.S. and foreign? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. That's a lot of information, I think it's in there. Let me see, if I could hit on some of the key things and I'll provide you, I think as much as I can on that. First part, on the book-to-bill, this is all legacy tactical radio, so go back to sort of the how do Harris define tactical radio. Our book-to-bill in the first half was 0.97, so international is 0.99, as mentioned on my remarks and DoD was a little bit less than that. Little bit softer in Q2, but we had a very strong Q1, remember it was about 1.3. Revenue, we believe, came in about as expected in the quarter, a bit stronger in international, which is, we say, was up 10%, little bit lower in the DoD, it's flat overall in Q2, and up 3% in the first half. So, I think, overall a pretty decent start. For the full-year, we still see revenue being flat to down low-single digits, we still see DoD to be flat up slightly, and international will be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And it's really shaping up almost as we had expected when we initiated guidance six months ago, up first half, down in the second half on a year-over-year basis with two bigger tranches in two specific countries winding down that makes for a tougher comparisons in the back half. We still see sequentially the second half being up versus the first, with Europe and the Middle East both contributing pretty nicely, in fact got on this year, we think Europe is shaping up to be a record or near record year for us, driven a lot by this ERI, U.S. government funding for Ukraine and the Baltics, as well as a few other Central European, Eastern European countries. But, we do see the impact of lower oil pricing that's shifting some of the priorities in some of the countries in the Middle East as well as some of the priorities of the U.S. government, so that's giving us a little bit more caution in the back half, but still we see second half up sequentially from the first half. Now, let me turn to the pipeline and just quickly cover that. On the international side, the pipeline is still very robust. It's now $2.9 billion, last time it was $2.4 billion, so it's come up as we brought in about a $600 million opportunity for Phase 3 modernization in Australia, we expect that award at the end of fiscal 2017, so that is now into our 12-month to 18-month pipeline, the Middle East is still very solid. On a dollar basis, it's still about the same as it was before. On a percentage basis, down a little bit now slightly under 50%, because the size of the overall pipeline has increased. So, still very, very broad. Again, Europe is strong, Cal is holding serve and we see Asia coming up pretty nicely mainly because of Australia. So, that's on the international front. On the DoD side, the pipeline at $890 million, so down slightly from where we were last time of about $925 million, so it's just under $900 million. The mix is still about the same 60% Air Force, SOCOM, Marine Corps and about 25% being Army impart modernization, impart resets and other opportunity. So, let me stop with that Gautam let me see if I answered the question that you're trying to get at. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, you definitely did. And I was wondering also originally when you announced the acquisition of Exelis' you laid out $1 billion free cash flow target a couple of years out. I was wondering, with the new synergy target and what have you, are you still comfortable with that, do you see upside to that? And if you could maybe bridge us from where we are today at $750 million of free cash to that $1 billion. What are the big puts and takes that get us there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first, I think, for this year, we're still feeling very comfortable at our free cash guidance around $750 million as we noted in our guidance and that numerically hasn't changed, the words around it have, but numerically it's the same as we guided before, so $750 million. And without getting beyond 2016 guidance, we do still see three years or four years out $1 billion in free cash flow and the drivers are as we expected before. We do see the higher run rate synergies impacting that free cash flow, so growing from $750 million. And we see interest rate reductions \u2013 interest cost reductions coming down because we're paying down some debt. We do see continued working capital performance improvements over time. Recall, we're at, as Harris last year in fiscal 2015 about 46 days of working capital. Exelis was quite a bit higher than that. We came in at about 56 days at the end of Q2. So just as we get back to where Harris was before, we see another 10 plus or minus days of improvement to working capital at about $20 million per day. So, we'll close some of that this year, but even if we don't close all of that it still could be substantial increases in cash flow just simply from working capital. Of course, we also see a little bit of capital spend efficiency over time as well. So, those are the major elements. Again, we're still confident about $1 billion three years to four years out. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I'll turn it over. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay, Gautam. Thank you. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just from a disclosure perspective, I had the same question as Gautam and I've probably had it e-mailed to me two dozen times already this morning from your investors just on what the \u2013 in the quarter, the domestic and international organic revenue growth and book-to-bill were. So, I know the business has become more complex with Exelis, but if it's possible to just provide that in a clean way in the decks going forward, I think that would be helpful. Just as one person's opinion. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Okay. Thank you, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In terms of the Middle East comments you just made there on the international piece, Bill, could you maybe just go back to that a little bit? First I thought I heard you make an incrementally positive comment, then I thought I heard an incrementally negative comment and we hear a decent amount of concern out there on what might happen in that business for you because of the oil price. So can you just dig a little further into the trends? And if you're able to size how big that is as a percentage of your international business right now, that will be helpful. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we've been cautious over the last two quarters or three quarters that the declining oil prices are impacting \u2013 seeming to put some friction in the pace of awards that we're seeing in the Middle East. It doesn't impact the overall size of our international or our Middle East pipeline. We still see opportunities there, the flow of those opportunities through the pipeline are seeing a little bit more friction. We know in Saudi, Saudi has been a significant opportunity for us, one of the bigger in our pipeline, like Iraq happens to be and others throughout the Middle East. There's five countries or six countries that make up the biggest part of our international Middle East part of our pipeline. And we do see in Saudi, in particular, where their focus on the war in Yemen and military purchases to support that, we're seeing some of the opportunities on our radio business slip a little bit to the right, both in terms of Harris as well as what was legacy Exelis. So, that has slipped a little bit to the right. But overall, I think the opportunity in the Middle East still remains out there. The pipeline size is still very, very good and very robust. I'm very encouraged by the fact that there is strong U.S. government support, FMS support for opportunities in the Middle East. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we talked about this last time, the ICAP funding, that flow from the U.S. government is flowing in and is helping us in Q2 and we do expect to see more opportunities into the future. GFY 2016, it was about \u2013 just over $700 million worth of ICAP funding. There is this Counterterrorism Partnership Fund which includes amounts for Syria; it's $1.1 billion. So, there's lots of U.S. government funding that does backstop our Middle East pipeline. So, as I said in my remarks, we do see on a year-over-year basis the second half intact, it will be down, but sequentially up first half to second half. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And is it possible to size how much of your international revenue comes from the Middle East in tactical radio? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's probably, on the pipeline itself, it's just under 50%, so it's probably, on the international side of our revenue, it's 40%, 50%. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And then, at CapRock sort of a similar question. Can you quantify what that's run rating now on a quarterly or annual basis, just so we can get a sense for, I guess, how much it's already come off the peak? And what are margins like in CapRock energy at this point? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: The CapRock energy business year and a half ago was around \u2013 about $400 million and down about 30%, so it's running this year just under $300 million on a reported basis for fiscal 2016. We would expect by the time we hit Q4 to be a run rate somewhere \u2013 around $250 million or a little less than $250 million is the way that we're sizing it, so that's around $60 million, $65 million per quarter, and will this year be a mid-single digit margin business. By the fourth quarter, we are starting to kind of bump around breakeven based on the size of the business being where it happens to be, which is why we've taken the strong actions we've done to restructure, reposition that business. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just final quick one. Did aerostructures come out of the revenue outlook or will that happen after its final sale? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We'll bring that out after we sold the business. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Noah. Thank you. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. You may begin. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, guys on the Exelis radio and night vision volumes, are they coming in below plan or below expectations, it looks like by my maths, it was down on the order of a-third or so for the first half of the year. And I'm just wondering overall \u2013 is the pace the facility's consolidation, do you think that's having a negative impact on Exelis revenue overall. It just looks like kind of everything is kind of coming down on that acquisition sales? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Pete, no, thank you. The NVCS business, we knew it'd be down this year. It's a little bit weaker than we thought. It's down probably in the double-digits now for the year. Early in the year, when I was guiding to our original down 3% to 5%, we were sizing NVCS to be down around 5% or 6% or sort of mid single-digit and it's got a little bit worse than that. Keep in mind, the Comm System business, 75% of that is international SINCGARS radios, some of that goes into the Middle East. So, they're also being impacted by the Middle East. But, we had contemplated it being a weaker year. Nigh vision broadly is $150 million business, it's flattish versus last year. So, we're holding serving night vision, but the Comm System business, certainly on a year-over-year basis is down a little bit worse than we had expected. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: And I don't think that the facility change in Fort Wayne is having any impact whatsoever on any of this transition. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Got it. Okay. And then just one follow-up on the aerostructure divestiture. Are you going to use the funds to repay debt or maybe offset dilution with share repurchases, I'd thinking you got about a little over $0.5 billion in debt coming view, that's current debt right now, and I'm just wondering if the plan is to pay all that off or, how are you thinking about all that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Our expectation is to use the proceeds from aerostructure to pay down debt. It's our expectation today. But, we don't really see the divestiture of aerostructures to be all that material to our guidance for the year in terms of EPS, it's a couple of pennies, but it's not material. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may begin. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. I wonder, we have the guidance for the segments for this year, but since they're new segments if you could talk maybe broadly or maybe just qualitatively at this point but how you think about margins progressing over time for each of these segments and where the targets are for this year relative to kind of what you might like to see? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I think you're seeing the page what's happening in the margins \u2013 in the guidance, we typically see quarter-to-quarter some fluctuations, Seth, and you saw as you went through some of the charts, some sequential deterioration, some businesses have been up or down, CN was actually quite strong on a sequential and a year-over-year basis because of mix, there's a lot of FAA work that's going in there offsetting decline in services as well as in CapRock. Things are moving around a little bit, but we'll see margins continuing to improve, going out into next year simply about base of better volume and also the integration savings are going to continue to roll through and we keep working hard to drive our normal OpEx agenda. So, we expect that we'll see margins improving. Right now, I think they're pretty strong this year in CS. You were guiding to 29.5% to 30.5%, so we're holding on that, and I do expect based on mix and the trends that we're seeing in the business that we could be towards the higher end of that. The SIS business is a government contracting business, while it's a little bit weaker in terms of margins that we expected before. It's pretty solid 15%, 15.5%, so that's I think very strong ES at 18% to 19%, is a very strong margin. That will be impacted over time by some changes in the mix of the programs, as we bring on newer programs and move off of legacy ones. So, we'll see some of the integration savings offset some of the mix. In CN, we're just battling right now, what's happening in the CapRock business and services. The FAA work in the international opportunities for mission, networks or FAA like opportunities, I think are going to help us there. So, I don't want to get too far out of fiscal 2016, in terms of margin guidance here, Seth, but that's where we stand right now for within the year. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's a helpful color. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, I'm not sure if we spoke instance the \u2013 since the budget year came out, it look like there might be some puts and takes for particular program. So, maybe just your thoughts on that and on what you \u2013 what we expected during the last year and the coming week? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I wish I had a crystal ball, what we're going to announce in the next week, but I really can't comment on that. But I think, from the fiscal 2016 basis, like others in the industry have been expressing, the two-year deal feels pretty good, it's good for Harris, it's good for the industry, we see what's happening in the DoD-based budget this year and next year. So, it's on a upswing, at least a little bit. I would say, I think, it's very positive. Now for Harris, in particular, I think we feel very good about our programs. The tactical radio line is that we typically pull from are well supported. Army modernization, we think is adequately covered, the FAA looks really good, and the NextGen programs were well funded in fiscal 2016. We're pleased to see funding for GPS III, which is an important Exelis program on SV 9 and SV 10. The weather programs were well supported and I'm glad to see the recent award come through very recently on the CrIS payloads for JPSS-3 and JPSS-4. F-35, where we've got a pretty large content for chipset, again we're seeing that ramp that was well supported. The addition of F-18 that aircraft into the budget, I think it was seven aircrafts or eight aircrafts was also good, because Exelis has an EW product line for the F-18. And again finally, OCO, we feel good about because of the amounts that are in there, which support some of the international FMS opportunities that were going after in our tactical business. So overall, I think, we feel pretty good about where the budget came out. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. You may begin. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : You mentioned that some of your products and service areas have continued to go through some revenue pressures, but I was wondering, in particularly in, let's say IT services for example, but I was wondering if your conversations with customers and bookings over the last quarter have indicated that it's getting less bad and then we can see a trough in these areas? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: On IT services, either we are \u2013 first of all, it was weaker than we thought it would be in the quarter. And I think as we've been talking about probably for the last three quarters or four quarters, we've been impacted by couple of sizeable program roll offs. We still see the overall procurement environment being relatively weak. We adjusted our full-year expectations for IT services. We came into the year thinking we'll be down mid-teens, it's now down probably in the 23%, 25% range over the course of the year, but we do see at least sequentially a stabilizing quarter-to-quarter going through the back end of fiscal 2016. Our book-to-bill in Q2 in the first half was reasonably good. It was over 1%, of course it's on a lower revenue environment, but the book-to-bill was pretty good, which again gets us encouraged that we can support some stability in the back half. We also have incumbent positions on some legacy programs that as the roll off start to ease, I think we'll see more stability in the back half. So, for the pipeline, that we had, we've got a very large pipeline of opportunities that we're chasing, it's actually come up a couple of billion from the beginning of the year, it's something like $24 billion now. We have within Harris, we've got to make sure that we improve our win rate. Our win rate is a little bit below what our target happens to be, we typically win into 23 percentage to 25 percentage, should be 30% or more. So, we're not winning quite as much as we need to be. A lot of that's really around our frontline execution in our process execution and we're getting that fixed. So, I do think rather a part of this is a slow environment and part of it is \u2013 what we need to do and improve our own win rate internally within the company. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. And then maybe the second question. You mentioned manpack and the DoD's timetables to get this done in Q1, assuming they stick to that, assuming you win something. When could be revenues from this award start to flow through? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We're not expecting revenue opportunities to really hit us until, really going into fiscal 2018, I mean it will be full rate production, if they stick to the current schedule. I believe it's in the middle of calendar 2017, so around June, which really means more significant revenue would impact our fiscal 2018, not 2017. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you so much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. You may begin. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Cart. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just, Bill, I wanted to come on \u2013 hit on the comments you made about the aerostructures' divestiture and the dispassionate approach you mentioned in your prepared remarks on the portfolio. I know you are probably right on the \u2013 about the time in the year where you're putting together your first strategic plan as a combined company and sort of wondering, what kind of qualifies as strategic and non-strategic at this point? Maybe just give us an update on how you think about what the various hurdles are to make a business strategically valuable to what you want Harris to look like with the Exelis in it as a combined entity? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, that's a very good question, Carter and you're right. We are getting into our strategic planning process and that will kind of inform a little bit more on what sort of portfolio we want over the long-term. So I wouldn't really comment about any specific business; but at the end of the day couple of things I would share with you. One, we are a technology-based company. We invest in new product development and we want to use technology to differentiate offerings in the marketplace. So, one of the key things that I look for are the things that the businesses that we want to be in should be able to be differentiated by providing some technology. We are also a mission-critical communication, defense, electronics-type company. So, for the aerostructures business, we have got these large composite skins and large factories with a lot of capital intensity. It really didn't necessarily fit with the rest of what we look like. So, I think that one as we came into the year and we're looking hard at which businesses should management focus its time and attention on on a continuum of businesses that go from very, very strategic like tactical radios on the far left to maybe less strategic on the far right being aerostructures, other businesses sit in the middle, and I'm using the criteria that I just described to assess which ones we should keep and which we should not. At the end of the day, does it fit strategically? Is it more valuable to us versus to somebody else? We look at performance of the company, performance of the business. All of those factors come into play in determining which ones we should keep and which ones we should not. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you have a bias, either government versus commercially leaning, at this point or it's agnostic to that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We're pretty agnostic. It's more about where \u2013 what businesses should we be in that we can bring some value to end customers, where we can apply technology, where we can differentiate our offering, where we can gain market share through differentiated offerings. All of those did develop \u2013 generate a very satisfactory return on investment in those businesses. Those are the things that we're looking at and they could be commercial or government. We see a big part of our business today is on the government side, we're very good at that, but that doesn't really drive the decision at the moment. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And just a couple of final clarifications on that. The Space and Intel margin revision, I wondered if you could give us some detail on what drove that since the revenue base is unchanged. And just some clarification on what you meant by bandwidth consolidation at CapRock and what that was meant to accomplish. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. On Space and Intel \u2013 thank you, Carter. On the Space and Intel side, really it's just a shifting mix of what's in the business, slightly more cost-plus and fixed-price contracts. And we're seeing some of the new starts and new wins that Space and Intel are getting are coming in at slightly lower margins. So, we just adjusted it down to reflect that. There's nothing structural in that business that's causing it. On the CapRock side, look \u2013 we \u2013 it's pretty remarkable the amount of bandwidth that's being consumed by the cruise industry and our expectations for where that's going to grow over time. It is growing very, very quickly. And with a very significant change in the supply structure of bandwidth \u2013 satellite bandwidth, we are able to use that leverage to both negotiate better details, better pricing and globally consistent pricing so that we don't have, for different types of satellites, for different customers in different regions, very different pricing. We're looking for pricing uniformity and that helps to run our business a little more efficiently and effectively and that's where we're heading on the bandwidth deal. So thank you for those questions, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Thanks, Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Sullivan with Sterne CRT. You may begin. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee CRT : Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee CRT : With Public Safety potentially turning a corner here, can you provide a little color on Harris' position with the FirstNet RFP? Are you teaming with anybody? Does it matter, can Harris sell with anybody who wins? Just a little color on that RFP and how Harris is positioned. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, thank you, Josh. Yeah. The RFP is out, which is good. We've been tracking this for several years and I think it's good news that it's out. We've met with the FirstNet board a couple of different times and we're pleased to see it out. There is a process that they've laid out. I think it's a little bit on the aggressive side. There is questions and capability assessments that are due coming up here in February and March. Bids are due on I think the 29th of April if they don't get extended. My expectation, at least what's come out in the RFP is a June award \u2013 a preliminary award in June and then it goes to the state consultation period for 90 days where the states have an opportunity to opt in or opt out and then after which whoever is the preliminary award winner would resubmit a new bid and with a final award by November of 2016. So that to me it's a pretty aggressive timeline. I think the RFP, Josh, feels like is geared more towards commercial carriers as primes, just by the way it's written and some of the requirements in the RFP. We are, as Harris, still assessing the role that we're going to play. Since it's a live competitive procurement I don't think we want to talk more about that, but we're in the middle of assessing the way which we want to participate in what could be a very interesting long-term opportunity that transforms the public safety networks in North America. Josh W. Sullivan - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Quilty with Raymond James. You may begin. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Question, it looks like the GPS OCX contract may come up for rebid. Can you talk about how that might impact you either positive or negative? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we're watching it very carefully. Chris, we're working diligently to support our prime customer, which is Raytheon, Raytheon is the prime on OCX. And I think you've read a lot in the press about some of the challenges in that program really around cyber security protections, which are causing the development timeframe to go quite long and obviously it's gotten a lot of attention on the hill with General Hayden, with Secretary James, there are lot of people that are focused on this as the team at Raytheon and we're working diligently to support Raytheon in their program and getting them back on schedule or at least hold into the schedule they've articulated, really not much more to say at this point on that. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And do you feel Harris' performance on that contract has been up to par? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's a legacy Exelis' program. We're built on the payload for GPS III so on the \u2013 for the payload side as well as on the ground sides putting Raytheon, and our understanding is our team has performed well. We bring good systems engineering capability and I think we performed well, you know to our customer, but I don't think I would suggest say more than that. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And I think Exelis' also had some issues on the GPS payload side, where do you stand in terms of resolving those issues? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. This was a \u2013 first of all, they're very complicated payload, it's a very difficult one, and the requirements were quite stringent, maybe they weren't fully understood many years ago, when Exelis won it \u2013 you know it was very late, you know it got a lot of attention, under Exelis they deployed a very good team at it, just for the end when we were buying the company. We have also deployed experts into the equipment facility, half a dozen or dozen, a very good people on manufacturing operations, design engineering, a lot of different things. And there's been, I think very good progress here made over the last six months to nine months. And over the holidays, just before the holidays, the very first space vehicle SV 1 with our payload came out of thermal vac early with very, very good performance. And it was \u2013 I think it's a fantastic accomplishment you know by Lockheed, by our team, by the Air Force, and we're all very, very proud of that. And I think that put us on a really good trajectory on GPS III on the space side, you know and that gives us more confidence with Lockheed that SV 9 and SV 10 should get awarded sometime this fiscal year. So, I think our performance has improved pretty much here, Chris. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Chris. And with that last question. Bill has a few wrap up comments and then, we'll close down the call. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Pam. And before we end the call, I want to take this opportunity to let you know that Mick Lopez has decided to leave Harris for personal reasons to pursue new opportunities outside the company. As you know, these last two years with Mick as CFO have been truly transformative for Harris, with the signing, the closing, the financing of the largest acquisition in our company's history, and I want to thank Mick for his leadership and his many contributions to Harris over the last two years. Mick, so thank you for that. Miguel A. Lopez - Harris Corp.: Thanks to you, Bill. I really appreciate your kind words. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: So, succeeding Mick will be Rahul Ghai. Rahul has led our Finance Integration Team since March of 2015. Rahul has a diverse finance background with experience in both commercial and aerospace industries, including executive leadership roles at both Aetna as well as United Technologies. A press release with more details will be issued momentarily. Please join me in wishing Mick well in his future endeavors and also welcoming Rahul to Harris as our new Chief Financial Officer. So, as usual Pam will be available throughout the day to address any additional questions that you might have and I want to thank you again for joining our call today. So, thank you. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you, everyone. Let me know how I can help. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise. But later on, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session; instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to introduce your first speaker for today, Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. You have the floor. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett, and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And first, before we get started, few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information on a related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation on Harris' SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. And with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Third quarter results were solid with operational earnings benefiting from the continuing ramp in synergy savings. Total company orders and revenue were sequentially higher and book-to-bill was a very strong 1.12, driven by Space & Intelligence Systems, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks. We delivered good bottom-line results despite the impact of lower tactical radio revenue from the Middle East, demonstrating that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. Looking to the full year, and the now slower pace in the Middle East, together with a DOD tactical radio opportunity that has slipped into next year, we're adjusting our fiscal 2016 earnings per share guidance to about $5.70, the bottom end of the prior range on revenue of about $7.5 billion. Rahul will provide more color in a minute, but the only segment that's changing is Communication Systems where we're now expecting legacy tactical revenue to be down high single-digits with similar declines in both international and DOD. So let me start with a little color on what's driving the change. We started the year anticipating Harris legacy international a flat to down, even though we were coming off several years of strong expansion in international, including a record fiscal 2015. But at the time, we had started to see some opportunities in the Middle East market stretch out a bit. The first half of the year played out about as we thought with international revenue up 5%, including higher revenue from the Middle East as a result of strong FMS funding support. And while we were expecting a year-over-year back half decline in the Middle East, we anticipated sequential revenue growth. But the combination of fiscal pressures and funding priorities, both in country and with the U.S. government, as well as a slow FMS approval process, have shifted opportunities to the right. We believe the slow pace in the Middle East is temporary. Security issues and the need for more capable tactical communications are unchanged and the FMS funding support remains strong for the region with additional money earmarked in the GFY 2017 President's Budget request. In the U.S. tactical market, while our book-to-bill was above one in the quarter, MUOS upgrade opportunities expected in fiscal 2016 are now unlikely to begin before the end of the year. While the MUOS capability is designed into our new two-channel Manpack for the U.S. Army, we've also adapted the waveform so that could be easily ported through a simple download into our 117G radios, 30,000 of which are currently fielded in DOD inventory. We've demonstrated connectivity between our radio and the satellite. We're on track to receive NSA certification shortly, and customers across several services are anxious to benefit from the mobility and higher bandwidth that the MUOS constellation provides. This is a very real and compelling value proposition for our customers and funding for this opportunity has been earmarked in GFY 2016. We anticipate this funding converting to an order for Harris before the end of September. So while fiscal 2016 is a bit softer than expected in Tactical Communications, our outlook is solid and our competitive position has never been stronger. In the DOD, we've won or have a position on every major tactical radio contract awarded in the last five years. The mid-tier radio, MNVR, won in 2013, the Rifleman Radio won last year, the SOCOM two-channel handheld won earlier this year, and most recently, the very large HMS Manpack awarded in February. These are all significant wins for Harris, so let me update you on the latest developments. After more than four years of tenacious effort, the Army awarded Harris a 10-year, $12.7 billion IDIQ contract for the multi-channel Manpack radio, opening a market for Harris which had previously been closed to competition. Qualification and customer tests are starting soon and scheduled to wrap up by the end of our fiscal 2017, with the initial production delivery order award currently scheduled in early fiscal 2018. The $3.7 billion Rifleman Radio procurement is also progressing well. We've now completed both qualification and customer tests, receiving positive feedback on operational capabilities such as range and battery life. An initial production delivery order is expected in the second half of fiscal 2017. SOCOM's modernization is also moving forward and a protest of Harris' single award for the $390 million two-channel handheld radio program was recently resolved in our favor and work has begun. Product deliveries begin in the first half of fiscal 2018. This radio features both communications and ISR capabilities and since SOCOM has long been an early adopter of cutting-edge technology that eventually find its way into the broader DOD and international militaries, it positions us well to compete on a number of other modernization programs. The handheld is part of a broader modernization program that SOCOM has said could reach $900 million and include a new Manpack and HF radio. The Manpack RFP is expected late this summer and contract award before the end of fiscal 2017 with the HF radio following sometime thereafter. On the international front, the pipeline remains about $2.9 billion, and is diverse in terms of regions, countries and customers within the country. And while the near-term velocity has slowed a bit in the Middle East, continued progress is being made elsewhere. In the last earnings call, we mentioned that a $600 million opportunity for Australia's Phase 3 modernization had moved into the pipeline, with an award expected by the end of fiscal 2017. We've now been selected as the preferred supplier, with a significantly broader scope where Harris will now prime to deliver an integrated solution. This is a key part of our long-term growth strategy in international to expand our addressable market, leverage capabilities from across Harris and evolve from a radio supplier to now providing entire systems. Turning to a few highlights in other areas of the company, both Space & Intel and Electronic Systems had strong orders, higher sequential and a year-over-year organic revenue and book-to-bill greater than one. Approximately 70% of Exelis' legacy business reside in these two segments and contributed to the positive sales and orders trend. In Space & Intel, awards from classified customers totaled $329 million, with continued strong budget support for intelligence programs and the ongoing customer focus on space superiority and protection capabilities. On the commercial space side, there are signs of a recapitalization cycle and fleet expansions beginning, and we recently received a $37 million order to provide an 18-meter unfurlable antenna reflector for the JCSAT-17 geostationary communications satellite. The prospects in our space antenna business are stronger today than they've been in the last decade. Within Electronic Systems, we enjoyed another quarter of strong electronic warfare bookings, including $88 million to supply electronic jammers for the F/A-18 aircraft, an excellent example of modernization opportunities on existing platforms with a very long tail. Electronic warfare is now on track in fiscal 2016 to double orders over the prior year and end the year with about $200 million higher backlog. Strong free cash flow generation and deleveraging remain top priorities for Harris and at the end of the third quarter, year-to-date free cash flow stood at $425 million, supporting expectations for the year of $750 million. On April 8, we completed the sale of Aerostructures and used the cash proceeds to pay down debt. So less than a year after closing the Exelis acquisition, we repaid $683 million of term loan debt, which is approximately one-third of the total debt we've committed to repaying over three years. So now, before turning the call over to Rahul Ghai, our new Chief Financial Officer, to cover the detailed financial results and guidance, I want to provide a brief introduction. As you already know, Rahul joined Harris in March of 2015 to lead the finance integration team and was named CFO in early February. By leading the finance integration team over the last year, Rahul has been essential to our integration success and has provided a smooth and natural transition to CFO. Rahul and I worked closely together for five of his 12 years at United Technologies, and again, over the past year, as we've integrated Exelis. I'm confident in Rahul's ability to lead the Harris' finance organization and be a true business partner to me and to the rest of the management team. So Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Before starting, I'd like to remind you that our discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. Now, turning to third quarter results and slide three in the presentation. EPS was $1.45 with acquisition savings supporting operating performance and benefiting from a lower than expected tax rate in the quarter. Reported revenue was $1.91 billion compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year. On an organic basis, revenue was down 3%. Strong revenue growth in Space & Intelligence Systems and Electronic Systems was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and International Tactical, in both legacy Harris and Exelis. Sequentially, revenue was up 3.6% with higher revenue across three of our four segments, with the exception of Communication Systems where revenue was less than one point lower than revenue in the second quarter. EBIT margin for the company held strong at 16.4%, driven by excellent margin performance across all segments and reflecting continuing focus on driving integration savings and lowering costs across the company. Orders in the quarter were $2.1 billion, bringing year-to-date book-to-bill to 1.06 for the company and was greater than one in each segment in the third quarter with the exception of Communication Systems. Within Communication Systems, third quarter book-to-bill for Tactical Communications was 0.8 with legacy Harris business at 0.83. And in the supplemental pages of the presentation, we have included historical order and backlog detail for legacy Harris tactical business. Public safety book-to-bill was a bit disappointing at 0.5 and reflects that while the business is slowly improving, with revenue up 15% in the quarter, we're not beyond the choppiness. In Space & Intelligence, orders strength continued in the classified area. In Electronic Systems, orders were strong in electronic warfare and also in avionics where we received $121 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35. In Critical Networks, FAA funding was a significant driver and both CapRock energy and maritime reported book-to-bill of more than one. For Harris overall, awards are on track to achieve a book-to-bill of one or close to one for the year. So turning to segment detail on slide four and comparisons to prior year pro forma results, as Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal 2015. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $485 million and down 10%. Tactical Communications revenue was down 16% and public safety was up 15% compared to prior year. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower revenue in Middle East for both Harris and Exelis legacy businesses and completion of Australia's Phase 2 modernization program. Operating income was $154 million and operating margin was a strong 31.8%. Turning to Space & Intelligence Systems on slide five. Third quarter revenue was $489 million and up 7% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including programs in space superiority. Operating income in the third quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 15.5%. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded $81 million in follow-on contracts with $26 million order to sustain ground-based systems that support U.S. missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions from the Air Force for the SENSOR program. Turning to Electronic Systems on slide six. Third quarter revenue was $393 million and up 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from the F-35 program and counter IED systems was partially offset by lower revenue from Commercial Broadband Satellite Program terminals. Operating income in the third quarter was $75 million and operating margin was excellent at 19.1%. Just following the close of the quarter, we completed the sale of Aerostructures, which was part of the Exelis acquisition and reported within Electronic Systems. While not material to Harris, we have included historical financial informations of Aerostructures for fiscal 2015 and 2016 in the supplemental section of the presentation. Turning to Critical Networks on slide seven. Third quarter revenue was $551 million and down 10% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services from the wind-down of two major programs and lower revenue in CapRock's energy market. Operating income in the third quarter was $59 million and operate margin was 10.7%. So moving to slides eight and nine. Total company revenue guidance on an organic basis is revised from down 5% to 6% to down about 7%, driven by lower revenue in Communication Systems. The impact of lower revenue is expected to be partially offset by cost savings across the company and lower taxes. As a result, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be approximately $5.70 the lower end of the previous guidance range. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down between 8% to 9% with Harris legacy tactical down high single-digits. With lower volume for the year, operating margin is expected to be about 29% (sic) [29.5%] in the segment, which is at the lower end of the previous range. In Electronic Systems, expectations remain unchanged with the exception of removing Aerostructures for the remainder of the year. With Aerostructures removed, revenue is revised to a range of down 3% to 4% and is equivalent to the previous organic expectations of down 2% to 3%. Operating margin is unchanged at 18% to 19%. And in Space & Intelligence and Critical Networks, expectations remain unchanged. The expected tax rate for fiscal 2016 has been revised from 32.5% to 31%, due to international tax settlements for prior years and from integration steps that have lowered state taxes. Beyond fiscal 2016, we expect to benefit from lower state taxes and now permanent R&D tax credit. So let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, thank you, Rahul. A little less than a year ago, we closed on Exelis, a truly transformational acquisition for our company. We're executing well on the integration and our results are benefiting from synergy capture. From day one of integration, we've been tracking a little ahead of schedule in reaching integration targets, which is a great achievement from the team. So as we maneuver through pockets of revenue softness, it's evident that the added scale of the Exelis acquisition has broadened our business and is contributing to improved operating resiliency. With less than a year into the acquisition, achieving our current expectation of about 11% earnings growth is a good outcome. Looking ahead, we expect fiscal 2016's rising trend in earnings to continue into fiscal 2017, supported by higher synergy savings and other cost reduction actions. In the meantime, we'll continue to gain traction in our multi-year strategy to successfully integrate Exelis, lower costs and deliver accretion, shape our business portfolio, drive strong free cash flow and deleverage, all while still investing in technology and new product development to drive future growth. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hi, good morning, guys. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey Bill, I guess on the Australian contract, it seems like one of the largest radio contracts you guys have won as far as I remember. Is that through the protest period I guess number one? And number two, how much of a growth driver can that be for you in fiscal 2017? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first off is we've been named the preferred supplier, but haven't won the award yet. We expect the contract award to occur sometime late in our fiscal 2017, which means revenue from that opportunity extends into and begins in fiscal 2018. So it's still on the horizon. We are very well-positioned, being officially notified by the Australian MOD that we're the preferred supplier, it's a very, very important step in the contract negotiation phase, but we do expect that award to happen sometime in the late of our fiscal 2017. It's very big and we're very pleased with our progress there. And again, it's a key part of our long-term strategy to grow from a radio supplier to now a system supplier. We've talked about that for the last few years. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Oka, that's great. Is it fair to say that $2.9 billion international pipeline still includes Australia in it? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes, it does. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. And just last one, I know we're still a quarter out, but directionally, in fiscal 2017, can you give us a sense of your outlook for communications just given its importance? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first of all, we're not going to provide today any guidance. We're not \u2013 we'll come to that in early August. But I think when you talk about communications, you sound \u2013 your question seems more directed towards the tactical side, which, as we know, has been more of the important earnings driver. So we're not going to provide some guidance today, but there are several things that are on our radar screen that we'd like to see happen in the near term that will help to shape some of the guidance we'll provide in early August. In the DOD side, both MUOS and the MNVR radio, the mid-tier radio, together will contribute to higher earnings, higher revenue in fiscal 2017. MUOS, which did slip out of the quarter, we expect to receive certifications on that this summer, NSA certification. We've already demonstrated on air performance of both voice and data. It's well supported. Funds are allocated. And it's a very strong and compelling business case and we're very confident that's going to happen over the next several months. On the mid-tier side, on the MNVR, that will be in the tens of millions of dollars. It's well supported in the President's Budget request, as well is in the NDAA that just came out. The network assessment is going on as we speak. And we expect a production award towards the end of the government fiscal year 2016, so around the September timeframe. I think on the international side, which has become a bigger part of our business and it's a very large pipeline, we're looking at what's occurring in Eastern Europe and the Ukraine where we've been very, very strong in fiscal 2016. We need that to continue. We need to see the opportunities that we've seen very well in Iraq in fiscal 2016. We expect that to continue at the same level as we see in 2016, and again, opportunities in Iraq, to us, as we speak today, seem to be well supported. One of the opportunities in the international that slipped out of fiscal 2016 into 2017 is in Iraq, but it's well-funded. We think that that's going to happen in 2017. There's another country in the Middle East we can't name where an opportunity did slip out and we expect that will happen in early 2017 as well. And then, finally, in Central Asia, meaning specifically Afghanistan, we've had a very strong year this year. Opportunities there seem well supported. And we do expect Afghanistan, and more broadly, Central Asia, to be the strong contributor to revenue into next year. Now, outside of Tactical Communications, we have a broader \u2013 outside of legacy tactical, we've a broader communications business, including Exelis, the radio business from Exelis, which is mostly international. We've been tracking an opportunity in Saudi Arabia for quite some time. It's about $40 million, $50 million in size for SINCGARS radios for vehicles. It's been hung up in the Saudi Royal Court for a number of months, and we need that to break free as we get into 2017 as well. So maybe, Pete, just a little bit of shape and color around what we expect going into next year. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. I appreciate it very much. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure, Pete. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: So to follow up on Pete's question, when we look at the absolute level of backlog at legacy tactical, $419 million, it's a pretty low level, obviously, that captures domestic and foreign. Why should we not be concerned about another down year in fiscal 2017 at tactical RF? Or are you willing to say directionally it's going to be flat, up, down? What's your sense, because a lot of what you talked about look like fiscal 2018 sales opportunities? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, most of what I talked... Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: (24:32). William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, yeah, we're not going to comment yet on 2017 in the shape up, down, flat at this point. We provided some additional information on the backlog in the document. I know some of the math that some of the analysts have done on funded backlog. Where we're at today? It's low, it's lowest as it's been in sometime. As we look out over the next 12 months and how much is covered in backlog, it's not all that different from where we were about a year ago. But we do see a number of things that are materializing both in the DOD as well as in the international side much of which we do expect over the course of next year and it's good to see a lot of the international opportunities backstop by throwing a funding support within the U.S. DOD and state department funds. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Can you give us any color on the upcoming quarters? Do you expect book-to-bill to be \u2013 you're implying about $300 million of legacy tactical RF revenue in Q4. Do you anticipate that bookings will exceed that or coming below that? And how is it shaping in fiscal Q1? You mentioned MNVR might actually get an award in the September quarter. Are there any other items you can point to, to help us kind of calibrate to what we should expect in the next couple of quarters? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, Gautam, over the course of Q4, we expect to end the year with funded backlog in Tactical in line with Q3 or slightly up. So we do expect to see some decent awards in Q4 about at the level of revenue. So we don't see another step down in backlog at this point, but in line with where we are in Q3. We're not anticipating or providing any guidance on Q1 in the 2017, although we are watching very carefully the network assessment. The funding for MNVR is in the 2016 budget. There's money allocated in the 2017 PBR. It seems to be protected in the NDAA that came out of HASC at about $20 million, $25 million. And we do anticipate a production award occurring in the September timeframe. That could drive revenue beyond that; it may not be in Q1, but we do think that that's going to end up occurring as we get into 2017. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And last two, sorry. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Australia, is it still $600 million with the expanded scope in the pipeline? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. The scope of our work hasn't changed from what we've been communicating before. And this has been in the discussions with the Australian MOD for several years. We've got a very strong group of partners with us. We have a very well-defined scope providing a broader system with radios and it remains about $600 million. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And last one, and I'll turn it over, HMS Manpack, when is the final down select to two? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we expect the customer test for the Manpack to occur between January and May of 2017, and we expect the first delivery order with an August of 2017 decision and delivering around October of 2017. That is our expectation. As we've said before, we see the Manpack as a revenue driver in fiscal 2018 not in fiscal 2017. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So the MUOS slip, is it possible to quantify how much revenue that took out of the fiscal 2016 revenue outlook today? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. It's in the tens of millions of dollars that slipped beyond Q4 into Q1, Q2. It's possible to receive the order late this quarter. It more likely is in Q1 of our fiscal 2017. Over time, it's a pretty substantial opportunity; it's across a number of different services, and we feel very, very good about the capability. As I said in my prepared remarks, the business case on that is really very, very compelling, and we've demonstrated on-air performance of the 117G with MUOS already, and I think it's a great opportunity for us and we're confident it's going to go forward. It may not happen this quarter. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. I guess, I'm sort of wondering more broadly, when I looked at the revenue outlook reduction, especially in Comm Systems, kind of, how much of that is general softness across many areas, especially international versus the prior forecast, as opposed to it being one or two or three bigger specific items that slipped into 2017? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, it really comes into three specific opportunities. One is MUOS on the DoD side, which again is tens of millions and drop the guidance down to high single-digits for the DoD side tactical radio in fiscal 2016. That did slip to the right, but we're very confident that's going to happen. On the international side, we saw two opportunities slip to the right. One is in Iraq. It does have funding, but we do expect that to be a first half 2017 event, not in Q4 of 2016. And the other is an opportunity for another country in the Middle East, which we can't name. The funding for that opportunity has been reprioritized, but the customer is working with us on a number of other projects, which we believe will be funded in the first half of our fiscal 2017. So it's relatively isolated to three different specific opportunities that generally just moved out of the quarter. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. That's really helpful. On slide 10 where you've given this historical data on Harris legacy Tactical, you've broken out revenue by domestic and international. Can you tell us what orders were by domestic and international in the quarter? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we're going to stick with the splitting of the revenue for right now, but I would say that the relative mix, Noah, of the ending backlog, between international and DoD is reflective of the balance between international and DoD in the revenue base. So kind of on the order of two-thirds, one third \u2013 international, two thirds; DoD, one third. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And why not give those order numbers on that slide? Just competitively or...? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's just something that we're not necessarily prepared to provide today. We'll give that some more thought over the \u2013 for the next call that we have, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. It would be helpful. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then what were \u2013 specifically, what was the book-to-bill in the other segments where you've quantified it as being over one, can you tell us how far over one or specifically what they were by segment? It sounds like they were pretty good. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes, we were at about in the Space & Intelligence business just over 1.3. In the Electronic Systems business, we were at about 1.25, and in the CN business, we were at 1.21. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On the Manpack award, some of your competitors have been talking about what they have to offer there. I was wondering if you could frame for us where you think Harris is positioned and why you think you're going to win. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we think we've got a very, very strong and compelling offering. We've been working on it for a number of years. We have a very strong, very high share today in the Manpack market within the U.S. DOD and we've developed I think a very good radio in a very large factory where we've got tremendous scale that through the R&D investments we're able to continue to bring features and functionality of the radio over time and use our scale to make sure we're competitive on the cost side. So we think we've got a very, very strong offering for the Manpack. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, secondly, you highlighted the debt repayment year-to-date, and you're about a third of the way to your target. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : What do you think the profile of debt repayment will be going forward from here? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Good morning. This is Rahul. So we think we had said that we will be about $2 billion in the first three years. So we are tracking to that, and in the first quarter of our fiscal 2017 or just after the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we have about $250 million of debt repayment on one of the old Exelis notes that we will prepay. So I would say between, so it may be a little bit kind of the same pattern between 2017 and 2018 and we'll evaluate as we get into fiscal 2017 if we need to alter that, but I would just spread that equally between 2017 and 2018 at this point. Maybe a little bit lower in 2017 and more in 2018. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: What we said is that also over the next three years, we'll bring our leverage ratio down into the 1.5 range and we're tracking well towards that. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, just a final one from me, I was wondering if you could size how large your Middle Eastern export sales are in the Communications division? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Middle East for us and broadly Middle East North Africa is about 40%, 45% of our international tactical business. Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Your line is open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, Bill. I wanted to address maybe a strategic question. You talk about continuing to optimize the business portfolio. Clearly, the sale of the Aerostructures business was spectacular outcome, but optimize means lots of different things. So could you elaborate on that please? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, we feel very good about where we ended on the Aerostructures business and completing the sale in early April. It's on top of what we did last year on the Commercial Healthcare business and before that Broadcast. So I think we've been \u2013 I think pretty dispassionate and pretty aggressive in looking at what is in our portfolio, what strategically fits, what's a better value to Harris versus to an outside party. We also look at the performance of the underlying business. That's actually an important factor, but Howard, as I step back, we are at the heart a technology-based company, really in defense electronics, mission-critical communications. And we want to be in businesses where technology is a discriminator, add some competitive advantage. We spend quite a bit on IRAD, more than 4% as well above our peers, 4% of our revenue. We have about 40% of our population are engineers or scientists and we want to be in businesses where technology can allow us to win and that's a key factor in how we evaluate the portfolio. We've been, again, aggressive and doing something with Aerostructures, and we continue to look at what's in our base to that broader business that we have today. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : That makes a lot of sense. And then, just to build on that, can you talk \u2013 we can see the cost synergies from Exelis. Can you talk about a little bit on the sales synergies or where your \u2013 where the organization is able to go to market with a package that can somehow accelerate some growth? I mean you did \u2013 just to finish on that, you did a nice job I think of outlining what you're doing in radios, but the other markets are very large as well and important as we look at that (37:28). William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, our focus has been, Howard, really around the cost take-out and we've done I think a very good job. We get at it very, very quickly. And we still feel good about hitting our run rate savings as we exit 2017 in that $140 million, $150 million net range, which is more aggressive than we thought. We're closing about 15% of our floor space and that's tracking very, very well. So that has been our number one focus. And that's how we justified the acquisition was really on cost take-out. On the revenue side, yeah, we've got our teams really focused on this. Dana Mehnert who's been over here at Harris for more than 30 years and really built our tactical radio business into what it is today, has now taken on a role as Head of Global Business Development, really with an eye towards how do we grow in major markets around the world where the opportunities might be a little bit outside of the horizon or between businesses or might involve bringing together, strapping together some technology from Exelis with Harris and his focus is really on that. And it's across the gamut, it's across technology, across platforms, across geographies or channels to market. In all of those things, we're starting to see some opportunities. And as we get beyond this year and start to shape 2017, we'll talk a bit more about where they start to \u2013 where we're starting to see those opportunities come to fruition. What I'd rather do is talk about the ones that we are actually achieving as we achieved them as opposed to speculating about where they might be. One last point on this, Howard, because I think this is very important and I want to make sure investors don't miss this, it's not just about applying common technology is going after channels. The part of what we're doing in driving operational excellence and integration into cross Exelis is improving program performance. This is very important. The best way to grow a business is performing well on what you're doing today. And in the note that in Rahul's prepared remarks, he talked about the SENSOR program. The SENSOR program was being recompeted, because the performance wasn't quite up to snuff with the Air Force and through a lot of work, the on-time delivery of that program has improved dramatically, and now, we're starting to get awards back on SENSOR and the competition has been canceled going to one of the pieces of SENSOR because of the improved performance. So I feel that we just keep focused on performance and executing very, very well, that will help us grow our business into the future as well. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : And then, one last item. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : You've got again, sort of focused on the top-line a little bit. You've got an enormous amount of data you provide to the FAA and some of that can be remarketed and sold in a value-added manner. How far along are you with that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, our focus right now with the FAA is executing on NextGen programs and FAA today is probably our largest customer. We're on four or five NextGen programs and, of course, we've got the FTI, the telecommunications infrastructure that we're working on. But through Exelis, they had the ADS-B network more than 640 radio towers operating very well long-term contract with the FAA very strong position, and they have unique access to data and that data can be used in other forms for other uses including supporting the integration of UAVs into the North American air traffic control system that is a key part of our strategy. That's an opportunity, it's likely beyond the next couple three-year planning horizon, but clearly, through both technology partnerships and legislation, all of which need to be worked on today to make sure we've got a strong position there over time. So Howard, that is an important focus of ours, and as we get clearer around what our particular strategies there, we'll share that more with investors that's a little bit beyond the planning horizon. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much, Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure, Howard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Bill, and welcome Rahul. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Maybe this horse isn't quite dead yet, so I'll beat it again. But I want to talk tactical really quickly, and I know you're not ready to provide 2017 guidance, but you talked about several of these opportunities, which clearly layer in later in next fiscal year and beyond, and you made a comment in your prepared remarks in the closing remarks about sort of short-term movements in revenue. But when you look at that business on a long-term trend line basis, is it your expectation that that trend line is upward sloping when we look out over the next two years, three years, five years because of all of the opportunities that we've been looking at and you've executed on in recent years? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, I think it's a good question, Carter, and clearly, on the DOD side, I think the answer is yes. It is clearly on an upward slope, and I think as I went into some detail on the programs that we won on the DOD side. And the fact that even in the President's Budget, they're well-supported in the DOD, they're well-supported, the procurements are moving forward at a reasonable pace. I feel very confident that the DOD business will be a growth driver for us, certainly, as we get into 2018 and beyond. 2017 is a little bit too soon to call. I do see it coming off the bottom in 2016, in 2017, but I think 2018 is really the growth year, and I think it really relates to the flow in from some of these modernization programs where we're very, very well-positioned including in SOCOM. So the DOD, I think, clearly is a growth driver. On the international side, we've seen fantastic growth over the last few years. We've seen a little bit of softness this year. The pipeline is still very robust. We are still well-positioned. Competitively, we're very strong. Where we are going out to compete, we win almost all the places that we are competing in around the world where we have a position. I think the opportunity in Australia where we become the preferred supplier for a very large contract, which include systems and products, it's an important part of our strategy, because we need to increase the size of the addressable market we're going after in international in order to continue to see growth in that international base over time. But I do see on the DOD side, yes, that that will be a longer-term growth market for us. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And on a couple others, just looking at the bookings trend and the revenue trend at CapRock, does that business look like it's bottomed now from your perspective? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I think the good news, Carter, is that we haven't adjusted in our outlook for 2016. We haven't changed it based on what's going on in the CapRock business. The energy business is still under a lot of pressure. I know oil prices have recovered a little bit, but still well down. A lot of the energy majors are reporting some pretty terrible numbers right now. For the year, we still expect CapRock energy to be down about 25%. We were down in the 20% range-ish in the first half; it will be worse than that, obviously, in the second half. As we get into Q4, we see the revenue in Q4 in CapRock energy to be on the order of about $60 million in the quarter. So if you just annualize that, you're sort of around $240 million for the year as we exit fiscal 2016. And for perspective, in fiscal 2016 overall, revenue in CapRock energy was around $290 million. So the math would imply that we'll see a little bit of another downturn on an annual basis in 2017 over 2016. 2016, again, is down about 25% from fiscal 2015. So we are seeing another step-down as we get into next year, but it's not different than what we described last time and built into our guidance for this year. I guess, as you saw, the CN margins were down a little bit sequentially. We did lose money in energy in Q3, but we've done quite a bit of restructuring as we laid out to investors back in February, and we do expect the energy business to go back to profitability in Q4, and be less of a profit driver as we get into fiscal 2017. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: When you say less of a profit driver, you (46:13). William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Less of an impact on profit. Yes, exactly. Yes. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, one final one, just a clarification. The increase in the synergies clearly benefits the fourth quarter this year, but does that imply any change to the run rate synergy target on Exelis that you laid out before or this is just faster capture? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's faster capture. We still expect to be at $140 million, $150 million net \u2013 $140 million to $150 million net of what we give back to the government, as we exit fiscal 2017. So it's really just a faster capture this year at $80 million, $85 million. We see next year, in year fiscal 2017, integration savings or synergy savings in the $130 million to $135 million range, Carter. So that implies an extra $50 million in the in-year 2017 from 2016. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Carter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I have to apologize in advance for asking another 2017 question, but not in terms of numbers, but just very broadly, outside of Communications, when we think about the DoD budget and investment account outlays should be up pretty nicely in government fiscal 2017 when we think about Space and Electronics, and let's say, Critical Networks putting CapRock aside, with DoD investment account outlays growing nicely, is there any reason to expect that any of those segments won't grow? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we see very good trends through the year in our Space business as well as in the Electronic Systems business. It's kind of encouraging to be through the year here in Space and pretty good backlog growth, pretty good book-to-bill through the year, same thing on the Electronic Systems business. It's good to see electronic warfare to be pretty strong, it turns out, over the course of the year and ending a couple of hundred million dollars higher in backlog. At least that bodes well for not another step-down as we get into 2017. But yeah, the budgets look pretty good. There's still a long way to go between where we are today and appropriations bills. But we feel pretty good about the overall outlook. The only cautionary points I would give is on CapRock. We do see again another step down as we get into 2017, just based on where the exit rate happens to be. In our Mission Sustainment business, which was down this year in the 20%, 22%, 23% range mainly because of a couple of big program roll-offs, we've got some work to do there to make sure that we hold that business as we go into next year. It's a very, very competitive landscape. We have about a third of that business that's up for recompete. As we go into next year, the Mission Sustainment or Services business, and we've got to do a little bit of work to make sure that we win on those recompetes. It's something that this management team is pretty well focused on today. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up on cash flow, you maintain the free cash flow guidance for the year, but the CapEx guidance came down. I was wondering if you can talk about the driver there? I mean, was it basically that the uppers in the EPS guidance were kind of non-cash versus the decline in the Communications revenue? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, you still got a pretty big jump in the CapEx in Q4 and what specifically is driving that? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So \u2013 yes, you're right. I mean there's no change to our fiscal 2016 guidance on cash flow. Reduction in CapEx is basically offsetting the change in earnings. So, that's where \u2013 that's kind of the math we're doing. We still need to get the working capital improvement in the fourth quarter to get to our full year number, but historically, 50% of our cash flow for the year has come in the fourth quarter, and this year we're expecting slightly less than that. So we feel good about that. I mean we have some projects going on and the timing of CapEx kind of differs from quarter-to-quarter and there's just variability within the quarter. So we have some projects going on that need some step-up in CapEx, but we've calculated our outlook for the year. And we think we'll be close to that number that we've guided to. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We feel pretty good, Seth, about the progress we've made over the last several years and just making ourselves a little more capital efficient, and it includes the approval thresholds in the company. On a pro forma basis, a couple of years ago, the companies together would've been around $260 million, $270 million or in the range of 3% of sales and this year, we'll be about 2.3%. We still see some opportunities to continue to be a little more judicious on capital spending going forward. So we feel pretty good about where we stand so far this year in capital. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Operator, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. This last question is from the line of Chris Quilty from Raymond James. Your line is open. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Bill, just a follow-up on Australia, and the focus on systems. Can you give us an idea of what you end up bundling in, in a system sale in addition to radios and what kind of a revenue multiplier or, I mean does it increase the size of the potential order by 10% or 15% or double it? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, the radios would also include a lot of antenna systems, it's the battle management system, the software systems. There is a variety of other things that we package in to a systems offering to a customer. Every end market is going to be a little bit different. We've had $700 million with a systems opportunity being booked and sold in other markets in the past. If I member right on those markets, because I don't want to talk specifically about Australia, it's probably in the order of around maybe two to ones, with two parts of non-radios to one part radios, in other words, about a third of the opportunity would be radios, thereabouts, and the two-thirds would be other things you package around that. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And when you look at your opportunity pipeline down the road, broadly, what percent of those international opportunities might you convert to more of a systems versus a traditional radio sale? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. It's a good question. It's something we've been working on for quite some time in the U.S. The U.S. military tends to do their own systems integration. They manage each of the suppliers and the components and then integrate it together, and then test it through what we're seeing today in these network evaluations, these NIEs. On the international side, more and more customers are moving towards buying an installed solution, an integrated solution, and that's I think a good trend and that's heading in our direction. We feel very good that the radio itself is very, very competitive and provides a key source of value and we think we can broaden that and bring other partners on to our team, and in fact, that's exactly what we've been able to do in Australia. Some very important large global players are on the Harris team in Australia, providing components to us. And what that does is it not just provides the radio, but software and other components around that, it does continue to build more stickiness into that and customer coming back to Harris Corporation over time. So we feel very good about the trajectory we happen to be on, on the systems and integrated solutions side internationally. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And who would be your big competitors that are adopting the same approach? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I don't like to get into the competitor, because some of the competitors have found their way on to our team in Australia, and it really varies by market. But I would just say that we've got a lineup of very good suppliers, good partners with us in Australia, and again, we go compete against different people in different markets. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And a clarification on the MUOS, is that a one-time revenue opportunity on the software upgrade or is there any kind of tail? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, there's going to be a \u2013 we've been investing quite a bit of IRAD into developing the ability to easily port this MUOS waveform into 117Gs. It sounds more simple in the way I explain it than it really was. It was quite a bit of magic to make this happen and not require any sort of firmware, hardware change out for these radios which I think is absolutely amazing, amazing what the team has done. And what we're now doing is working with our service partners to provide them software licenses that would allow them to once they buy the license to then download that software into their radios, into the 117Gs. As that MUOS waveform is changed or advanced over time, there may be opportunities for that to kind of get readvanced or other licenses or other opportunities revenue opportunities to occur. But we see that, over time, this is a pretty substantial opportunity, and I think as each service picks it up will drive some revenue event for us on MUOS. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And just a final follow-up question. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: You said the outlook on your reflector businesses, the best you've seen in 10 years and yet last year was a pretty crappy year for Commercial SATCOM orders and this year is not looking any better year-to-date. So is that primarily reflecting just a higher value for the type of and reflectors that you're developing or is it a market share gain? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: No, I think what we're seeing here is over the last five years, in our business that we've got, as you know, a pretty high share of the hoop reflector or space reflector market. We've only sold two commercial reflectors. So far we have this JCSAT order for $37 million. We have four proposals out. We have 15 prospects in the pipeline and what's driving this, Chris, our new entrance, it's the increase in high throughput satellites. It's recapitalizations. It's a surge that is occurring in small sats for both the U.S. government as well as the commercial sector. We see that as a pretty good opportunity in the near to medium-term and it's both on the reflectors side as well as sensors and payloads for these other small sats, both again commercial and U.S. government. So I think we're on the front end of what it appears to be a recap cycle and we feel it's a very important recent event, and again, with the prospects we see and the proposals we have out, we will feel pretty good about this business, Chris. Chris D. Quilty - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program and you now disconnect your telephone lines at this time.

Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Pamela Padgett, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. I am Pamela Padgett. On the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information on a related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation on Harris', SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly material on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call is also available. And with that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everybody. Overall, fiscal 2016 was a solid year, and I am pleased with our performance. Earnings per share increased 11% to $5.70 and organic revenue down 7%. Operating margins were up 60 basis points to 16.2% and free cash flow was strong at $772 million. Book-to-bill was greater than 1. And we executed well against the key priorities we set out at the beginning of the year. First was, successfully integrated Exelis, a company which added scale, a broader portfolio of technologies, new market opportunities and improved operating resilience and moving faster in achieving greater savings than initially expected. We exited fiscal 2016, year one of integration at a net savings run rate of $120 million the top end of what we originally committed to by year three. And we're tracking well towards achieving $140 million to $150 million net as we exit fiscal 2017. The second priority was to continue to reshape our portfolio. And in April we sold the Aerostructures business we acquired with Exelis at an attractive multiple using the proceeds to pay down debt. The third priority was to maximize free cash flow when we exceeded our guidance of $750 million to tight management of capital spending and a four-day improvement in working capital, absorbing over $100 million in cash restructuring and integration costs and $174 million in cash, pension contributions. And finally, our fourth priority was the de-leverage and during the year we retired $650 million in debt, about one-third of our three year debt reduction goal allowing us to rebalance our capital deployment priorities as we reinitiate share repurchases in fiscal 2017 with a placeholder of $150 million. And we executed these priorities, we are also continuing to drive operational excellence deep into the company to lower costs and improve program execution, reinvesting some of the savings in R&D to drive future growth. Company-funded R&D was again this year a little more than 4% of revenue, a spending rate higher than our peers, and which has led to a number of important strategic wins. So let me provide a few highlights on the quarter before Rahul discusses our detailed segment financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.45, up 10%, with results benefiting from the acquisition, a lower tax rate and improved operating performance. Operating profit was up 6% and margin improved by 190 basis points on organic revenue down 6%. Improved performance was driven by the capture of synergy savings, lower costs and solid execution within Space and Intelligence, Electronic Systems and Critical Networks all contributing to higher income and higher margin. Space and Intel had another terrific quarter with revenue up 10% and operating margin up 510 basis points, following an equally impressive Q3 with continued strength in the classified area including space superiority and protection. We're successfully leveraging our broader technology portfolio and in the quarter we were awarded a $104 million contract as primed in a new classified mission area that could potentially develop into another key franchise for Harris. In the Commercial Space market we are seeing the beginning of a recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle. Following an award in Q3 for a new 18-meter space reflector, we received in the fourth quarter a contract from Airbus for a 12-meter folded rib reflector for the European Space Agency's Biomass satellite. Our opportunity pipeline in this area remains robust heading into fiscal 2017. The Electronic Systems also delivered excellent results with revenue up 4% driven by higher electronic warfare and counter IED sales and 910 basis points of margin expansion. Electronic warfare was up in both Q3 and Q4 coming off a weak first half, and we continued to win modernizations on legacy platforms with orders for the year doubling over prior year. And significantly, following the close of the quarter, ES received a two-year $189 million contract from a country in the Middle East to provide the land forces with an integrated battle management system, showcasing our competitive strength as a prime contractor providing an integrated solution. The contract is for one brigade, but there are opportunities to add three more land brigades, sustainment, radios and an operations center to incorporate in air, navy and ground force communications. This contract also positions us well for similar projects in other countries in the region. And while Critical Networks was down 6%, it was better than expected, and strong cost controls and program execution along with savings from prior quarter restructuring actions at CapRock drove 310 basis points of margin expansion in this segment. On the other end of the spectrum, Communication Systems was weaker than expected with revenue down 24% and margins 250 basis points lower than prior year. Tactical communications declined 29% with legacy Harris down 40% with book-to-bill of 0.92. In the international market, funding remains relatively solid, but our $1.77 billion follow-on contract that supports foreign military sales took longer to finalize than expected and, coupled with an overburdened administrative approval process for task orders, caused several opportunities to stretch out beyond the end of the year. In July, we booked all the revenue that slipped from 4Q. The U.S. tactical market was also soft in the quarter as we're starting to see more cautious customer buying behavior in advance of a likely CR this fall. So while I'm disappointed by the fall-off in Communication Systems, I'm really proud of how the team responded to meet the earnings and cash flow guidance presented in our Q3 call, pointing to the operating resilience of the new post-acquisition Harris. Today we are initiating guidance for fiscal 2017, reflecting continued progress and solid execution of our strategy. We expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.90, flat to up 4%, on organic revenue down 1% to 4%, with operating margin continuing to increase due to synergies, lower costs and pension tailwind and with another year of strong free cash flow. We have set fiscal 2017 guidance expectations for tactical in line with the slower environment we're currently experiencing, and we believe we are being appropriately conservative in our estimates. So, before turning the call over to Rahul to provide some detailed segment results and guidance, I'd like to comment on the joint press release with JANA Partners issued earlier today. As a result of constructive engagement with JANA, we reached an agreement to appoint two mutually agreed independent directors to our board. One will be announced in early September and both will be nominated in our proxy for the October Annual Meeting. We have an ongoing dialogue with all of our shareholders and we welcome their input. We have a long history of strong corporate governance and we are firmly committed to maximizing long-term value for all of our shareholders. We look forward to the contributions that these two new directors will bring to the board. So with that, let me turn it over to Rahul. Rahul Ghai - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis. So turning now to segment detail on slide five and comparisons to prior year pro forma results. Organic revenue comparisons exclude Aerostructures and, just like prior quarters, are as if Exelis and Harris were combined for all of fiscal 2015. Communication Systems segment revenue was $436 million and down 24% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 29% and Public Safety down 10%. Higher tactical revenue in Europe and Central Asia was more than offset by lower tactical revenue in Northern Africa due to the expected completion of a large modernization tranche and by lower revenue in the Middle East. And even though the Middle East market remains relatively soft, revenue from the region was up sequentially. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $120 million and operating margin was still strong at 27.5% even on much lower revenue. We ended the year with legacy tactical backlog of $402 million and slightly lower than the third quarter backlog of $419 million, as a result of orders that pushed out from the $1.77 billion IDIQ from fourth quarter that Bill just referenced. On slide 11, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical orders, revenue and backlog. Turning to Space and Intelligence Systems on slide six, revenue was $529 million, up 10% compared to prior year, driven by higher revenue from a number of new classified programs, including in the area of space superiority and protection. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $83 million and operating margin was strong at 15.7% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.6%. In addition to the classified orders that Bill has already addressed, Harris was awarded a three-year $38 million contract for Advanced Baseline Imager spare modules for weather monitoring aboard NOAA's GOES-R satellites. This win is an excellent example of the complementary nature of combining Exelis' sensor capability for satellites with Harris' ground processing capability. Turning to Electronic Systems on slide seven. Revenue was $381 million and up 4% on an organic basis compared to prior year with higher revenue in electronic warfare and counter IED systems. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $73 million and operating margin was solid at 19.2% compared with last year's operating margin of 10.1%. Turning to Critical Networks on slide eight, revenue was $575 million and down 6% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization programs was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services and from the wind-down of two major programs mentioned in previous earnings calls and lower revenue in CapRock's energy business. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $81 million and operating margin was 14.1%. Margin improvement was in large part driven by previous CapRock cost reduction actions that resulted in CapRock's energy business returning to profitability in the fourth quarter despite significantly lower revenue than the third quarter. So moving to slide nine and 10, today we are initiating fiscal GAAP EPS guidance in a range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. Non-GAAP EPS excludes about $30 million to $35 million of integration costs. To remind you, non-GAAP guidance still includes approximately $132 million, or about $0.70 per share of Exelis acquisition intangible amortization. Revenue is expected to be in a range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding Aerostructures. EPS guidance reflects a change in FAS accounting methodology. Today, we've used a \u2013 historically we've used a single discount rate for calculating the interest and service cost associated with pension obligations. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we will measure the FAS pension cost in a given year, using a spot rate approach. We adopted this approach as we believe it provides a more precise measurement of our pension service and interest cost since it matches each year's individual spot rate to the projected cash flows in that year. We also reduced our expected pension asset rate of return assumption by 25 basis points to 7.75% for 2017. EPS guidance also includes $150 million in share repurchases plans during the year. Other EPS guidance details are outlined on slide nine, including an expected tax rate of 31% in line with fiscal 2016 results. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $800 million in fiscal 2017. We ended fiscal 2016 with 49 day of working capital, a reduction of four days from the beginning of the year. Our fiscal 2017 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and CapEx spend of approximately $175 million. Turning now to segment guidance. In Communication Systems, revenue is expected to be down 7% to 9% with significant decline in Tactical Communications and Public Safety trending higher. Within Tactical Communications, Harris legacy DoD is expected to be flat to up and legacy international down in mid-teens. In legacy DoD, we expect fourth quarter's cautious buying behavior to continue. However, we also expect MUOS and initial army modernization to contribute revenue in low tens of millions each. In legacy international, since the third quarter earnings call, our views have not changed significantly on where we expect areas of opportunity and challenges in fiscal 2017. Overall, we expect revenue to be once again underpinned by FMS funding support for opportunities in Eastern Europe, Middle East Africa and Central Asia. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 29.5% to 30.5% reflecting the impact of lower revenue offset by synergies from Exelis acquisition. In Space and Intelligence System, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% with continuing strength in classified and uptick in commercial space. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 16% to 17%. In Electronic Systems, revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% on an organic basis. Revenue will be higher in electronic warfare driven by the growth in backlog in 2016 and in C4I given the recent significant $189 million win that Bill just referenced. Segment operating margin is expected to improve to a range of 20% to 21%. In Critical Networks, revenue is expected to be down 3% to 6% with mission networks revenue trending higher due to our solid FAA franchise and international air traffic management opportunities. This is being a more than offset by continued weakness in CapRock energy and still tough comparison IT services. For IT services we expect revenue to stabilize at approximately $225 million to $250 million a quarter. Segment operating margin is expected to be in a range of 12% to 13%. So now let me turn it back to Bill for a few closing comments. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. Overall fiscal 2016 was a solid year, excellent progress in a multiyear strategy to successfully integrate Exelis and realize the full synergies and accretion. We'll continue to drive our operational excellence program to not only lower costs but also to streamline processes, improve program execution and increase customer satisfaction. And we'll continue to reinvest in R&D to grow our core franchises and address near adjacencies where technology and innovation are differentiators. An important part of our strategy to drive shareholder value is optimizing our business portfolio by focusing on investments in which technology provides differentiation. We dispassionately, objectively and aggressively assess which businesses strategically fit and are a better value to Harris, as well as which businesses maybe a better value on their own or with a third-party. When we believe a business is not core to our strategy to drive shareholder value, we undertake proactive steps as evidenced by the recent sale of Aerostructures and the sale of our Commercial Healthcare and Broadcast Communications businesses in prior years. We will continue to assess our portfolio with the goal of enhancing shareholder value creation. And as Rahul just described fiscal 2017 guidance, while we still expect revenue headwinds to persist, we also expect additional acquisition savings and our continuing focus on lowering cost to result in higher fiscal 2017 earnings. Our guidance anticipates a continuing resolution through the end of this calendar year, and the spending constraints it typically creates until the budget is passed; especially on our shorter cycle tactical business. Longer term, we expect positive momentum in Space and Intel. and Electronic Systems to continue, and we also anticipate a recovery in the tactical market driven by army and SOCOM modernizations, as well as other international modernizations such as in Australia and in the Middle East and Northern Africa. And with that I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Unknown Speaker : Our first question today comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Pete. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : The decline in U.S. radio volume in the fourth quarter and kind of going into fiscal 2017, and just with sort of the expectation for continuing resolution, is that softness kind of across all the services and across special forces or just the Army? And can you maybe characterize if the CR goes into first quarter of next calendar year, how much incremental pressure there might be? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it was pretty broad across the services. It was not in special operations, but it was pretty broad across the other services, mainly base type business, resets, sustainment spares, other things that we saw. And it's not really in our view a need-based push out, it's really based on just some cautionary behavior on expectations of a continuing resolution which again we are expecting through the end of this calendar year. I won't speculate today as to what the impact might be if it moves beyond the end of December, but I think it would probably put some pressure on the backend of our year if the CR moves out beyond December. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. I will just ask one more and get back in queue. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Yeah. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : It sounds like you've factored the MUOS upgrade pretty substantially in your 2017 guidance. I think, you said previously the money for that is already appropriated. Is that so, and so would there be upside to your guidance from that, and maybe give us a sense of what the Army is kind of thinking on that program specifically right now? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's really across the services and it's not so much Army driven; it's other services. But it's a \u2013 we're making very good progress. Most \u2013 in fact, all of the certifications are in place. The testing is complete. We have interim NSA certification; right now, getting a formal NSA cert should happen over the next several months. It's really administrative process more than anything, and once we get the formal NSA cert, it should trigger some orders happening. We have about $10 million in backlog right now in MUOS and we do see, as a Rahul pointed out, in next year tens of millions of opportunities in MUOS. We still feel very, very good about that opportunity in fiscal 2017, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, okay, great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. I have two questions. First, talk for a minute about Critical Networks, and I mean, there's sort of two things, one is you were able to restructure CapRock so that it's profitable, can you outline how you've \u2013 I mean, what some of the accomplishments were and how you think about the sustainability of it? And then, also can you talk about win rates in the service business, Bill? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. Let me start with CapRock. The \u2013 we exit the year about what we thought about $60 million in the quarter in CapRock energy. So, it was down quite a bit year-over-year in the fourth quarter probably around 35%, for the year in 2016 down about 25%. With oil sitting down in the low $40s, now we see a bit of incremental pressure, although there's some service companies out there that are expecting some recovery into 2017 and maybe the back end of 2017. We do see another step down next year, we're sizing it about 25%. We took some pretty aggressive restructuring actions really over the last 12 months to 18 months, but you recall pretty significantly as we exited Q2 and those are starting to take hold. We lost money in CapRock energy in Q3, we returned to profitability in Q4. And that's part of the reason why you see the CN segment, Critical Networks segment being a little more profitable in Q4, part of it comes from some turnaround in the CapRock business. So I think, we've sized it for next year. We expect to make money in CapRock energy next year, but we do see another step down in that segment again about 25%. On the services side, we were down 10%, 11% in the services in the quarter; for the year down about 22% in the services side, mission sustainment, which was about what we had expected, maybe a little bit better in Q4, but about what we expected. We do see another step down next year, sort of in a high single digit range. We have a pretty good pipeline of opportunities. We ended fiscal 2016 in that business with a book-to-bill of one. So we're holding backlog going into next year. We had previously said about a third of that business was up for re-compete and was going to put some pressure into 2017. We're now guiding to that pressure into 2017. But some of the re-competes are now behind us. I think, we're faring pretty well. There's a few that is still ahead of us. What we're seeing here is that the re-competes, we're winning them. Where we do win them, they're coming as \u2013 instead of single vendor, they're more multivendor or IDIQs instead of regular contracts. So we still have to compete for task orders. So we do still see some revenue pressure in 2017 in services, but not quite as the downturn we saw in 2016, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : That's very helpful. And then, your joint press release with JANA sounds to be very constructive. Can you elaborate a little bit on the dialogue and what you're looking for in the independent directors? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first off, the \u2013 it was constructive. They've become a major shareholder. We welcome input from all of our shareholders. We have very active dialogue with everybody. We reached an agreement to add two new independent directors to the board, and we talked \u2013 and you'll read in the 8-K and the agreement that we filed a little bit about that. One will be announced in early September, both will stand for election at our Annual General Meeting in October. But beyond that, I don't think I'll comment on any other conversations with them or any other particular shareholder, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : I understand. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Bill, I think around the time of the acquisition you've put out a long-term cash flow target, I think, for fiscal 2019 of $1 billion of free cash flow, and so the forecast for 2017 is $800 million. Is that target still operative and can you talk about the ways that you get there? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. In fact, we feel very good first off about where we came out in fiscal 2016, with a lot of puts and takes, above the $750 million guidance, so we came in at $772 million. We feel good about how we delivered that, absorbing pretty substantial pension and cash integration costs, very good improvement in working capital as we had signaled we would have. We continue to tightly manage our capital spending. So next year we guided to about $800 million in free cash flow with a little bit of a step up in capital spending, although we remain very, very tight on that at $175 million. We still see a path to getting to $1 billion by fiscal 2019. That was a three year goal that we set out. And it comes from the same things we described before on this call. Certainly the integration savings roll in this year and sort of hit steady state really going into 2018. We see lower cash integration costs. We see lower cash interest expenses. We see some additional working capital performance improvements. And since we've closed about 50% of our floor space or about 2 million square feet, we do see some additional capital spending efficiencies as we get further out in time. So those are the still \u2013 they still remain, Seth, to be the key drivers of hitting $1 billion in 2019. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up on MNVR, there was some talk in the press about an OT&E evaluation with \u2013 that they found some issues with it. Do you still expect it to go forward with an award this quarter? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, we do. We do expect Milestone C occurring later this quarter. And just to go back a little bit, we had a very good user test \u2013 limited user test back in October of last year. The Army validated the need for the mid-tier radio at 16.2 back in May, so it was very good. It was \u2013 you need the mid-tier to connect the upper and lower tactical tiers, and they've shown that. They also showed, which was the key intention of the test, was that you needed a radio like MNVR to operate in SATCOM denied or degraded environments, and it performed well. Our radio meets all the CPD requirements, and we do expect a Milestone C later in this year. The questions that were raised were really around weight \u2013 really SWaP in general, and range. And we met the original \u2013 we met the requirements. We do see opportunities to improve that over time. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Carter. Operator : Carter, check your mute button. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, we will come back around to Carter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, good morning, Noah. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bill, I wondered if you'd speak to where you expect domestic and international legacy \u2013 in the legacy Harris tactical radio business, where you expect book-to-bill to trend through your upcoming fiscal year? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're not going to give guidance on the book-to-bill. What we've given guidance on today is what we think is going to happen in the revenue environment. And we see the DoD business to be flat to up a little bit slightly going into next year. We ended the year around $70 million more or less in Q4. You see it in the back of the appendix in the DoD tactical business. We see that same cautious behavior continuing into next year, but then on top of that, we see tens of millions of opportunities in two areas as Rahul mentioned, Army modernization opportunities, which would include the MNVR opportunity, as well as on MUOS and that should bring us to flat to up slightly. We do see another step-down next year in the international business. We see that our pipeline still remains pretty healthy in that business, but we do see that business down sort of mid teens going into next year. Not a lot really has changed in many ways since our Q3 release in terms of the overall sets of risks and opportunities that are still out there. We still see some good funding on the horizon. But we see that business down a little bit going into next year. And maybe, Noah, I'll just give you a little bit more color on this, as we look out into 2017, we see about a third of that business is in Europe, which as you know we've talked before and 2016 was coming off a pretty good record year, Eastern Europe and the Ukraine remained very, very solid. We still see that strong going into 2017, but it would be down slightly from what was a record year. We see about a third of the businesses in the Middle East and Africa where we do expect to see a relatively slow pace to continue, revenue to be flat to down slightly. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities in the Middle East. There's another country in the Middle East which we see a little bit of recovery offset that, but again that Middle East Africa should be probably down slightly to flat in next year. The balance of the business or about 10% to 15% each in Asia-Pac and Australia; Australia should be \u2013 that region should be flat to up a little bit because Australia is going to come in a little bit stronger next year. We see Central America, Latin America to be flat to up slightly a little bit. We do see Brazil a little bit weaker. We see Mexico a little bit stronger, but that region up a little bit. But really as we look out to the next year, the big challenge we're facing is really in Central Asia, in particular in Afghanistan, as a pretty big program runs from lots of new radios in the past to more sustainment in 2017 and beyond. And that's really the biggest piece of the headwind going into next year. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So I appreciate all that color, it's helpful. I think, you're just starting your fiscal 2017. You've just given guidance for fiscal 2017, so it's a little unfair to go down this line of questioning. But I think that investors in the market are not particularly concerned with 2017 and are looking further out because you've won all these new programs that don't kick in until after 2017. The defense budget is only just starting to bottom, and so there's a lot of potential positive prospects beyond 2017. But on the other hand, your bookings keep trending to be relatively soft. You're talking about softer DoD, cautious buying behavior, which is not particularly consistent with I guess what a lot of other defense companies are saying. And so, point being, there's just sort of a lot of uncertainty around the growth trajectory beyond 2017 recognizing that's not the most fair question given where you are. I don't know if there's any way you could speak to those inputs even directionally to give some people some comfort in that part of the model. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, sure. Look, while we're seeing some pressure in 2017, when you see us already (33:54) down 1% to 3%, 1% to 4% next year. We've got two business segments that are coming up and coming off of a pretty good back half that's Electronic Systems and Space and Intel. So those are performing very, very well, and we expect that to continue. Within Critical Networks, we see our mission networks FAA business to be \u2013 it's been strong this past year, very strong in the second half of 2016, continuing up next year, good international opportunities. So we see that continuing to grow going into next year. We think service is going to stabilize as we get beyond 2017 into 2018, so won't be as much of a drag. And then on the CS segment, we see that segment down next year, but when you look at two things; one, the pace of awards and actions happening on Army modernization and SOCOM modernization those activities are moving quickly. Our Rifleman Radio is now through both customer test and qual test. The Manpack radio is now through qualification test. They expect to go into delivery orders in the early part of our Harris fiscal 2018. SOCOM moves \u2013 is moving nicely. We do see substantial budget upticks in 2017 from 2016, as well then in 2018 from 2017, so very good strong funding support for that. On the international side, the pipeline remains very, very strong. The needs are out there. The funding is not moving at a pace as we had expected, but there is strong need that's out there. The pipeline is pretty robust. And going out beyond 2017, we see markets like Australia to be quite significant and big contributors as we get into 2018. So we still believe that 2018 will be a growth year for Harris Corporation, and I think, we're positioning ourselves well to grow in that time period. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. And just one final question, the... William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...the remaining portfolio reshaping potential that you pointed to, is everything on the table there? I mean, could we see entire reporting segments as part of that process? Is that at least in the scenario analysis or are we only looking at smaller piece of the business? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're not going to comment on any specific analysis that's going on right now inside the company, no. We're \u2013 you know again, I wouldn't add more than what I was \u2013 I said in my prepared remarks, which I thought very carefully about. We're looking at this aggressively and dispassionately making sure that we keep businesses that add value long-term to our owners, and that's all we're prepared to talk about today. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes. Thanks. So I was wondering could you quantify, you mentioned that some of the Q4 slipped that are tactical product in Q1. Could you quantify that for us, then I've a couple other questions. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, just in terms of just the math that we gave in terms of guidance, we said the tactical business \u2013 legacy tactical would be down high single digits. You can see it came down about 14%, just the math would indicate it's sort of $65 million to $70 million slipped out into fiscal 2017. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And I have a follow-up. Can you talk about the FMS task orders that you were talking about having moved to the right a little bit? Size them for us and could you gauge whether those are incremental year-to-year? It doesn't sound like you've given the guidance of down mid-teens. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Sure, look, I mean, about the... Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: What should we expect? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, I'm sorry. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: No, I'm just curious, I mean, I'm trying to square it because it looks like there's some things you're going to catch up, but the guidance is down quite a bit. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, look \u2013 the \u2013 so again, about $65 million, $70 million moved out. A little more than half of that was international, little less than half of that was on the DoD side. So on the international side, it was several different opportunities about two-thirds of which really came out of the Middle East Africa region. And really got hung up by sort of a late, late approval on the $1.77 billion IDIQ, and then it just took some time to get the task orders through the system. And as we pointed out, we did recognize revenue for those opportunities here in July. And I wouldn't characterize it as anything more than \u2013 whether it's incremental or not, we gave our guidance for 2017, we do see the international business to be sort of down mid teens going into next year. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. So just squaring that, mid teens implies $140 million decline. You mentioned the legacy DoD flat to up, so maybe you net down $120 million, $130 million, something like that. Could you help us understand what happens to core legacy RF tactical margins in that scenario? I understand that the integration synergy benefits the overall Comm. Systems, but are tactical RF margins going to be down, and if so how much? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We've weathered this past year on a tactical business down about 14%. We weathered that downturn and had pretty good margins in 2016 and we expect to have good margins going into 2017 as well. Integration savings are a key component of that, Gautam. In fact, the significant relocation of the Fort Wayne production facility into Rochester was a tactical radio opportunity and those \u2013 and that's those savings are going to hit us in 2017 and that does backstop our margins in fiscal 2017 offsetting what would happen to be some pressure from top line coming down. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then last one, Bill, could you give us an update on the size of your international and DoD legacy RF pipeline and also relatedly, you may have answered it, I may have missed it, the book-to-bill expectation for tactical RF this year and perhaps any phasing, because it sounds like second half you will have some of those 18 opportunities start to convert to orders. I'm thinking JTRS Manpack Australia and the like but I haven't heard much about the first half and I'm just wondering if you could calibrate an overall tactical RF book-to-bill first half versus second half? Thank you. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Gautam. Look, I'm not going to give much color around book-to-bill for the year. For the company overall we do see a slightly better back half and front half, simply just by the nature of the expectations of the CR, it's going to be slightly backend loaded, but not much unusual from what we've seen in the prior year's, maybe a tick-up in the back half from what we seen before. So I won't really size or shape the tactical business for fiscal 2017. On the pipeline, the DoD pipeline still remains pretty healthy. It's in the $900 million to $1 billion size. And we do start to see more of the modernization opportunities starting to come into the pipeline. On the international side, the pipeline remains about $2.6 billion. We said last time about $2.9 billion. The big opportunity we had in there that drove it to $2.9 billion was Australia, $600 million. We feel good about the opportunity. It's still out there. As we gotten into detailed negotiations with Australia, they may split that into two pieces, they may do $300 million, $350 million at the back end of our fiscal 2017, the balance may slip out a little bit beyond that. And that was the key driver of bringing down our international pipeline to about $2.6 billion. But it's still sitting at a very robust level, which gives us some confidence of growth in fiscal 2018 as a company overall. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. I'm sorry, so that was my last one. I did want to ask Rahul, if you could just talk about where the unfunded pension and OPEB now ends fiscal 2016, and what if any implications that has on cash contributions longer term. Thank you. Rahul Ghai - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So our total pension deficit, Gautam, increased by about $100 million to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion, and this includes both the pension and the OPEB liabilities. So we previously said that our pension liabilities increased about roughly $180-ish million for every 25 basis points reduction in discount rate, and the discount rate changed by 40 basis points. But that was partially offset by the contributions we had made and certain changes in the postretirement benefits. So our total deficit ended at $2.3 billion, up $100 million from where we ended last year. It really has no impact on our contributions because that's a kind of a different formula. Our total contributions will go up a little bit next year because the discount rate at which we calculate with the contributions is coming down, and also, the rate of return on assets need to be factored in. So contributions are up about $10 million, $15 million year-over-year, but that also gets offset by the cash reimbursements that we get from the government. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, guys. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Can you hear me this time, guys? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We can hear you, Carter, yes. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Perfect. Malfunctioning mute button there. So just a couple of quick ones, as a lot of these have been asked. On the pension, Rahul, can you size for us where those incremental tailwinds went in the segments, just to kind of get a sense of what impact that had on the margins? And then, Bill, at least from a high level, I understand that it's classified, but this new win and new franchise that could be bigger longer term, can you help us from a high level just to understand the size and scale and maybe the growth prospects of what that is? Thanks. Rahul Ghai - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. So let me start, Carter, and Bill can take the second one. So the FAS pension benefit is, as you know, is largely on the Exelis portfolio. So by the nature of that, that went to Space & Intel, ES and Critical Networks because that's where the majority of the FAS benefit is just given where the Exelis business happens to be in our business. And you can see the margins in those segments did get a benefit from those FAS contributions or FAS changes. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And on the classified one \u2013 go ahead, Carter. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I'm just thinking if we assume 40%, 40%, 20%, kind of split between those segments to kind of get a sense of what the underlying margin movement is, is that a fair split? Rahul Ghai - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : With the changes, yeah, if you assume 40%, 40%, 20%, I don't think you'll be that far off in terms of those three segments. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Okay, sorry. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And on the classified piece, you're right, I mean, we really can't provide a lot more color on that other than what we've talked about. But I'm very pleased and very proud of what the team has done over the course of fiscal 2016, certainly in the back half in our proprietary business, classified business. A lot of this relates to using different capabilities acquired with Exelis, combining with what Harris legacy has, moving from sensors to systems to now providing end-to-end solutions. And that allows us to have a different conversation with customers on where we can plug in as a prime mission provider. And these things evolve over time. The team has done a fantastic job of articulating our newfound capabilities, and the customers recognizing that and providing opportunities back to Harris Corporation. So I really can't say much more than that other than we're performing very, very well in a classified space with good back funding support and with a lot of good, strong prospects into the future. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And one last clarification. I know you highlighted Iraq as an opportunity last quarter and it sounds like in your response to Gautam's question, Iraq is still an opportunity. So I guess, are we to assume that none of that has entered the backlog just yet? William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I won't talk about what we've certainly booked in the month of July in terms by country, but it is an opportunity in fiscal 2017, what slipped from June moved into 2017. There was you recall back when we announced our Q3 earnings, we recalibrated guidance for tactical and part of it was an opportunity for Iraq that moved into 2017, that is still sitting out here. That is going to happen. There's funding support for that. Iraq remains one of our biggest opportunities, certainly for next year, but also more importantly in terms of a longer term pipeline. There's lots of opportunities in Iraq. It comes both in the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interiors, different funding support \u2013 funding backstop (46:48) support, but it's really a good opportunity for us going into 2017 in our tactical business. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Bill. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet, Carter. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, we'll take one more question. Operator : Thank you. Our last question for today is a follow-up from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. Thanks guys. I guess, Rahul, I was wondering if you can give us a full depreciation amortization forecast for fiscal 2017 and then I mean you guys did a good job of beating your free cash flow guidance in 2016 despite kind of all the headwinds. So I'm just wondering, if you could talk about maybe how much upside opportunity that could be in 2017 if we avoid some of the incremental headwinds that we saw in 2016? Rahul Ghai - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So we've mentioned our amortization is roughly the same year-over-year on the Exelis deal, beyond that we would not like to comment. In terms of our cash flow, listen, we feel good about the $800 million if you look at the kind of the $770 million that we did this year with the tailwind that Bill mentioned on coming off the integration cost adjusted for tax. We do have some pension income that is non-cash, and then a little bit of CapEx changes and then working capital improvement, that gets us to about $800 million, we feel good about that. And I really don't want to go beyond that at this point. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I don't think depreciation and amortization in total is changing in 2017 versus 2016, it's about flat, so there's not an incremental contribution in cash going into 2017, Pete, on D&A. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Rubun Dey - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Harris Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Hi. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I'm Pamela Padgett and on the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO, and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and CFO. First a few words on forward-looking. Forward looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information on a related discussion, please see the press release, presentation, Harris' SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. All right. Bill, with that, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Harris began fiscal 2017 with a good start out of the gate and we're executing well against our key strategic priorities. So I'll begin with a quick update about how we're delivering on them. As part of an ongoing initiative to optimize our business portfolio, we announced earlier this morning a definitive agreement to sell the CapRock commercial business for $425 million and plan to use the proceeds to pay down debt and repurchase shares. Portfolio shaping supports our strategy to invest in businesses where Harris can provide technology differentiation. And we'll continue to review our portfolio and objectively assess which businesses are a strategic fit and which businesses have better value under different ownership structure. We also remain committed to smart and balanced capital deployment, and in the first quarter, we used $100 million in cash to repurchase shares, and we increased the dividend 6%, our 15th consecutive annual increase. We also repaid $33 million in term debt and, in early October, retired a $250 million bond that was due, making further progress towards our three-year debt reduction goal of $2 billion and we're about halfway there. We remain laser-focused on Exelis integration and capturing synergies and related accretion and, through Q1, we're tracking well towards capturing $50 million of additional in-year savings and achieving our target of $140 million to $150 million in run rate savings as we exit fiscal 2017. And while all integration projects are complete or well underway, we'll continue to find ways to lower cost and drive productivity, as part of our normal operational excellence agenda. And then, finally, investing in R&D and new product development to grow core franchises and expanding the close adjacencies has been an important part of our strategy. And in the first quarter, R&D spending was up 7% and over 4% of revenue. For the year, we still expect to spend at about 4% of revenue, similar to fiscal 2016 and at a level well above our peers. So turning now to Q1 results, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.39, up 6% on a 2% organic revenue decline. Despite the revenue headwind and higher R&D spending in the quarter, operating margin increased to 50 basis points as a result of higher synergies, productivity savings and pension income. Earnings per share also benefited from a lower tax rate in the first quarter. Revenue reflected continued growth in Space and Intel up 4% and Electronic Systems up 2%, while Communication Systems was down 5% and Critical Networks was down 7%. Orders were particularly strong with total company book-to-bill of 1.17 and funded backlog of 6% over the prior quarter. Book-to-bill for each segment was above 1 and within Communication Systems, we saw strong recovery in our legacy tactical business where book-to-bill was 1.22. Healthy bookings, plus several opportunities that slipped from the back half of fiscal 2016, drove backlog up 16% sequentially to $467 million and higher in both DoD and international. Q1 revenue in legacy tactical was also encouraging down 1%, with DoD revenue up 4% and international down 4%. Within DoD, higher first quarter revenue was primarily related to achieving important milestones early in the year for MNVR and MUOS. We received a limited rate production authorization on MNVR, which is our mid-tiered networking radio and formal NSA certification for running the MUOS satellite waveform on existing Falcon III 117Gs, which triggered initial fielding of MUOS capability. Also in the quarter, the Army contracted Harris to develop the narrowband mode for the Soldier Radio Waveform or SRW, a requirement for all Army modernization radios. The Manpack, the Rifleman, the MNVR and the future SANR or Small Airborne Networking Radio. This contract demonstrates Harris' leadership and expertise, in adapting complex waveforms to meet the changing requirements of the Army's tactical network. In legacy international, revenue trended favorably against our full year guidance and was higher in Europe, Central and Latin America or CALA, and Asia Pacific, but was offset as anticipated by lower revenue in Central Asia and the Middle East Africa regions. You'll recall that Europe was strong in fiscal 2016, driven primarily by Eastern European countries, and that trend continued in Q1 with encouraging signs for the balance of the year. The CALA region is benefiting from a country's modernization of NextGen radios and a new $90 million contract win from U.S. Southern Command, supporting counter-narcotics missions in Latin America. And in Asia Pac, we're supplying HF and multiband radios to support maritime capability in the Southeast Asian country as part of an ongoing trend of the U.S. bolstering partner capabilities in the region and a significant opportunity remains on the horizon in Australia. So overall, regional trends of strengths and headwinds are tracking about as we laid out in our 3Q and 4Q earnings calls and while still early in the year represents a good start towards achieving our full year guidance. Turning to Space and Intel, we had another quarter of excellent wins from customers in the intelligence community, which continues to be a solid growth area for the company. In the quarter, Harris won a $25 million initial contract to develop a multi-mission small satellite for a classified customer, our second government win in this area. Smallsats are emerging as a low-cost solution to a rapidly changing threat environment, offering a shorter development cycle and launched at a fraction of the cost and lead time of a large exquisite satellite. Our offering in this growing niche is powerful, combining a portfolio of advanced sensors, software defined radio technology to support on orbit mission changes, and Harris' agility to quickly innovate as threats evolve. We also continue to build on our franchise in space superiority. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was selected for $53 million in follow-on work to provide counter-communication capabilities that detect adversary interference and take action to protect our space assets. This new win will bring contracts to-date for this mission to about $200 million. And then outside the intelligence community, we received a $90 million follow-on contract to provide navigation payloads for GPS III Space Vehicles 9 and 10. We're already under contract to deliver payloads for SV 1-8, and we're investing to develop a fully digital solution for 11-32. Turning to Electronic Systems, Q1 marked the third consecutive quarter of strong bookings for electronic warfare, winning modernizations on legacy platforms where we have strong incumbency positions. And as the EW capability gap between the U.S. and peer countries has narrowed, modernizations on deployed fleets have become a higher priority. Wins included a $22 million contract for the B-1B, and a three-year $55 million contract to redesign the electronic warfare system for the B-52. B-52 wins, over the last two years, now stand at about $200 million, and we continue to see strong future opportunities on fleets with long modernization tales. In Critical Networks, Harris extended its reach into a new market by leveraging a strong and long successful history with the FAA, for designing and maintaining highly secure communication networks. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a 14-year, $700 million ceiling IDIQ from the State of Florida, to provide a state-wide secure communications network. This network, called My Florida Net-2, will have about 4,000 sites connecting public safety, law enforcement and other state and local government agencies. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Rahul, for more financial detail and guidance. Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just to remind you, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and supplement GAAP results in our other quarterly earnings material. Turning now to segment detail on slide 4. Communication Systems segment revenue was $431 million and down 5% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 6%, primarily as a result of lower international SINCGARS sales. Public Safety was down 1%. Operating income was $119 million compared with $138 million in the prior year, driven by lower volume and mix. On slide 10, we have again included historical information for legacy tactical, orders, revenue and backlog. Space and Intelligence Systems on slide 5. Revenue was $453 million and up 4% compared to prior year. This was driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers and from Radiation Budget Instrument program called RBI to provide sensors for monitoring climate change and global warming on NASA's Joint Polar Satellite System. Operating income was $80 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by continued strong program performance and higher pension income. Electronic Systems on slide 6. Revenue was $361 million and up 2% on an organic basis compared to prior year, excluding $19 million of revenue from Aerostructures business that was divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Higher revenue from initial ramp of recently awarded integrated battle management systems in Middle East and from electronic warfare solutions was partially offset by lower wireless product sales. Operating income was $74 million compared with $69 million in the prior year. In addition to the electronic warfare contracts that Bill mentioned, Harris received $35 million in follow-on contracts for the F-35 program. Critical Networks on slide 7. Revenue was $527 million and down 7% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FAA's NextGen modernization program was more than offset by lower revenue in IT services, down $13 million and in CapRock's commercial business down $25 million. IT services revenue, it was in line with expectations of it stabilizing in the $225 million to $250 million per quarter range and CapRock commercial is now at approximately $75 million per quarter. Operating income was $66 million compared with $63 million in the prior year. On top of what was already mentioned, Harris was awarded a five-year $125 million single award IDIQ for IT services from a classified customer. This extends a 25-year relationship and reflects a business development focus in the intelligence community. Moving to slide 8 and 9. Fiscal 2017 guidance remains unchanged with GAAP EPS guidance in the range of $5.53 to $5.73 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.70 to $5.90. As previously communicated, the EPS guidance reflects $150 million in share repurchases for the year. Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, down 1% to 4% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from Aerostructures divestiture. Outlook by segment and other details outlined in the slide also remain unchanged, including generating an expected $800 million in free cash flow for the full year. Although the first quarter tax rate was 27.5%, we still expect a full year tax rate of 31%. Our expected 31% rate reflected adoption of the new accounting standard of stock compensation and the benefit occurred primarily in the first quarter. The remaining three quarters are expected to average 32%, varying quarter-to-quarter depending on specific tax timing differences. We will update fiscal 2017 guidance once CapRock transaction closes. Now, I will hand it back to Bill for a few closing comments. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay, well thank you, Rahul. Overall, we had a good start to the year, delivering solid financial results and making excellent progress on our key strategic priorities. We're maintaining guidance for the year and we anticipate that the continuing resolution will extend to the balance of the calendar year and constrain spending as it typically does until a budget is passed. We'll continue to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our business portfolio, deleveraging, reinvesting to drive future growth and allocating capital in a shareholder friendly way. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Hi, Seth. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm not sure how much you can comment on it, but there have been reports in the press about potentially divesting other portions of the Critical Networks business. I wondered can you talk a little bit more about your vision for that business, specifically, in the future. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, Seth, thank you for the question. I'm not going to comment on any potential plans. We simply don't \u2013 we don't do that. I think we feel good about the transaction we're announcing today on selling the CapRock commercial business. And we've got a pretty strong track record here of looking pretty objectively at the businesses that we're in and assessing which fit and which do not. And I take you back to the broadcast business and commercial healthcare and Aerostructures, now, the commercial CapRock business, and we continue to look pretty objectively at the portfolio that we have and assess what fits in and what does not. I would say that I've been pretty consistent in commenting that we want to be in businesses where technology can differentiate our offering in the marketplace, that's very important to us. Of course, we look at strategic fit and performance of the business, but that is certainly the bar, the milestone that we're tracking there, and we'll say more as the time goes on, but nothing more to report today. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, okay. Great. Thanks. And then, just as a quick follow-up, more in the model and Communication Systems, it's the nice quarter for the tactical radios. The margin overall for the segment was a little below your guidance for the year, is that reflecting R&D or mix or what's going to change through the course of the year to bring that margin up? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, it reflects both. I mean it's down year-over-year; its flat sequentially. Part of it is volumes of the tactical comms business, not just radio, but tactical comms, it's a bit less favorable mix. We had slightly more sustainment services business in Q1, a little more front-end loaded R&D, which should mitigate a little bit over the course of the year, of course, these things move quarter-to-quarter, but over the balance of the year, we'll expect better mix, and we do expect us to achieve the guidance margins for the year of about 30%. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : I was just hoping to go back to CapRock. I was just wondering if you expect that to be accretive or dilutive, and then, what could be the cash proceeds from that sale. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, we're selling for $425 million, so cash will be a little bit below that, probably over $400 million. We're going to use it for both debt pay down and share repurchases, probably a little bit more than half on debt, a little less than half on share buyback. On an annual basis, we would expect it to be about $0.04 dilutive. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. And then, it seems like you had a couple of good quarters in terms of bookings for electronic warfare. I was hoping you could maybe size that business and what we can expect for the outlook going forward. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, we feel really good about the performance in electronic warfare, had really strong bookings, really throughout last year. Orders doubled, backlog grew quite a bit, book-to-bill was stronger than one, and coming out of the first quarter, good revenue growth, but also good strong bookings, we feel very good about that business. This is \u2013 again, we've got very strong positions in a number of legacy platforms that require modernization upgrades. There is new threats on the horizon. Our military has talked quite a bit about that, and our aircraft need to be upgraded. And we certainly have a great position on F-18, on international F-16s, and large aircraft like B-1B, C-130 and the B-52 has been an important driver of our bookings and future growth. So we feel very good about where we're at today on electronic warfare. We continue to invest in smaller sizeable in-power (19:51) platforms. We've got a good position on the classified side. And over time, when you compare Harris' front-end phased array technology with electronic warfare capabilities from Exelis in the back-end, that capability is pretty special. So we feel good about where we stand today in electronic warfare. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Is that about half of Electronic Systems, is that a fair estimate? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: A little less than that. Yeah, the \u2013 yeah, it's about 5, 5.50 (20:18) in that range. Greg Konrad - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Bill, first quarter sales come in a little stronger than you expected just because of the CR kind of ongoing, or do you think it will impact more from the second quarter because that's the first fiscal quarter of the government's year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I'm sorry, Pete. (20:44) the phone is breaking up a little, I didn't hear the (20:47) something coming in stronger. Could you say that one more time? Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah, sorry, I was just wondering if your first quarter sales came in a little stronger than you expected because of the CR or do you think that the CR will impact more so your second quarter because of the \u2013 that's the first fiscal quarter of the government's year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we see, sort of going back a number of years, we've been operating under a CR at the beginning of the government fiscal year. So we tend to see some end of your money getting spent bookings and revenue and that had to slow down a little bit in the second quarter. So we would expect a normal friction we would typically see in our Q2, as we typically have seen in a CR \u2013 under a CR (21:28) improving in the back half of the year. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Pete. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Bill, you highlighted the very strong book-to-bill in the quarter, but I was wondering if \u2013 of the orders you've taken in the last three months, what is the lead time on this? Is it any different from what you normally expect, I mean what we're obviously looking for is when did this convert into revenues? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, the bookings we saw which were pretty good on the tactical side are relatively quick turn orders. I mean that's a short cycle business, so the majority of that will turn in the year and that's positive for us, but it depends on the business. There are some parts of the company that are longer cycle. The very long \u2013 the big order we got in the State of Florida is going to happen over the next decade effectively. Some of the EW orders are going to be over the next three years, four years. So it depends on the business. Our longer cycle businesses tend to be in the ES segment and Space and Intel segment, and of course, the shorter cycle orders are going to come in our tactic or CS side. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then, the second question, you've mentioned in the past that the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa have been softer markets for you on the radio side recently. Has there been any sign of that stabilizing as yet? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we're not seeing anything better today than we did over the last three months to six months. It's the same factors that we've been talking about that continue to impact that region, certainly, low oil prices which seem to be going down even further or causing budgetary pressures. We know the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, it's driving some instability. Some of the funding is going more towards munitions than communications. But I would say that we've seen some opportunities firm up in a couple of areas like Jordan and the UAE. In Jordan, we booked an order here in the first quarter. We see more opportunities on the horizon. Saudi continues at a relatively low level. 2016 came down from 2015, but we don't see another big step-down in 2017. It right now is running at a relatively low level as we see it. There's some pressure in Iraq just because of the strike in the (23:46) country, but the opportunity we see on the horizon in Iraq are very, very sizeable. It's probably the biggest opportunity overall in our long-term pipeline. So it's a mixed bag within the Middle East, but not much of the story has changed over the last three months to six months. Some of the slips that happened from 2016 into 2017, we have started to book, and we'll continue to do that in Q2 and Q3. So thank you, Rob. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: I had a couple of questions. First, last quarter, if I recall, Bill, you mentioned there were $65 million to $70 million of shipments that slipped into the first fiscal quarter. And I was wondering, did you, in fact, catch those all up, and were those booked in the September quarter or were those in the backlog as of June 30? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, I think we said that was around $60 million worth of orders did not happen in Q4. A little more than half was international and that did slip into the year into Q1. So it was like $30 million, $35 million in that range and, yeah, we pick those up in Q1 effectively as part of our release. The other part was the DoD side and that was just general slowness and some friction cautious buying behavior on the part of some of the acquisition folks. So that was not necessarily a slip. Certainly, the international piece that moved into Q1 did happen. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And that was a book and ship in the September quarter? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Largely, yes. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Could you talk a little bit about the tax basis of your IT service business and could you size it for us? I believe it's about $1.03 billion, but wanted to get your sense for that? Also, what the tax leakage will be with the CapRock sale, how much will you actually net in terms of proceeds? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, I'm not going to comment on the tax basis for services, but services is around $1 billion business, and there's no tax leakage on the CapRock transaction. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And also, previously, you've updated us on some of the major campaigns like the JTRS Manpack Radio timing. I wondered whether to see, A, when is that going to happen. And do you think it will still be two awardees? Relatedly, if you could talk about when Australia might actually book some orders, is that still in fiscal Q4 this year and maybe any of the other sizeable campaigns that we should be tracking? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, yeah, let me start with Australia. I mean it's still a big opportunity on horizon, and it's on the order of in total about $600 million or little less than that, but they decided to split it into two pieces, as I mentioned on the last call, and we still expect about half a book towards the back-end of our fiscal year, the other sometime into 2018 or beyond. So we feel very good about the progress there and our position on that particular opportunity. On the Manpack, it continues to progress. We are one of three awardees. It's a very sizeable contract. We complete the qualification test. The customer testing should happen early in fiscal 2017, so with the next three months or four months, and then, it will go into \u2013 a delivery order procurement will be made by \u2013 decision will be made by August, I believe, of next year, with deliveries off of that starting about a year from now and then, continuing into early calendar 2018, so that has not moved out in terms of the delivery timeframe on the back end. On the other one, which is important is Rifleman. We're one of two vendors, us and Telus (27:37) and you recall it's a $3.9 billion IDIQ, we've gotten through a qual test and customer test. It was for a single channel radio, but you recall that left a big part of the overall war value with the opportunity for a two-channel radio, and it does sound like the Army is looking to perhaps accelerate the purchase of a two-channel radio. They saw the opportunity, the radio we have with SOCOM, which is a single vendor award that we have as Harris Corporation. They sold the radio. There is a possibility they will accelerate the purchase of a two-channel radio which I think will be relatively good news for Harris since we're well-positioned on that particular opportunity. And you saw in Q1 or at least I mentioned in Q1 that we had a milestone C approval on mid-tier radio with half of the opportunity recognized in Q1, the other half will come sometime later in our fiscal 2017. So overall, I think good progress. MUOS, we're very pleased with receiving NSA cert and to see initial fielding of that capability. Keep in mind there's 30,000 117Gs in the field that have the possibility of being upgraded with the MUOS waveform. And as that happens, since the development is all behind us and it's a software load, it comes down to us at a relatively high margin, so all of which I think is good progress in the quarter got them. The last one I would mention is on SOCOM, I think the very important one, and that's a two-channel radio that continues to progress. We're investing in it and we still see that on track for deliveries about a year from now. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, everyone. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Noah. Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Bill, so you've mentioned or you've gone through a lot of detail on a number of moving pieces into your potential future order flow. I wondered if you would just \u2013 if you're able to tell us if you think the total company book-to-bill and also, specifically, the legacy tactical radio book-to-bill will be above 1 for the full year fiscal 2017. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: That's certainly the trajectory that we're on and the hope that we have. Right now, we came out of the gates in Q1 very, very strong and I think we're pleased about that. And we always hope for \u2013 as we expect growth in 2018 and beyond, we certainly hope for good positive bookings in this year that would lead us into growth in 2018. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. As a follow-up to the question on the Middle East contribution to the legacy tactical radio business, is it possible to quantify what the peak to trough has already been in that revenue stream, just so we can get a sense of how much lower that could go or maybe if it's approaching a floor just because enough of a decline has already happened? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I think see, we're probably down about 40% peak to trough at this point. And from the way we see it today, the Middle East should \u2013 may be down slightly more again in 2017, but it depends on the timing of some opportunities in Iraq, again Jordan looks pretty good, UAE looks pretty good, a couple of other things are progressing pretty well in the quarter what we see in the balance of the year. And the funding support from the U.S. government still remains pretty robust. So we don't see a big step-down in the Middle East, but that's where we see it today. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And so, what is that run rating then as a percentage of your legacy tactical radio business after that 40% peak to trough? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's about \u2013 on the order of about 25%, 30% of the international business, international about two-thirds of the total tactical, legacy tactical. So it will be a little bit less than that of course. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. And what is SINCGARS down to at this point? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's at a relatively low rate. It's mostly international business. There's still some sustainment work going on with the U.S. military, but a lot of that business is international and is experiencing some of the same challenges in our legacy tactical business, a lot being sold into the Middle East. And as you know, we talked about a pretty good opportunity that's been sitting out on the horizon in Saudi Arabia. It's in the $40 million to $50 million range for SINCGARS, and that still remains towards the back end of the year, but that would be the next big opportunity on the horizon, but it's at a relatively low rate. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And I'll sneak in one more. The $700 million Florida Comm Systems contract, how much of that will go into the backlog in the December quarter? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: It's relatively small. I think it's in tens of millions at this point. So it's going to be low for this quarter. It will come lower as we roll this thing out. It will come in phases. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: This is a very big important opportunity for us, because today, we've won the state law enforcement radio system in Florida, and we've been doing that for 15 years, now through 10 hurricanes without a single outage. So we feel very good about that, and that credibility alongside of our reputation with the FAA allowed us to beat a very large telco out of a pretty substantial contract interconnecting a bunch of offices to the State of Florida. So we feel very good about the position that we happen to be in here, and it's going to roll itself out over the next decade or so. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Terrific. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Noah. Operator : Thank you. And we have time for a follow-up question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Co. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thanks again. I just have a couple small questions here. One, what is the share CRIP at this point, option CRIP? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I think it's about 1 million shares. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's about 1 million shares. So with the buyback in Q1, we held our share count I think, Rahul, about flat. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah, so Gautam, our overall share count kind of on the diluted share count is about flat. We ended Q4 at 125.3 million, and we ended Q1 at 125.5 million. So that's where we are. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. So you need approximately 100 million just to offset CRIP, just to be clear. Is that right? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And is there plans to \u2013 you mentioned with the proceeds of CapRock you'll repay debt. I mean what is sort of the longer-term plan? Is the plan to take advantage of the weakness in the stock or I mean I just wondered like how flexible is your logic around buyback versus debt repay? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So as Bill mentioned, our current plan is that we'll use slightly more than half the proceeds to pay down debt and slightly less than half for share buyback. What we have to \u2013 what we are balancing here, Gautam, is just we have of high debt to EBITDA ratios and we have commitments to our debt rating agency. So we're balancing that, and we have an aggressive debt buyback \u2013 debt paydown goal. So that is the objective at this point. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Okay, operator... William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Go ahead, go ahead, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. The other thing I just wanted to make sure, maybe I missed it, but is there any way you can size the opportunity to upgrade the installed 117G base with the MUOS software capability? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, I mean we see that could be just north of $100 million. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: $100 million in aggregate... William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: ...across all 30,000, is that right? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It will be more than that. Yes, that's the total opportunity that we see, as we sit here today. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then, Bill, just given all this, if you could put it together for us, what do you expect the book-to-bill to be at tactical legacy RF this year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, we expect it to be over 1. And I think that was a comment I was trying to make earlier today, which is as we go forward into and think about fiscal 2018, we still see some important elements that will drive growth. We see good performance in our longer cycle businesses in Space and Intel and Electronic Systems. We came off of a back half of 2016 with good growth. We had good orders. We ended with higher backlog. We came out of Q1 with good growth, higher backlog, good orders, and that will carry us into fiscal 2018. As we go through this year and we look out into 2018, we still see strong Army monetization opportunities, SOCOM monetization opportunities, Australia will start to come into the picture, and we still see good opportunities to grow that business in fiscal 2018. So that would require us to have a pretty solid bookings through the year. We're early in the year. We had a great start. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Well above 1 or \u2013 I'm not trying to be annoyed. I'm just asking because what you sized in the later part of this fiscal year could be fairly substantial contract awards. I mean $300 million award from Australia would move the needle presumably. I'm just wondering is a 1.2 out of the question, or I mean over 1, it seems like a little bar at this point. So I'm just \u2013 could you help us...? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's also early in the year. I mean you don't win a football game in the first quarter. You got three more to go. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: And I'll continue to give you an update on the way we see the market, the environment, the opportunities we're chasing, as we go through the year. I think as we've done pretty clearly, over the last couple of years, we'll communicate as much as we can, but right now, we expect and our folks up in the tactical business expect that we'll have a good year and a book-to-bill over 1. And I think, at this point, that's all we're able to communicate. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Gautam. You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: Operator, we will take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open. Rubun Dey - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys. This is actually Rubun on for Carter. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Rubun. Rubun Dey - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey. Bill, do you think you can speak to more specifically, I guess, like how much op profit and EBITDA you expect to be leading with the CapRock business here. I just wanted to try to get my head around some of the metrics of the deal. Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. We expect revenue in that CapRock commercial business this year at about $300 million. We did about $75 million and we're sort of at a level run rate for the year, so about $300 million. And it's a mid single-digit ROS business, so call it, 5% to 6%. And it's got $35 million, $37 million of D&A. So that can help you with some of the metrics. Rubun Dey - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Pamela A. Padgett - Harris Corp.: All right, everyone, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Pamela Padgett, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Pamela Padgett : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I\u2019m Pamela Padgett. On the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and CEO, and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. So, first, some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information on the related discussion, please see the press release, presentation and Harris\u2019 SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation on non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com where a replay of this call also will be available. And with that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. William Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Pam, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results as we continue to execute well on our strategy to shape our portfolio, deploy capital in a balanced and shareholder-friendly way, drive operational excellence including strong execution on Exelis integration and position the company for long-term growth through sustained investment in high-return R&D. Last week, we achieved a major milestone with the announced sale of IT services, following closely on the heels of completing the sale of CapRock in early January. The divestitures of these two businesses with combined revenue of $1.4 billion, together with the acquisition of Exelis in mid-2015 and the sale of Aerostructures, commercial healthcare and broadcast, completely reshapes the company and sharpens our focus on core franchises where technology provides differentiation. The new Harris has a more simplified business model with a streamlined portfolio of higher growth, higher-margin businesses. These actions, when combined with the significant R&D investments we\u2019ve made over the last five years to support our key franchises, position our company for growth at a time when government budgets are bottoming and beginning to trend up. The divestitures also provide more than $1 billion in net proceeds that we\u2019ll use to support our capital allocation goals \u2013 about 40% for share repurchases, 60% towards deleveraging and pre-funding the pension. $435 million of sale proceeds will be used to buy back shares, which when added to the $150 million we committed to at the beginning of the year, plus an incremental $115 million provided by free cash flow, raises total fiscal 2017 share buyback to now $700 million, the largest single year share repurchase action in our company's history. And since the buyback will fully exhaust the remaining share authorization of $584 million, the Board added a new $1 billion authorization, demonstrating confidence in future free cash flow and our balanced and shareholder-friendly approach to capital allocation. $225 million of sale proceeds has been used to reduce debt, supporting the deleveraging goals we set when we acquired Exelis. With this payment already made, we have now repaid $1.3 billion against a commitment of $2 billion of debt reduction by fiscal 2018. And $400 million of sale proceeds will be used for pension pre-funding, which fully funds the pension on an IRS basis and eliminates, at least for the next few years, the mandatory annual contributions currently running at almost $200 million. With the divestitures of CapRock and services, we will now operate the company with three segments and eliminate the Critical Networks organizational structure. The air traffic management business will now operate as part of Electronic Systems segment, with no changes to Communication Systems or Space and Intel. The restructuring actions we\u2019re taking will significantly reduce stranded costs; and by closing the transaction and implementing essentially all of these actions before the end of fiscal 2017, we expect to limit the fiscal 2018 dilutive impact of the divestitures to about $0.10 to $0.15. Now, before Rahul walks you through the divestiture details intended to simplify what are clearly a lot of moving parts, we\u2019ll first touch on 2Q results. Now, keep in mind that 2Q compares have CapRock removed from current and prior year. It\u2019s not until the third quarter that IT service is reported in discontinued operations. Second quarter non-GAAP EPS was a $1.42 with operating income up slightly and operating margin expanding 50 basis points to 17.6% and higher in each segment. For total company EPS, the improved operating performance was offset by a higher tax rate. Revenue was $1.7 billion, down 2% on an organic basis. We posted solid revenue growth of 6% in Electronic Systems, 5% in Space and Intel, and 2% in Critical Networks. Communication Systems revenue was down 16%, with higher DoD tactical radio sales more than offset by significantly lower international. Total company book-to-bill was 0.83 in the second quarter and just over 1 in the first half. Legacy tactical orders were strong in the second quarter, with a book to bill of 1.1 and backlog rising again this quarter, now up 22% fiscal year-to-date. Higher backlog was driven by international, partly offset by relatively weak US orders. Europe remains particularly strong, coming off of a record fiscal 2016 and trending towards another record year, driven by countries in Eastern Europe modernizing in the face of regional instability. And in 2Q, orders included a $75 million order from a country in Eastern Europe with several significant opportunities expected to book in the second half. In the Middle East, a region that\u2019s still relatively constrained, we were encouraged by several significant orders, including from two countries that slipped from the back half of last year. $16 million from an unnamed country and $19 million from Iraq. Following the close of the quarter, we booked a $56 million order from a country in Northern Africa as part of a multi-year, multi-phase modernization program. A key strategy for our company, even while faced with constrained government budgets, has been to invest our own R&D dollars to innovate and develop new products to expand our core franchises and drive future growth. And in 2Q, we see evidence of this winning strategy from tactical modernizations progressing to an expanded footprint in space superiority to early successes in rebuilding the electronic warfare franchise. In tactical, we continued to invest in new product development to support both US and international modernizations that are expected to drive renewed tactical growth in fiscal 2018. Army and SOCOM modernizations continue to progress and we shipped about $5 million in HMS Manpack customer test units last month and expect a first delivery order decision in the August timeframe, with shipments beginning in the fall. For SOCOM, development and testing of the two-channel handheld continues to progress and we will submit our proposal this week for the two channel Manpack with an award still on track for the summer, with deliveries beginning at the end of calendar 2018. With the Army and SOCOM, as well as countries like Australia interested in the new two-channel Manpack and handheld products, our ability to scale investments and leverage technology platforms is driving R&D efficiency and resulting in core technology being shared across multiple products for US and coalition partners. Another recent investment has been on our newly-developed wideband HF radio, which delivers data up to ten times faster and is 20% smaller and lighter than prior generations. Harris has long been number one in HF radio technology and the changing threat environment and greater concern over SATCOM deniability has increased customer interest in HF radios as an alternative for beyond line-of-sight transmission of classified images, maps and other large data files. Already released for the international market, the radio just received NSA Type-1 certification and is on track for US government release in mid calendar 2017. Given the favorable response from customers, we currently expect an incremental annual revenue stream in the low tens of millions, boosting our base business across the services. In Space and Intel, our classified businesses continued to be key revenue growth areas again in the second quarter. That positive trend was also reflected in new wins, including follow-on contracts of $53 million and $29 million for space asset protection and situation awareness capabilities. And following the quarter-close, we received an $80 million classified contract in what we can describe as a ground-based adjacency that has the potential to become a new franchise area for the company. Our recent awards reflect continued success in leveraging technology investment to broaden our reach and move from providing components to subsystems and to now full mission solutions. Over the years, we've leveraged expertise and technology from government markets to grow in commercial space where recapitalization and fleet expansion cycle is currently underway. In the back half of 2016, we were awarded two unfurlable antennas and we commented that prospects were stronger than they've ever been in more than almost a decade. And in this quarter, we were awarded another two reflectors and were pursuing another ten opportunities, with expected awards over the next few years, so prospects remain positive. In Electronic Systems, electronic warfare continued to be a growth driver. Over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve had excellent success in rebuilding the electronic warfare franchise, winning modernizations on legacy platforms with long tails and building a strong backlog. While EW growth has been primarily US-based, we had two new international wins in the quarter, $91 million for EW pods for Moroccan F-16s and $22 million on the IDECM program to upgrade electronic countermeasure capability on Australian F-18s. Longer-term, we\u2019re investing in next-generation technology to pursue new platforms by marrying Harris\u2019 front-end state-of-the-art phased array antenna technology with Exelis\u2019 back-end processing. In both Electronic Systems and Space and Intel, bidding and proposal activity remains very high and our opportunity pipeline continues to grow, giving more confidence in growth in 2018 and beyond. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Rahul to walk-through 2Q financial results, divestiture details and guidance. Rahul Ghai : Thank you, Bill; and good morning, everyone. One additional reminder. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude Exelis integration cost. And as Bill just mentioned, second quarter results exclude CapRock, but include IT services. Turning now to segment detail on slide five. Communication Systems segment revenue was $413 million, down 16% compared to prior year. Tactical Communications was down 19%, with higher DoD tactical radio sales more than offset a significantly lower international revenue in both legacy Harris and SINCGARS product line. Public safety revenue was down 5%. Backlog in the legacy tactical business is up $26 million in the quarter, driven by orders from international customers. Operating income was $121 million compared with $138 million in the prior year due to lower volume. Operating margins trended higher from integration savings as a result of the closure of the Fort Wayne factory. Following the close of the quarter, Harris was awarded a five-year, $403 million, single-award ID/IQ contract from US Defense Logistics Agency to provide tactical radio spares to the US Army and federal civilian agencies. Space and Intelligence systems of slide six. Revenue was $458 million and up 5% compared to prior year, primarily driven by higher revenue from intelligence community customers. Operating income was $77 million compared with $68 million in the prior year from continued strong program performance and higher pension income. Electronic Systems on slide seven. Revenue was $384 million and up 6% on an organic basis compared to prior year. Higher revenue from electronic warfare solutions and the continued ramp of an integrated battle management system in the Middle East was partially offset by lower wireless product sales. Operating income $79 million compared with $68 million in the prior year, driven by benefits of higher volume, continued strong program performance, and high pension income. Critical Networks on slight eight. Critical Networks segment revenue was $454 million and up 2% compared to prior year. Higher revenue from FA's next-gen modernization program and NASA Space Communications Network program was partially offset by lower IT services. Segment operating income was $75 million compared with $66 million in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from a contract settlement, partially offset by less favorable mix of program revenue. Moving to slides detailing the two divestitures and the expected impact in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. Slide nine outlines the two transactions, including previously expected fiscal 2017 results for CapRock and IT services. IT services is anticipated to close before the end of fiscal 2017. But regardless of the timing of the close, it will be reported as discontinued operations beginning in the third quarter. Total proceeds from the sale of businesses are expected to be $1.060 billion and we plan to use $225 million off the proceeds to pay down debt, $400 million to prefund pension, and $435 million to buy back shares. The bottom right box on the slide details the sources of the expected share repurchases of $700 million in fiscal 2017. So far this year, we have repurchased $100 million in open market and expect to repurchase $350 million through an ASR program that will be initiated in the third quarter and the remainder either through an ASR program or open market purchases in the fourth quarter. We will see full accretive benefit from this repurchase activity in fiscal 2018. Moving to slide ten and the waterfall chart detailing fiscal 2017\u2019s expected dilution of $0.50 as a result of moving CapRock and IT services to discontinued operations for full year and only partially benefiting from the proceeds of the sale. The new non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.540 to $1.560 reflects the dilution from the divestitures and partial offsets of a one-time tax benefit of $0.12 and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 31% to 30% from various tax planning activities that is worth an additional $0.08. And until we have clarity on the timing of the one-time tax settlement, we are assuming that the settlement will take place in the fourth quarter. While Q4 is typically our strongest quarter for revenue and EPS, we expect this year\u2019s Q4 to have even greater weighting due to the timing of specific international tactical opportunities, the one-time tax settlement and the benefit from additional share repurchases, all following the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2018 dilution, shown in the next column, is expected to be in a range of $0.10 to $0.15, reflecting a full year benefit from the use of cash proceeds, restructuring actions to minimize stranded costs, and partial recovery of stranded costs on cost-plus programs. Turning to slide 11, which is our typical guidance slide. Fiscal 2017 updated guidance for revenue and EPS is changing only to reflect both CapRock and government IT services reported as discontinued operations for the year and the change in taxes. Total company revenue is expected in a range of $5.76 to $5.88 billion, about flat to down 2% on an organic basis, excluding revenue from the Aerostructures divestiture. Full-year GAAP EPS is expected in a range of $5.21 to $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS in a range of $5.40 to $5.60 excluding Exelis acquisition-related integration charges. Guidance contemplates IT services transaction closing before the end of the fiscal year.  Also, we\u2019ve updated our tax guidance for the year to 28.5% to reflect the changes discussed on the previous slide. Expectations for free cash flow of approximately $800 million are unchanged with the exception of prefunding the pension, which is reported in operating cash flow. Prefunding of pension is in addition to our annual contribution of approximately $188 million for a total pension contribution of $588 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the pre-funding, cash flow guidance is consistent with our previous expectation of approximately $800 million of free cash flow for the year. Moving to slide 12, outlook by segment is unchanged with the exception of giving effect to the organizational change of operating in three instead of four segments. Electronic Systems is now a combination of previous expectations for both electronic systems and the air traffic management business. Critical Networks segment has been eliminated. For simplicity, stranded costs and FAS pension income related to the divestitures are shown separately. On slide 13, we have provided preliminary estimates of historical information for the ongoing business in the three new segments. This will be updated later with the final stranded cost and should reflect reallocations of stranded cost and FAS pension to the three segments. William Brown : William Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. These two divestitures simplify our business model, leaving us with a more focused portfolio of technology-based, higher-margin and high-growth businesses. As a result, fiscal 2017 guidance on a newco basis now reflects margin expansion over the prior year of 70 basis points to 19.4% and high-single digit EPS growth. Looking to fiscal 2018, the clean slate of core franchises provides a much stronger platform for returning to total company growth and the more than $1 billion in net proceeds supports increased fiscal 2017 share repurchases, offsetting much of the fiscal 2018's dilutive effect of the divestitures. And we\u2019ll continue to drive our operational excellence agenda to find other ways to lower costs and increase earnings power, providing even greater operational leverage as we return to growth in fiscal 2018. And with that, I\u2019d like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. You may begin. Robert Stallard : Thanks very much. Good morning. William Brown : Good morning, Rob. First of all, on the bookings in the quarter, so start with that, it came down a little bit from what you saw in the first quarter. Is this a natural sort of seasonal pattern? What might you expect for the rest of this fiscal year? William Brown : Well, we saw bookings to be \u2013 the book to bill was a little below 1. It was about 0.83 in the quarter, but we\u2019re about 1 \u2013 just over 1 in the first half. As we talked about last time, we still target to hit about 1 for the full year. So, we feel good about where the orders happen to be over the first half of the year. Robert Stallard : Do you expect the sort of level of volatility from quarter to quarter to be there in the second half of the year? William Brown : Well, quarter two was a little bit lighter. We came out of the gates pretty strong in Q1. We\u2019re operating under CR in Q2. We will see good orders growth in the back half. And I think for the full year, coming in around 1.1, 1.0 level book-to-bill. Robert Stallard : Okay, thanks. And then, just a quick follow-up on the pension, I was wondering if you could clarify the prepayment \u2013 I think you said that this now means you don't have to have any obligatory payments beyond fiscal 2018. Is that correct? And what\u2019s the impact? Rahul Ghai : With the $400 million of pension contribution, this pension is now fully funded from an IRS perspective in fiscal 2017. And so, at this point, we don't see any contributions for 2018, 2019, 2020 assuming the rate of return, the discount rates and the mortality tables do not change. So, that's the expectation \u2013 there is an expectation that the mortality tables would change over the next couple of years, and that may drive a small contribution in 2020. It won\u2019t be material. And beyond that, it's difficult to understand how it would shape up, given the change in discount rates with the expiration of the Highway Act and the mortality tables rate of return. So, we feel good about 2018 and 2019; and 2020 and beyond that, it's difficult to project. Robert Stallard : And if this stuff moves around \u2013 it does sound like probably you saved $188 million of free cash flow in 2018, 2019, and 2020, is that correct? Rahul Ghai : Yes. That\u2019s correct. Robert Stallard : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Gautam Khanna : Hey. Could you update us on the timing of some of the bigger international awards you\u2019re anticipating, such as the Australian order, Algeria, etc.? William Brown : Well, on Australia, we are in negotiations there. We still anticipate a sizable order. We size it around $300 million or $350 million in that range. We still expected in our fiscal 2017, it's going to happen probably at the back end of fiscal 2017, but we\u2019re in negotiations. There\u2019s really not much more to report on that. It's moving along and we still feel very good about that. And regarding Algeria, otherwise known as that country in Northern Africa, we did see some good progress earlier this quarter. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And what about some of the other bigger international campaigns, Saudi, Iraq, what have you? Are you having any life after a big decline we\u2019ve seen in the Middle East over the last couple of weak quarters? William Brown : For Middle East and Africa, we see continued slow pace of awards through the back end of this year. It\u2019s at a relatively low-level now in the Middle East. Saudi is sort of in $10 million, $15 million range, so it\u2019s not very big. Iraq, we saw some progress this quarter. We saw an important booking come through that was delayed from fiscal 2016. Now, we de-risked the back end of the year \u2013 even though international tactical is coming up, we\u2019ve de-risked the year. We still see strong support for Iraq. Some of the ITF [ph] funding is a little bit slow to flow through there, so we de-risked that. But Iraq looks very, very positive to us on an ongoing basis. It still remains probably the biggest opportunity that sits in our inner medium-term pipeline, so we feel good there. UK moved out a little bit. The Morpheus program, that\u2019s probably in 2021 time period. But there's some opportunities in the near term on providing some product in waveform enhancements for enhanced ACDR radios in the UK. So, UK is still sitting out there as well. And we continue to see good momentum being built in a number of important countries in Central and Latin America. So, overall, I think that all looks pretty good. I think the big story really is around Europe. And where Europe happens to be, it is substantially stronger today than when we stood three months ago. It is pretty much clearly going to be a record year. A lot of it\u2019s Eastern Europe. And we see a number of sizable opportunities that are moving through the pipeline. They have been \u2013 the LOIs have been signed, funding has been allocated; and for them, it\u2019s mostly administrative in nature. And they will book here in the next few months. So, we feel very good about what's happening on the international side here, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : Bill, one last one. With the JTRS Manpack award being LPTA, I\u2019m just wondering, what do you expect will happen to pricing on that contract over time? Do you expect it to be fairly aggressively bid on a task order to task order basis, such that the return profile won't match what you do at the segment now? I'm just curious, do you think it will be accretive to the segment average or dilutive? And if so, when and by how much? William Brown : Well, I think it\u2019s going to be competitive as it has been. I think the good news is that it has been open to competition and I think the good news is that we want a position on a very, very large ID/IQ contract, $12.7 billion. We feel very good about our product. We've been through qualification testing. We\u2019re now starting into customer testing. We\u2019ve shipped radios. We've got, I think, great position here. And the fact that we've got tremendous scale in Rochester and an incredibly large international business, it does bring us some advantages in that particular offering. It will be competitive and we\u2019ll compete every year for delivery task orders. But I think we feel very strongly about the offering we happen to have in the marketplace. And, of course, as you know, Gautam, we continue to invest in bringing capabilities and feature upgrades to that radio over time, and I think that\u2019s going to pay some strong benefits. So, we feel good. We feel good about where we stand on the Manpack. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Gavin Parsons : Hi. This is Gavin Parsons on for Noah. Good morning, everyone. William Brown : Hey, good morning. Gavin Parsons : When you look at the Middle East orders that you talked about, some encouraging signs there. Does that look more like it's just the catch-up of the slippage or does it look like you maybe have some visibility into an inflection and better spending in general in the region? William Brown : No, most of what we saw in the second quarter was a catch-up of the slippage. I would say the Middle East is sort of continuing apace, maybe even a little bit slower than we thought before. We still see \u2013 as I said, we moved out some of the opportunities we were seeing in the back half of the year in Iraq into next year. They\u2019re there. They\u2019re going to happen. They need funding. But we\u2019ve shifted that out. We\u2019ve de-risked a couple of other opportunities. Saudi remains at a very low level. We moved the SINCGARS opportunity, which we had sized before in this call, around $40 million, $50 million, we moved that out of the year, so we\u2019ve de-risked that as well. So, I think the Middle East, I would characterize as not getting any better, maybe incrementally a little bit worse. But the fact is that we\u2019re seeing very, very strong opportunities elsewhere and it\u2019s causing us to get more optimistic and increase our guidance for the year on where the international tactical business is going to land in. Gavin Parsons : Thanks. And then on US bookings, is there any impact from the continuing resolution? William Brown : Yeah. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 first of all, we started the year, I think, maybe relatively conservative. We said it would be flat to up at the beginning of the year. Now, it's probably about flat. So, it's not collapsing. So, it's come down a little bit. And I think we\u2019re well calibrated there. We did a pretty careful review of opportunities in the back half. We have a good sense of what has been booked and how much backlog flows into the back half and we pulled out of the back half any opportunities that hinge on \u2013 that aren\u2019t mission-critical or hinge on a fiscal 2017 budget. So, the things we have in the back year are mission-critical, can be funded out of a CR or are funded by 2016 budget. I think we\u2019re relatively calibrated. DoD being about flat in the full year. So, we think that's pretty good. So, that came down a little bit, offset by the international business being stronger. Gavin Parsons : Okay. And lastly, is your free cash flow target for fiscal 2019 still $1 billion post the divestitures? William Brown : It is, yeah. We still see a path to get to $1 billion. Keep in mind that we've lost, I\u2019d say, about $100 million more or less in free cash from the divested businesses. But as Rahul pointed out, we will not have to make cash contributions the next couple of years into our pension, mandatory cash contributions. They tend to offset one another. And the same drivers of getting to about $1 billion in several years remain there. Working capital improvements. We see some of the cash integration expenses and restructuring expenses coming down. We see interest expense coming down. And we see earnings continuing to grow. It hinges on some new programs, hinges on a good budget. But that would be the closing item that gets us to about $1 billion as we get into 2019, maybe into early fiscal 2020. Gavin Parsons : Great, thank you. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. You may begin. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. William Brown : Good morning. Seth Seifman : Bill, after the portfolio moves that you made here -- I don\u2019t mean to imply that that\u2019s more to do \u2013 because you\u2019ve, obviously, done a ton over the past several months. But is the portfolio kind of where you want it right now or are there other pieces that you might be thinking about moving out of? And then, when you think about sort of how Harris fits in going forward, we\u2019re, obviously, a little bit smaller now and you think about the opportunities for a company in the $5 billion to $6 billion sales range, is this kind of the scale level that you think is sufficient to accomplish the type of things that you want to accomplish? William Brown : Look, I feel very good about some of the portfolio shaping that we\u2019ve done, not just recently, really over the last four or five years. And I referenced some of that in my prepared works. We\u2019re much leaner, more focused, more streamlined, more strategically focused, I should say, higher margin business. And I think we\u2019re really well-positioned in a number of important areas at our defense electronics, mission-critical communications, high-capacity networks that are well-positioned given where the budgets happen to be going. But as you know, portfolio management is not a start and stop sort of a game. We always take a look at the portfolio businesses that we happen to be in and making sure that we\u2019re optimizing businesses that we\u2019re in and where we\u2019re investing to drive shareholder value. The fact is that, at about $6 billion in revenue, I wouldn't consider us to be subscale. I would consider us to be focused. And now, we can take our management team and focus them on those businesses that really can truly drive shareholder value going forward. Seth Seifman : Great, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the piece of Critical Networks that you\u2019re keeping, the FAA work, and I believe \u2013 although maybe you can confirm \u2013 there\u2019s some NASA work there as well and that'll include the Florida work that you want as well and sort of how that business fits in? I think we always knew it was relatively high margin, but I think it\u2019s \u2013 actually the statements you put out this morning show it is quite profitable actually. And how you see that profitability profile going forward and the growth outlook going forward? Because it seems like this is something where maybe there are no one or two big chunky opportunities from time to time rather than a consistent pipeline. William Brown : Yeah. That business that we\u2019ve called mission networks is primarily FAA air traffic management businesses and related business, so also international opportunities that fall into there. It\u2019s mostly there. It\u2019s very little NASA. We\u2019ll, obviously, report that Pacific missile range facility in that segment, but that's very small. But it\u2019s primarily air traffic management related. It's about roughly $700 million last year. It's growing sort of mid-single digits. It\u2019s rolling into the Electronics System segment at about that segment margin level. It's helped this year, at least a little bit by a contract settlement we had in the quarter. Call that business a mid to high teens margin business, with, I think, good growth outlook both within the FAA as well as importantly international opportunities, like we\u2019ve seen in the UK, like we've recently won some opportunities in Turkey and Taiwan, we\u2019ll see some opportunities in India and Brazil over time. So, that business has, I think, a good positive growth outlook and, again, the margins on sort of a normalized basis rolling in between mid-teens and high-teens. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. William Brown : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. You may begin. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, guys. William Brown : Hey, good morning. Carter Copeland : Just a couple of clarifications on the pension. Rahul, I just want to make sure, the $188 million, you mentioned, was, I thought, a gross contribution on the pension, so the addition to cash flow of no contribution needs to be a net, I would assume, unless I was wrong. And then, I wondered if you could tell us how much of the gross liability moved with the divestitures as well. Rahul Ghai : Sure, Carter. You\u2019re right that the net contribution \u2013 and that\u2019s what Bill was talking about earlier when he was projecting kind of giving color on the cash flow for 2019. He was talking about the divested \u2013 cash flow from divested businesses at about $100 million and the net pension benefit kind of offsetting that. So, you\u2019re right. $188 million is the gross. And then, you take the tax rate off that. So, they kind of offset each other. So, that's the pension piece. None of the pension liabilities really moved with that divested businesses. We are retaining both the liability and the associated income. Right now, our deficit \u2013 we started the year at about $2.3 billion. And with the movement in interest rates and the additional contribution that we\u2019re going to make \u2013 assuming interest rates kind of stay constant \u2013 it will be about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion at the end of fiscal\u2026 Carter Copeland : So, the liability that you're keeping \u2013 or that portion of the plan has FAS income. Does it have a CAS expense? Does it have a billable expense associated with that? Rahul Ghai : So, we will keep both, Carter. We will keep the CAS recovery and the FAS income. Carter Copeland : And how much is the CAS? Can you disclose that? Rahul Ghai : It\u2019s in low tens of millions. It\u2019s not a significant piece of what we recover because a lot of that \u2013 it was on the legacy Harris side, so it\u2019s not big. Most of it is coming through \u2013 most of the recovery is coming through Space and ES segments. Carter Copeland : Okay. And then, just a clarification on the international softness. I don\u2019t know if you can kind of give us some color around, regionally, what that would like, though. It would seem that if it were isolated to the Middle East, it would sort of imply that the Middle East was down quite sharply. So, I just wondered if you could give us some color about that and I know you mentioned that Saudi was at a very low level. Is it a nearly no level waiting to recover or any color you could provide is helpful. William Brown : We started the year with the legacy international tactical business down mid-teens. And now, it's sort of down high-single digits. So, it has improved over last 90 days. And as I said, Europe has gotten quite a bit better. I said before it was about one-third of the international business. Now, it\u2019s probably 40% to 45%. We see that being up strongly. It will be another record. And you saw a pretty important order come through in Q2 in Eastern Europe, about $75 million. We noted it my remarks and in the press release. So, that\u2019s pretty good. The Central America, Latin America business is still about 10% to 15% of the business. That\u2019s up. It\u2019s firming. It\u2019s firming to the upside. We took an order from US SOUTHCOM for counternarcotics, and that\u2019s starting to bring some orders through. So, the CALA region looks pretty good. And in the three other regions, the Middle East/Africa is going to be a little bit softer. The Asia-Pac/Australia business is going to be a little bit softer. That\u2019s probably more like flat to down a little bit as opposed to flat to up. And then, Central Asia is about the same, maybe a little bit weaker. It\u2019s about 5% to 10% of the total business. We\u2019re seeing some significant headwind Central Asia as I reported last time because of the transition that\u2019s going on in Afghanistan from radio buildout to sustainment. That's not a change. That\u2019s still what\u2019s happening today. But that businesses is going to be down pretty much in Central Asia. So, Carter, those are the basic pieces. Overall, international, we\u2019re now down high-single-digits versus down mid-teens. Carter Copeland : Great. Thank you for the color, Bill. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. You may begin. Peter Skibitski : Hey, good morning, guys. I\u2019ll just start by saying great use of cash proceeds. Bill, on the CR going to April or May, your domestic radio sales are up through the first half of the year. What do you attribute that to because I think there\u2019s a lot of expectation that the CR going so long was going to be a lot of headwind for you, but it hasn\u2019t turned out to be that way, what do you attribute that to? William Brown : Well, I think we\u2019re bumping around at a relatively low-level, Pete, on the DoD tactical side. The size of the business in the $300 million to $350 million, I think, in many ways, it\u2019s like base sustainment. So, it's not a lot of modernization, sort of tens of millions of dollars in modernization business that\u2019s flowing through. That\u2019s pretty much fully booked and being realized. So, it\u2019s really just a base business. I really attribute it to that. We started the year \u2013 and I think the first half was pretty decent on the DoD side. A little bit softer in the year. With the CR shifting from December to April, if it moves out beyond April, could be a little bit incrementally worse than that. But we\u2019re optimistic about a budget by then and a good Q4. So, that's how we see it shaping up. Again, DOD about flat for the year. Peter Skibitski : Okay. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on some of the emerging initiatives out there in DoD. I imagine it is a positive for you if the Army forestructures increase. And there's 350 shipped Navy. I wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s big impact to you, but I was interested in your thoughts. William Brown : Look, every indication I've seen, including recent correspondence from the new Defense Secretary Mattis, is encouraging for us. It's making sure the force is prepared, is ready, is sized appropriately, it has mission-critical capabilities, which I\u2019d also include in that the ability to communicate amongst themselves and with coalition partners. Some of the things that we've seen recently in the last year-and-a-half in Eastern Europe, which is very strong for us, really comes from this ability to communicate with our US war fighters. So, I feel good about where we happen to be. Every indication is that there remains strong support going into our fiscal 2018 for modernization. SOCOM is moving along well both on the handheld radio as well as on Manpack. And every indication has been that the Army Manpack program is going to stay on track through the summer, into next year. We\u2019ve all shipped \u2013 all three parties have shipped CT radios, customer-tested radios. They\u2019re on track for testing that in the next few months, with a delivery order coming towards the end of the summer and shipments starting in the fall. So, all of that feels, I think, Pete, pretty good for the outlook for that DoD tactical radio business. Peter Skibitski : Great, thank you. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi. You may begin. Jason Gursky : Good morning, everyone. William Brown : Good morning, Jason. Jason Gursky : I\u2019m wondering if we could start with Space and Intelligence Systems and talk a little bit more about the classified, the adjacency. Two fronts here. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you got here. And then secondly, perhaps define for us what you view to be a franchise program. William Brown : Yeah. Well, first of all, how we got here is by, I would say, number one, really strong execution on the programs that we've had with this community for really decades. It goes back a long time. So, the team does a very good job and we\u2019ve been investing in IRAD in this segment. We've talked before about the amount of IRAD we\u2019re spending at Harris Corporation. Just on a normalized basis, if you pull out services and CapRock, we\u2019ll be about 5% of revenue this year in IRAD and it's been remaining at a relatively high level even with sequestration and some of the budget pressure. So, we\u2019re investing in IRAD in lots of places, including in the Space and Intel segment. And the third part is the additional capabilities that we have acquired with Exelis that allows us to offer more end-to-end solutions than we\u2019ve been able to provide in the past. So, all of those things together, with really good execution by the team, I think allows us to step up and provide a different mission solution to our customers. And, obviously, it\u2019s classified, so we\u2019re not really able to talk a whole lot about it, but that's really what puts us in a great position. The budgets are strong here and we happen to be in areas in satisfying needs that are important, like space resiliency and protecting our space assets. So, those kinds of things are very, very important. So, what is a franchise? A franchise to us is something that has the potential to be sort of hundreds of millions of dollars, not tens, and sustainable over a period of time and lead to broader opportunities. And this new ground adjacency \u2013 it\u2019s adjacent because it does evolve from a capability that we have been providing on a component basis and allows us to take on a much bigger role at this particular \u2013 in this particular community. So, really \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s really all that I can say here, Jason, but I think we feel great about the developments and trajectory that Space and Intel happen to be on over the last year, into this year, and going into next year as well. Jason Gursky : No, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that. And then, just secondarily, on the 2017 guidance, you talked a little about the potential impacts of the CR. So, my question is going to be away from that, I suppose. I was just wondering if you could comment, outside of CR, what the risks and opportunities here are to your fiscal 2017 guidance? If we end up higher, what do you think drove that? And if we end up being lower, where do you think we may go up? William Brown : I think we\u2019ve done a pretty decent job of calibrating the year, Jason. We, obviously, look very hard at \u2013 given where the new administration is and what we\u2019re hearing coming out of the Defense Department, there is a lot of uncertainty in funding. So, we have tried to de-risk our business to the best extent that we can and look at including in guidance opportunities that are funded by fiscal 2016 dollars, so already appropriated and where there\u2019s support for that. Or mission-critical requirements that can be funded under a CR. And that\u2019s where we happen to stand today. We have, as Rahul mentioned, the international tactical business. And tactical, in general, will be stronger in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. And we\u2019ve got to make sure that we execute those opportunities, so they do happen in our fourth-quarter, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on. Jason Gursky : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. William Brown : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. You may begin. William Brown : Good morning, Howard. Operator : Howard, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Our next question is from Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. You may begin. Josh Sullivan : Good morning. William Brown : Good morning, Josh. Josh Sullivan : I just had one, digging into the public safety, how do you see public safety operating as the FirstNet contract comes into play here. William Brown : Well, FirstNet has been \u2013 it was anticipated to be awarded towards the end of last year, on November/December time frame. That has been delayed. There\u2019s no hard date now as to when that will be awarded, but that is intended to be a very large investment in a national, dedicated public safety broadband network, so LTE across the country, driving interoperability across all state agencies and with federal agencies, high-capacity bandwidth to provide video and other things and tied directly into the existing LMR system. So, that is the intention of FirstNet. Again, there's no awardee yet. We don't have any insight as to what the timing of the award is going to be at this point. But I would say, regardless of who ends up building out this network \u2013 which by the way is going to take probably five years, it's a very large investment to build out this dedicated network. Regardless of who wins, we will be in a position to provide products, devices, applications to whoever happens to be the winner of that particular program. So, we are \u2013we have developed and launched an important radio that the \u2013 XL-200P which has LMR and LTE capable \u2013 it\u2019s a capable radio. There\u2019s mobile radio we've done, there\u2019s a mobile router, all of which positions our devices and applications such that when LTE does happen, when this public safety broadband network does happen, we\u2019ll be in a great position to provide products and devices to whoever wins that. Josh Sullivan : Okay, thank you. William Brown : Sure. Pamela Padgett : Operator, I think we have one more on the line. Operator : Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Gavin Parsons : Thanks, guys. Thanks for the timing on Manpack. Thanks for the update. When should we expect that to start contribute to bookings? Is that not until calendar 2018? William Brown : Yeah, that will be probably calendar 2018. We expect the first delivery order \u2013 at least what the Army is telling us \u2013 sometime in the fall of this year. So, the production award around August/September; delivery starting, maybe after October. So, maybe a little bit towards the back end of 2017, but more likely it starts to ramp into early 2018. Gavin Parsons : And then, for your expectation for revenue growth in fiscal 2018, should we also think of higher margins? William Brown : I think what I would comment on here is that we do expect higher revenue in fiscal 2018 fiscally from fiscal 2017 because, this year, modernization revenue is in the tens of millions. So, it\u2019s going to be more than that into fiscal 2018. And frankly, all of our programs in this area, we expect to come in at attractive margins. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d comment any more than that. Gavin Parsons : Thank you. William Brown : Sure. Pamela Padgett : Okay. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you\u2026",

Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thanks, Chanel. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I'm Anurag Maheshwari. On the call today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris' SEC filings. In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and welcome to your very first earnings call, and good morning, everyone. Anurag has recently taken over as Head of Investor Relations from Pam, who retired from Harris after 20 terrific years. Anurag has been with Harris for about three years, leading business development in the Asia-Pacific region and previously worked in private equity in Singapore for about seven years. He and I also worked together at United Technologies in Singapore about a decade ago, and we're very pleased to have him here at the corporate office. So earlier today, we reported third quarter results that extend our strong year-to-date performance as we continue to deliver on our strategy. Our key priorities for the year have been to focus the portfolio on our core technology-differentiated businesses, deploy capital in a balanced and shareholder-friendly way, drive operational excellence, including flawless integration of Exelis, and continued invest- to position the company for long-term growth. Last week, we achieved an important milestone with the completion of the sale of IT Services that we announced in late January. This transaction marks the fifth asset sale in the last four years, as we've shaped the company around our core franchises where technology differentiates our solutions. The sale of CapRock and IT Services, along with year-to-date free cash flow, has generated $1.5 billion that we are using to buy back stock, deleverage, pay dividends, and pre-fund pension. We remain on track to execute $700 million of share repurchases in fiscal 2017, a record for Harris in a single year. Between share repurchases and dividends, we will return about $950 million in cash to shareholders this fiscal year. We still plan to use $400 million in proceeds from IT Services to pre-fund the pension, freeing up future cash flow, and we continue to deleverage as planned, paying down $575 million in term loans and other debt through April, and bringing debt repayment since the Exelis acquisition to $1.3 billion of our $2 billion goal. Exelis' integration continues to progress well through the third quarter, with all projects near completion, as we generate an incremental $50 million of synergies in fiscal 2017. We expect to exit the year at $145 million of run rate synergies, higher than our initial estimate of $100 million to $120 million, and a full year ahead of our original plan. Moving forward, we'll continue to drive productivity, lower cost, and improve program execution as we extend operational excellence, best practices throughout Harris. Our progress on these strategic objectives is reflected in solid third quarter and year-to-date results. Despite organic revenue down about 3% in the quarter, operating margin was a strong 19%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was up 2%, to $1.38. Year-to-date organic revenue was down about 1%, operating margin up 50 basis points, and non-GAAP EPS up 5%. Free cash flow was $164 million in the quarter and $410 million year-to-date, as we enter what is typically our strongest cash quarter. Total company book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter, and greater than 1 year-to-date. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance, we're tightening our guidance for fiscal 2017 and now expect revenue down about 1%, the midpoint of prior guidance, and earnings per share of $5.50 to $5.55, slightly above the previous midpoint. Free cash flow remains unchanged at about $800 million. And before turning the call over to Rahul to go through the details by segment, let me provide some high-level color. Legacy tactical revenue continues to trend better, up 1% in the quarter, with international up 8%, driven by strong growth in Europe and Latin America. Europe remains a solid growth area following a record fiscal 2016, driven by a broad-based modernization effort across Eastern Europe, in particular in Poland and Romania in the quarter, and Ukraine earlier this year. In Latin America, we continue to build on the momentum from the first half with an even stronger third quarter, resulting in significant double-digit year-to-date growth from modernizations and counter narcotics programs. International tactical continues to trend to the upside, with revenue down about 10% year-to-date, versus down 19% in the first half. And we now expect international tactical revenue to be down mid single-digits for the year, versus the prior high single-digits guidance. We expect a strong fourth quarter on an easy compare to prior year, with solid backlog coverage and line of sight to the remainder. DoD tactical revenue, as expected, was down about 20%, driven by an extension of the CR through April and cautious buying behavior. With revenue up 1% year-to-date, we continue to see DoD about flat for the year, which implies Q4 being about flat as well, with a large part in backlog or funded with fiscal 2016 budget. Overall, we're now seeing legacy tactical to be down low to mid single-digits, an improvement from down mid to high single-digits in the prior guidance. Army and SOCOM modernization programs are progressing and are well supported. In the pending omnibus package, the HMS program is fully funded at $274 million in GFY (7:24) 2017, up significantly from the prior year and matching the House Defense Appropriations Bill that was passed in March, indicating strong continued support for Army modernization. On SOCOM, we submitted the Manpack proposal in February, with the decision expected this summer, and we remain on track to complete the development of the two-channel handheld and begin product deliveries in the second half of our fiscal 2018. Electronic Systems was flat for the quarter and up 3% year-to-date, driven by the ramp of the UAE Battlefield Management System program and strong double-digit growth in electronic warfare. Our outlook in electronic warfare remains positive, with a solid and growing pipeline of upgrade opportunities on international F-16s, where the installed base is over 500 aircraft plus upgrades and new builds on U.S. and international F-18s. We also see strong growth in the avionics business, with two consecutive quarters of strong orders for long-term platforms like the F-35, F-18 and P-8. In Space and Intel, we were down 3% in the quarter, but still up 2% year-to-date with growth largely driven by classified customers where we continue to expand into new adjacencies. Although, we had good growth in the first half, it's being offset by a few program transitions moving from development into sustainment in the second half and more recently by a few task orders and commercial opportunities slipping into fiscal 2018. As a result, we now expect revenue for Space and Intel to be about flat in the year. With the pipeline that had grown by 8% to more than $11 billion over the past year and our continued the high win rate, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for the business. We're now in the final innings of fiscal 2017 and we're encouraged by our year-to-date results and confident in our expectations for the balance of the year. Congress will be voting on an omnibus package later this week and I'm hopeful for a positive outcome. As we look to fiscal 2018, all of the components for top-line growth are coming together, forming an inflection point for Harris. Fiscal 2017 share repurchases will offset much of fiscal 2018's dilutive effects from divestitures and our operational excellence agenda will continue to lower costs and contribute to earnings growth in 2018 and beyond. So, let me now turn the call over to Rahul to walk through our financial results. Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude Exelis integration and other costs. This quarter, we transitioned to a three-segment reporting structure and results and guidance exclude both CapRock and IT Services, which are reported as discontinued operations. Turning now to segment details on slide 5. Communication Systems revenue in the quarter was $461 million, down 5% versus prior year. Tactical Communications revenue was also down 5%, but legacy tactical was up 1%, driven by international which grew at 8%. Year-to-date backlog for legacy tactical is up 5% to $421 million. Operating income for the segment was $140 million, compared to $151 million in the prior year due to lower volume. Year-to-date segment revenue is down 9% with operating income down 10%. Year-to-date operating margin of 29% is down 60 basis points versus prior year due to lower volume partially offset by synergy savings. However, operating margins have trended sequentially higher for three consecutive quarters. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1 for the quarter, with strong bookings in Public Safety and Airborne radios. This quarter, we received a $36 million order for Small Tactical Terminal airborne radios, which will be integrated onto a growing number of diversified air platforms across an expanding customer base. And following the close of the quarter, Public Safety was awarded a $75 million contract from a utility company to upgrade a legacy analog system to a P25 digital network. Space and Intelligence Systems on slide 6. Segment operating income in the quarter was up 1% and revenue down 3%, compared to prior year as higher revenue from intelligence community was more than offset by few environmental and space programs that have transitioned from development to sustainment. Year-to-date revenue is up 2% with operating income up 11%, resulting in margin expansion of 130 basis points from 15.2% to 16.5%, driven by solid program execution and higher pension income. Book-to-bill was more than 1 for the quarter, driven by strong bookings from our classified customers. This quarter, the classified business received a $500 million, single-award IDIQ contract from National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, with an initial task order of $15 million to perform search and retrieval services for geospatial products. We also received $28 million and $18 million in follow-on contracts to support U.S. missile warning, missile defense, and space surveillance missions under the SENSOR program. Electronic Systems on slide 7. Electronic Systems now includes the financial results of the air traffic management business that remains with Harris after the IT Services divestiture. Segment operating income in the quarter was up 4% on flat organic revenue compared to prior year as higher revenue from electronic warfare solutions and the continued ramp of UAE integrated battle management system was offset by lower revenue from wireless products and the ADSC (13:36) program transition from build-out to sustainment. Year-to-date revenue is up 3%, with operating income up 12%, resulting in margin expansion of 170 basis points from 20% to 21.7%, driven by solid program execution, a contract adjustment in the second quarter, and higher pension income. Book-to-bill was slightly below 1 for the quarter, with strong bookings in avionics and air traffic management, including a $72 million follow-on contract to provide engineering services for next-generation air traffic management weather initiatives, and a $72 million follow-on contract for Sonobuoy Launching Systems for the U.S. Navy's P-8 antisubmarine aircraft. Additionally, we've received a $25 million follow-on contract from the U.S. Air Force for electronic warfare demonstrations. Moving to slide 8 and 9 for fiscal 2017 guidance. Given our year-to-date performance, we now expect organic revenue down about 1% for the year at the midpoint of the previous guidance, excluding prior-year revenue from the Aerostructures business. Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance, which excludes Exelis acquisition-related integration and other charges, has been narrowed from a range of $5.40 to $5.60 to a range of $5.50 to $5.55. As previously communicated, full-year EPS guidance reflects about $700 million in share repurchases for the year, as well as an effective non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%. In segment guidance, margins now reflect the reallocation of FAS pension income, stranded cost and the accounting of discontinued operations related to the CapRock and IT services divestitures. These reallocations differ by segment resulting in modest impact to segment margins. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be down about 7% versus down 7% to 9% in the previous guidance, with Harris legacy tactical now down low to mid-single digits. Segment operating margins are now expected to be about 30%. In Space and Intelligence Systems, we now expect revenue to be about flat versus up 1% to 3% in the previous guidance. While classified business remained strong, it is offset by some task orders and commercial awards that have shifted to their right (16:10). Segment operating margins are now expected to be about 16.5%. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be up about 3% at the midpoint of the previous guidance. We continue to see strong growth in electronic warfare, F-35 UAE battle management programs, partially offset by softness in wireless products and the ADS-B program. Segment operating margins are now expected to be about 20.5%. Free cash flow guidance of approximately $800 million is unchanged. This guidance excludes pension pre-funding, which will be reported in operating cash flow. This pre-funding is in addition to our annual contribution of approximately $188 million for a total pension contribution of approximately $588 million for fiscal 2017. As I mentioned last quarter, this contribution fully funds our pension on an IRS basis and eliminates mandatory contributions of about $200 million for the next few years. During the third quarter, we launched a $350 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR program and we'll initiate an additional $250 million ASR program in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to repurchase about $700 million of shares this fiscal year. On slide 10, we have provided historical financials of the business on a continuing operations basis that reflect reallocations of stranded cost and FAS pension to the three-segment structure. We will also be filing an 8-K with restated total company financials. And with that, let me turn to the operator to open the line for questions. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Chanel, we are open for questions. Operator : And our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky [Citigroup]. Your line is now open. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Jason. Good morning. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes discussing, with a little bit more detail, the comment that you made about the Space Systems pipeline of $11 billion. Can you just talk a little bit about where that pipeline is from an end market perspective, and the cadence that you expect on those awards over the next couple of years, and when that revenue stream might actually begin to accrue to the company? Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure, Jason. Thanks for the question. Yes, so we're very pleased with where the pipeline happens to be. It's pretty significant. Again, it's up about 8% year-over-year. Keep in mind that Space and Intel business is about two-thirds in the classified space, and those budgets are just becoming revealed as we see what's coming through the Omnibus. So, we know that there's been strong support for the program that we happen to be on. Opportunity will come to fruition over the next several years. Our win rate in that segment is very, very high. It's north of 70%. So, we feel good when we see the sort of size of the pipeline growing, with us entering new mission areas. And the high level of our successive win rates, we feel pretty confident those opportunity to materialize over the next several years. I really can't characterize exactly when that might happen, but we do know that those will happen over the next several years. They come in a bunch of different areas. There's a number of classified programs on the ground side, and we talked about winning a pretty significant ground adjacency very recently. There's been a lot of attention and a lot of focus on space superiority, significant investments in protecting our overhead architecture, and Harris is in the middle of that. We've also had some substantial wins in our ground sustainment program, we call SENSOR. That's coming through performing exceptionally well on the task orders. We bought Exelis as a program that was legacy Exelis, the delivery rate was something like around 30%. This past quarter, it was about 100%, so we feel very, very good about that. So, there's been lots of really good performance, and I think we're executing very, very well. And on the commercial side, we've seen a couple of the reflectors that had slipped out of the year going into fiscal 2018; but our commercial space, the reflector business, also looks pretty robust. We see at least 10 different opportunities over the next 24 months coming to fruition. Our win rate there is actually quite high as well. So, that's maybe a little bit more color, Jason. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. That's great. And then, maybe just one number-related question is, when you get close to return to growth here over the next year or so. Can you talk a little bit about the impacts of that growth on working capital, and whether we should expect working capital to become a source or a use of cash as you return to growth? That's it for me. Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Well, thank you for that. In fact, we've seen \u2013 so far, year-to-date, we've seen working capital build, even though our revenue is down a little bit. We do expect in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 for that to reverse, which would get us to our $800 million target for the year in free cash flow. And that's with about \u2013 in the high-40%s in terms of days of net working capital, so pretty good step-down from where we were at the end of Q3, but in line with, or maybe a little bit better than where we were ending in fiscal 2016. And we do see a little bit more opportunity with that so, it will be important for us to keep managing our working capital levels very, very aggressively as we return to growth over the next three years. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Your line is now open. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. And congrats on getting all these transactions done. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Carter. Good morning. Thank you. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Bill, I wanted to just ask a clarification to start off. You may have commented about fiscal 2018 being an inflection point, and the repos offsetting the divestiture, dilution, and cost savings. But I just want to \u2013 just wanted to clarify that you still expect to organically grow EBIT as we transition to next year, and that's part of that inflection? And the other thing I wanted to ask about was, just in terms of the order momentum in legacy tactical, I know the revenues have been strong in Europe, but maybe if you could speak to the \u2013 what the book-to-bill looks like there, and maybe also hit in international, the kind of the latest color on Australia, which I know is still sitting out there? Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Carter, I think you covered quite the gamut on that one. So, let me start with the first one. Yeah, we do expect to return to top line organic growth next year, and there's a number of contributors to earning per share next year. Certainly revenue's going to be one, we continue to drive hard on our OpEx agenda. We typically take out 2% to 3% net of cost every year, in terms of normal operational excellence and that will be a contributor \u2013 certainly the share repo that we're doing now will be a contributor going into next year. We don't see as much pension tailwind. We don't see as much synergy tailwind as we saw this year. So there's lots of puts and takes, but we do expect to grow earnings per share into fiscal 2018. Maybe I'll start, and maybe Rahul can jump in a little bit on the tactical side. We saw a very good momentum through the year in our legacy tactical business. Europe has been a very, very strong performer for us this year and it keeps getting incrementally better. A lot of it is in Eastern Europe. I mentioned a few countries that were important in the quarter. Poland, Romania, they remain important. Ukraine was in the earlier part of this year. So, we feel very good about that. The Central American and Latin American region also remains very, very strong for us. The offsetting areas remains Central Asia, where it's in a transition period. It's very low. It's a lot of headwind for us this year. Not seeing that that's going to (25:45) turn around into next year. The Middle East has been soft, but we're starting to see some glimpses as some orders flow through there, we saw some even in early April some movement and some good support on what it seems so far in the Omnibus. So, we're seeing good support for our international business, and I'm encouraged with the trends. We do expect for a company to end with a book-to-bill about one, as well as NCS (26:13) as well as within the tactical business. And an important part of that is Australia. As Australia comes through at the back end of the year, you will be well above one in the tactical business. We still think we get about one even with Australian doesn't book. So in Australia, the opportunity is just under $300 million. So, that $250 million to $300 million range is part of the $1 billion-plus multi-year opportunity in Australia. We're deep in contract negotiations with them. It's going to happen right at the back end of our fiscal year, so the end of June, and we're tracking towards that. You'll be given any big international opportunity. It could slip into July or August, but we're right on the edge of that. We're in deep negotiations. It's going to come to us. We know the size. The scope has been now well defined, so we feel very good about the progress now in Australia. So, I think I hit on the points. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah, you did. And I'll say on Communication Systems, Carter, the other part of the growth next year would be in the Electronic Systems space. Bill mentioned the opportunities on the EW platform with F-16s and F-18. So we expect electronic warfare to continue to grow and the C4, the battle management system win in UAE is going to drive growth in our C4I business, so those would be the other two contributors for growth in fiscal 2018. Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the color, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, good morning, guys, nice quarter. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Bill, one top level type of question. I'm just curious as to your thinking as you kind of finish up fiscal 2017 here as a more focused defense electronics company. And it seems like the budget is starting to improve your visibility. Why is it so? I'm just trying to get a sense from you in terms of how you think about the company growth-wise, just notionally over the next few years whether or not we'll get the DoD budget outlook. And do you think you can outgrow the DoD budget growth more in line or for whatever reason below that? I'm just curious as to how you think about the company at this point? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I think I would say once we see where the President is going over the next five years, what we've seen so far is a 2017 Omnibus that's apparently going to go to his desk at the end of this week and some indicators, some high-level indicators for the shape of a budget in 2018, which certainly shows the DoD with substantial growth, DHS with substantial growth. We think the Intel budget is going to comp a lot, at the offset of some other parts of the government. So, there's a lot of room between now and then and really understanding the 2018 budget, how it's shaped and then beyond that. But I would say, Pete, given everything that I've seen, in fact, anything was viewed (29:04) of the budget even under the sequester (29:05), we'll see the DoD budgets getting better. So we're at a great point. We've worked very, very hard as a team to streamline our portfolio into businesses where technology can differentiate where we have good strong positions in businesses that are aligned very clearly with where the DoD and our customers are moving with key mission needs. So we feel very good about where we happen to be. I mentioned this last time. I think the fact that the portfolio is more streamlined allows the management team to focus more on businesses where we know we can drive shareholder value. And I don't want to understate that. I think that's a very, very important part of this whole dynamic of shaping of our portfolio. So we all feel good. We feel good we're set up to grow in 2018 and beyond. We still have opportunity to do better on productivity. That's an everyday event, but I'm pleased with how we've executed on the portfolio of transformation. I'm pleased with how we've executed on Exelis integration, the investments we've made in R&D to position ourselves for growth at the time when the budgets are inflecting. So, I think all things are looking very positive for the company. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, great. And I'll just ask one quick program \u2013 question. I'm not sure if you mentioned enough. This new one, the SOCOM wideband HF Manpack, do you have kind of a sense of a schedule for that program? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's going to follow the SOCOM Manpack program, which we are now in \u2013 we put in our final offer very, very recently. We expected award on that this summer. The HF program will come behind that. It's part of three different programs for SOCOM, handheld, the Manpack and the HF radio that it's been estimated that will be $900 million of opportunity. Obviously, we won the sole-source single \u2013 two-channel handheld. We're in the mix on the Manpack. And frankly, on the HF side, Pete, that's a position where we've launched some products recently with NSA certification. We have a very, very high share of the global market on HF, so we feel very good about our prospects on that radio as well. More to come as we get through the Manpack. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. Bill, now that you've finished with \u2013 or you've largely finished with Exelis, I recognize you don't rest and you're going to do something next. How do you \u2013 and these other reshaping of the enterprise. So how do you think about some of the operating targets that you won? And where do you expect you might be able to find some incremental synergies or other operational efficiencies in the enterprise? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, look, I mean in terms of just our focus right now is delivering against guidance here in 2017 and making sure that we're set up to deliver growth in top line and bottom line in cash next year and capture all of the opportunity that we think we can capture within the budget as they're being shaped. I really like where the portfolio happens to be. Going back five years, I think the step we took to invest more in IRAD, when most people are pulling back, if you just go back five years, we're up about $100 million a year incrementally in IRAD in this company and that is in all the different franchise programs that we're now set up to perform on. In fact, a lot of the wins we're seeing come from some of the investments we've made over the last three years to five years. So, I feel very good about where we happen to be. There is always more to do on the cost side, as I mentioned a minute ago. Our operational excellence agenda is maturing. We're sort of four years, five years into it with a decade-long journey. There's lots of more things that we can do including streamlining and simplifying a lot of our systems across the company. So there's a lot more that we can do. I think we're set up to continue to perform into the future. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: And just to add to that, Howard, where we're focused on the Exelis side is driving integration. I think the next part of the journey would be taking this HPX culture. The build's been (33:20) driving on the legacy Harris side now into Exelis, and we see some really good opportunities to continue to simplify operations and streamline the business there on the Exelis side. So there should be some cost take-out opportunities on the Exelis side going forward as well. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : I mean I think the SENSOR program is probably one of the best examples of that whole process, and my guess also is moving Fort Wayne to Rochester is similar. Just as a follow-up, now that you're \u2013 just on two products, one on FAA. As you transition to ADS-B to maintenance, I mean I believe you have the opportunity to sell the data, and then also could you just talk for a moment about the evolution of GPS III and the opportunities there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, sure. Let me start on the FAA side. So you're right. I mean the ADS-B system, we own about 640, 650 towers. It was built by the Exelis team. That build-out is complete. It's now in a sustainment mode and we do own the data rights on ADS-B. The equipage today, I think, is just over 2,000 aircraft right now, so it's not \u2013 and all the aircraft have to be fully equipped by early 2020, so we're still on the front end of the evolution of that business and that marketplace. I think where there's an opportunity going forward is now trying to use that broad array of towers to enable the UAS into \u2013 UAVs into the North American airspace system. That I think could be an important and distinctive technology for allowing UAVs into NASA (35:11). So I think there's some encouragement on that piece. On GPS III, as you know, Howard, we're under contract for space vehicles 1 through 10. 9 and 10 were awarded late last year. For long-lead materials we see some other opportunities for 9 and 10 coming up very shortly maybe this quarter. 11 through 32 is being competed. It's a two-phase process. There's three different bidders on that. We partnered up with Lockheed who is our \u2013 who will be providing the payload today on GPS III. So again, it's in two phases. There's a first phase, a production readiness with some small amount of money and then it goes to a more substantial competition. I think the award is some time out in the spring of 2019 and it's likely to be of those 20 space vehicles, 10 awards, maybe 10 auctioned. We are developing a fully digital payload for that, so it's not \u2013 we'll provide today to GPS III not fully digital, but we're investing in that, and we expect to be a player and supporter for Lockheed on 11 through 32. Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure, Howard. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Australia award and how quickly you expect it to convert to revenue, A); B), given you now have more color on the scope, what the anticipated margin profile of that program is going to be relative to the rest of the legacy tactical comms? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Look, the Australia program, first of all, is, we've been in some very detailed negotiations with them for some period of time. We're in the phase 3 of a multi-year phase. It's a broader systems offering. We have a number of people on our team. I mean, again, we're expecting an award on this and order booking towards the end of our fiscal year. It'll be again $250 million to $300 million. We'll see revenue flowing off on that program over the next, probably three years or so. And the margins are, I think, pretty strong. So I don't really want to say specifically where we happen to be. But they remain pretty strong in that program, and really any of the systems programs that we happen to have inside the company. So I don't see any sort of pressure on the CS segment going forward because of the Australia margins. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And so, to your point, though, it will deliver over three years. It's not like a quick turn type of order. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: It would be. Gautam, it's something that the pieces \u2013 there are two pieces. There is system integration and then providing the radios as well, in that order. So \u2013 yeah, so I think we should be able to get revenue from that in 2018. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Secondly, could you give us \u2013 in prior periods, you've sometimes given your pipeline figures for DoD and international, RF tactical. Do you have those numbers? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Do you have them handy? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah. So on the international side, Gautam, our pipeline is pretty steady. I mean it's around the same $2.4 billion-ish where it has been. It kind of keeps moving in and out with opportunities coming. So there is really not a lot of change to the international pipeline. And the typical areas that it comes from is also kind of the same. Iraq continues to be one of our bigger opportunities. And then Australia, we're still tracking that. As we mentioned before, that's a \u2013 long-term, that's about a $1 billion opportunity with, obviously, the upfront award. So the geographical distribution has not changed much. The size overall has not changed much. And I think, on the DoD, the pipeline is up slightly over where we were. I think it's now north of about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. And so that's where that thing is, and I think that's up over where we were last time. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And on Iraq, in prior years, I remember, I think, it was the December quarter a couple \u2013 a year ago \u2013 you had a $66 million order. Could you frame for us how big the Iraq opportunity still remains to be, and what you anticipate booking in the next 12 months with Iraq? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We do see a couple of opportunities moving down the path in Iraq, Gautam. I mean, I'm not sure we'll give you specific to a country in the next couple of months. I mean, I think, just to step back a little bit, Iraq is still a very big opportunity in our large pipeline, and Rahul just went through about $2.4 billion. Iraq is on the order of about $0.5 billion, so it's a very big opportunity. Those \u2013 you know, they're starting to move through the pipeline. I was very encouraged to see, in the Omnibus, continued support for, they call it now, counter ISIL train and equip (40:24), but there's also an Iraq train and equip (40:26) fund that was set aside, with substantial amount of money that expires at the end of this fiscal year. So by September, it was something like $300 million. So, there remains good support by the U.S. Government for equipping in Iraq. So we still see that to be a big opportunity, and it's going to materialize over the next \u2013 probably couple of years, that's really the shape of our pipeline. I don't think I want to call it anytime in the next couple of months. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And just last one, do you have any preliminary view on how much legacy RF tactical could grow in fiscal 2018? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I don't think we're going to comment on 2018 as a whole, or even a specific sub-segment of the company. As we said before, we do expect that 2018 will be a growth year for the company, and I'll leave it at that. I think you could see the trends in what's happening in the DoD budgets and where we happen to be as a DoD tactical business. But I don't think we'll comment on a specific business until we get out and close on 2017 and shape the whole company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: All right. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, thanks very much, and good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Bill, I heard you say that you're still expecting a selection on Manpack in the summer. Are you still expecting orders and shipments by late in the calendar year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes, Seth, there's two \u2013 I use the word Manpack loosely, there's two Manpacks. One is one for SOCOM. And we have put in our final proposal the award we expected this summer, it will go into a developing phase and we see revenue coming off of that more likely in our fiscal 2019, not 2018. On the (42:23) Manpack, is now into customer testing and there's three vendors on that. We think our offering has performed and performing very, very well. The Army has recently told us that there will be now two steps. They expect that they're going to have an interim field-based risk reduction step in order to verify some of those deferred threshold requirements, and we expect an order of about 150 units more or less in our fourth quarter, same order for (42:57) the other two players in the space, it will get delivered at the end of the calendar year or go into some additional testing. And then what now they're expecting is that there will be an order for now up to six but Brigade Combat Teams, or BCTs, versus the original two that will be split between two vendors. So it's a total of 3,800 radios, 1,900 apiece. That will be awarded sometime in the February-March of calendar 2018 period, which will be revenue for us as being one of the two vendors at the back end of our fiscal 2018. So, a little bit of a shift on the Army Manpack program, again, very, very encouraging that the testing goes on, we're performing very well. The money is in the budget which is very encouraging, what we saw in the Omnibus, as well as a substantial increase in the number of BCTs that are going to be fielded by the Army from the Manpack program. So I think that's very encouraging news to us. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. That's very helpful. And second question on air traffic control, how do you think about the impact of potential privatization on Harris, or is there any impact? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yes, well, Seth, well, thanks for that question. The FAA is one of our biggest customers across the company. It's more than $0.5 billion. It's a very large partnership, significant partnership we've had with them and it's been for the last couple of decades. As you know, we have the base FTI program which has been very stable. They've been (44:29) for a long period of time performing exceptionally well and then a number of NextGen programs. I think, look, there's been a lot of debate. It's not a new debate. It's been happening over the last, probably, couple of decades. I think what's different now is, it appears the administration is now getting behind privatization. I think if it goes in that direction, the transition period is probably at least five years because of the size and complexity of the FAA system, the North American Air Traffic Control System. So I think it's a multi-year transition. We don't think that there's going to be any near-term impact mainly because the programs that we're on are essential programs. There's very strong support for the NextGen programs, including in the recent Omnibus. All of the airlines even support the NextGen programs. So, we feel very good that we will not be impacted, certainly not anytime in the near-term, by any discussion on privatization, but I can tell you there's a lot of distance between now and having that finally approved. There's a lots of different voices in this including from the general aviation community, the DoD. A lot of people who have airports in their backyard that won't let them (45:44) impacted. So there's a lot of room between now and something being definitize on privatization, so we'll watch and see how it plays out and keep you posted on it. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Bill, you mentioned that there'd been some impact of the CR in the quarter. It might be tough, but can you sort of size what you think the impact could have been across your various businesses over the last three months? And then perhaps, more importantly, when do you think it could be caught back up? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, look, we've calibrated pretty well in the year based on the CR, so we felt our tactical business was well calibrated and coming in today, keeping the DoD about flat for the year sort of is testament of the fact that it was reasonably well calibrated. In our Electronic Systems business, we have our wireless products. (46:46) more of a short-term product type business, has seen a little bit of an impact but not enough to take us off our game in Electronic Systems. So we feel that our business and where we happen to be has been well calibrated. We originally guided at the beginning of the year flat to down 2 (47:05) as a company and now we're down about 1 (47:07), so right in the middle of the range. So I think we have been well calibrated and I think that remains the same today. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on the numbers, it looks like the Exelis integration costs have moved up a little bit by $5 million for the full year. I was wondering if you could comment on what's behind that. And then looking into next year, what sort of level of integration costs you might be expecting for the next 12 months? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Most of the integration costs are going to be behind us by the end of the year. The total for the program is about $250 million. Most of that's now spent. Net is going to be about $200 million. So it's up a little bit. It was $35 million and now it's about $40 million. It's restructuring. It's integration costs and a little bit of restructuring around the stranded cost reduction activities, but we think we're pretty well captured in that $40 million estimate. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So, just to make a final point on that, Rob, the step-up is not due to Exelis integration costs going up. But we'd mentioned last quarter that as we were taking some stranded costs, now there'll be some restructuring costs, that we'll need to spend to get the stranded costs out and that's what you see the change from $35 million to $40 million. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. And any more of this activity still to go on next fiscal year? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: We should be pretty much done by the end of this fiscal year, so we do not expect any integration costs too for next year. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Josh. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Just on international radios and I guess particularly in Europe, I know you mentioned Eastern Europe is a source of strength, but are you seeing any increased fly activity from other core native allies, maybe as they look to increase defense spending? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: A little bit. It's not a lot we do \u2013 I think that directionally it's \u2013 the words from the administration are good, as there's pressure on NATO to spend more, we do see some incremental opportunities coming from our allies in Western Europe. We have a few small orders, nothing big at this point coming from Western Europe. And that market is fairly stable year-over-year, so not a lot of change on the Western Europe side. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: But over time, we know that there will be a substantial upgrade in the UK, this Morpheus program, and we're going to be right in the middle of that. There's been some recent progress on that. That is going to move forward. It's probably not in the next two years, but certainly in the next three years or four years, we'll be able to start (49:58) to be some meaningful revenue for Harris and that will happen and that's going to be a big opportunity. It was estimated as a \u00a33.5 billion total upgrade. About 20%, 25% is going to be radio. So we think we've got a good position on that because we've 40,000 radio there today, legacy radios, so a good opportunity for us. Over time, it's probably in the back end of the three-year period that we're thinking when it's going to start to hit us. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on electronic warfare. You mentioned some expectations for growth, but how do you balance between maybe some of the legacy programs and the F-35, if there were any changes to production volumes on either legacy programs or the F-35, are you more exposed one way or the other? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I think more broadly, so just electronic warfare, we do have substantial content on F-35. It's not the EW system, it's on F-35, so very substantial content with opportunities to grow that content over time because we're performing very, very well. And as there's a broad multi-year drive in the DoD towards open systems, we do have some opportunities to perhaps get a little more content there. We also have significant content with the F-18. So, as there's a contemplation certainly in the Omnibus of additional F-18 aircraft, that works for us. We do have the IDECM system for the \u2013 the Defense Electronic Countermeasure System for the F-18, so that will be good news for us. And then what we're seeing is across all of the legacy platforms, because of new threats, all of the legacy platforms, both fixed wing and rotary, need to be upgraded, and we've got strong positions on many of those platforms, and that's really what's behind a lot of the strong order growth and revenue growth now in electronic warfare. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, everyone. Go ahead. Chanel...

LLC Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President, Investor Relations. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Victoria. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris' SEC filings. In addition, discussions today will include non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal 2017 on a high note, with fourth quarter earnings per share up 15% on top-line growth of about 1%. For the year, earnings per share was up 8% to $5.53, on organic revenue down about 0.5%. Despite slightly lower revenue, we expanded operating margins 50 basis points to 19.2% and generated record free cash flow of $850 million, 123% of income which is well above our guidance of $800 million. Total company book-to-bill was 1.02, driving increasing backlog and setting us up for return to growth in fiscal 2018. On each of our quarterly calls this year, I've updated you on our progress against strategic priorities. So, let me just quickly recap the key highlights for the year. We successfully divested CapRock and IT services with combined revenue of $1.4 billion. The sale of these two non-core businesses generated more than $1 billion of net proceeds. We completed Exelis integration, achieving $145 million of net annual run rate savings versus our initial estimate of $100 million to $120 million. Integration concluded a full year ahead of our original baseline plan, without any business disruption and while also making operational improvements in several Exelis' business areas including the SENSOR program, GPS III and Night Vision. We generated a record $850 million of free cash, which when combined with divesture proceeds, netted over $1.9 billion of cash inflow. We returned almost half of that cash or about $900 million to shareholders through the largest stock repurchase program in our history and dividends, which increased 6% in fiscal 2017, and 17% annually over the last decade. The remaining half of that cash we used to de-risk the balance sheet in two ways. First, we paid down debt by $575 million, bringing our total debt repayment since the Exelis acquisition to $1.3 billion and tracking to our debt reduction commitment by the end of fiscal 2018. Second, we prefunded our pension with $400 million, which creates future cash flow flexibility, and when combined with asset returns, as we reduced our pension deficit by $1 billion or about 40% in the last year to now $1.3 billion. And then finally, we continued to invest in technology, spending about 5% of sales on internal R&D and leading to several new product launches and strategic program wins in fiscal 2017. In Communication Systems, we've swept recent DoD modernization awards, earning a position on all five programs over the last four years, with the latest being a $255 million sole-source IDIQ from SOCOM for the next-generation multi-channel manpack radio. In Electronic Systems, we strengthened our EW position on legacy platforms and were recently selected for a critical role providing phased array antennas for the C-130J RF Countermeasures system. And through our investments in open systems, we've increased our content on the F-35 with recent wins to provide the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit as part of Tech Refresh 3. These two wins continue to demonstrate our ability to provide innovative solutions and position us well for future opportunities as the F-35 and other platforms move towards open architecture systems. And in Space and Intel, our investment in advanced space technology has enabled us to launch hosted payloads including an ADS-B transponder and other sensors on the Iridium NEXT satellite, which will provide persistent real-time tracking of ships and aircraft globally. Over the next two years, more than 200 of Harris' reprogrammable hosted payloads will be flying on this new Iridium constellation. This IRAD investment has also allowed us to win two classified small sat programs in the last year, while we launch our own multi-purpose small sat as a capability demonstration and risk reduction effort. This sets the foundation to capitalize on future small sat growth as the government and commercial markets move towards more disaggregated and affordable space solutions. Rahul will walk through the details of fiscal 2017 results, but overall, we've had a milestone year in which we've reshaped the company, while delivering strong financial and operating performance and returning record cash to shareholders. For fiscal 2018, we expect to continue to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, growing revenue across all three segments, maintaining margins through operational excellence and maximizing cash flow with balanced capital deployment. For the year, we expect earnings per share up 6% to 9% on revenue growth of 2% to 4%, and another year of record free cash flow. As we've all seen in the fiscal 2017 Omnibus as well as the 2018 President's budget request and Congressional marks, the U.S. government funding outlook is improving and the vast majority of Harris programs are well supported, in particular within the DoD for our tactical business and in the intelligence community budgets. Internationally, we see similar trends towards modernization of capabilities and increased defense spending. These global trends coupled with our positions on growing platforms and important mission areas are translating into a very robust set of opportunities spanning all segments, resulting in an overall Harris pipeline that is up double digits over the past year to more than $30 billion. A final comment before turning the call over to Rahul. I know there's been a lot of recent press coverage about the Army reevaluating a tactical network architecture, a process that Harris is deeply involved in and supportive of, and I remain confident that the Army will move forward on upgrading the lower tactical tier, including the manpack and handheld programs. There is a need to replace legacy SINCGARS radios with modern, multi-channel radios that could simultaneously transmit voice and data, are software upgradable over time, meet new mandated NSA crypto standards and can interoperate with other U.S. and coalition forces. These are undisputed requirements, and our products are ready today. The procurement process continues to advance, funding has increased in the 2017 and 2018 budgets and just yesterday, we received the delivery order for an additional 101 radios, which allows the Army to test deferred threshold and operational requirements before moving to full-rate production in the first half of calendar 2018. So, let me turn it over to Rahul to walk through the financial results and fiscal 2018 guidance, and then I'll share some further thoughts about our medium-term outlook. Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude Exelis integration and other costs. Turning now to segment details on slide 6. Communication Systems revenue in the quarter was $449 million, up 3% versus prior year. Operating income for the segment was up 22%, resulting in margin expansion of 500 basis points from higher tactical radio volume, integration savings and the benefits of operational excellence initiatives. Legacy tactical revenue grew 28% in the quarter and was about flat for the year versus previous guidance of down low-single digits and down high-single digits at the beginning of the year. This strong performance in legacy Tactical resulted in full year segment revenue down 6% versus our previous guidance of down 7%. Following the end of the CR, DoD tactical procurement picked up with the Air Force placing a $23 million order for radios for MRAP vehicles, and we ended the full year revenue growth of 3%, better than our previous expectation of flat revenues. In international Tactical, revenue was up 37% in the quarter over a relatively weak compare from last year. As expected, Eastern Europe continues to be an area of strength and we also saw positive signs in the Middle East with an order from Iraq and growth in the Asia Pacific region. Improving conditions in the international tactical market throughout the year resulted in full year revenue being down 1% versus our prior expectation of a mid single-digit decline and a mid-teens decline at the beginning of the year. Regarding the Australia opportunity, in June, we have received a $19 million order to conduct risk reduction and planning activity for Australia's Phase 3 modernization program. And in mid-July, the program was approved by Australia's DoD Investment Committee. Following that, letter of intent was issued to Harris for an order of approximately $260 million for part of the Phase 3 modernization. This order is expected sometime later in the first quarter. For full year fiscal 2017, segment revenue was $1.75 billion with operating margin of 29.9%, up 80 basis points versus prior year. This margin improvement was driven by synergies and the team's continued focus on cost and operational excellence. Book-to-bill for the segment was well above 1 in the quarter, with strong bookings in PSPC and legacy Exelis Signal and greater than 1 for the year even with Australia moving base to the right. In Public Safety, although revenue was down 8% in the quarter and down 5% for the year, we had a solid book-to-bill driven by a $75 million contract from a utility company to upgrade the legacy analog system to a digital network. Additionally in July, Public Safety was awarded a five-year, $461 million IDIQ contract with an initial $10 million order from the U.S. Army to upgrade and modernize existing land mobile radio infrastructure. Electronic Systems on slide 7. Electronic Systems was up 4% for the quarter and the year versus full year expectation of up 3%, driven by continued strength in electronic warfare, the ramp of UAE battle management system and a strong fourth quarter in avionics. Operating income in the quarter declined 15% as the ADS-B program continues to transition from build-out to sustainment. For full year fiscal 2017, operating income was up 5% with margin expansion of 30 basis points from 20.3% to 20.6%, driven by solid program execution, a contract adjustment in the second quarter, and higher pension income. This was partially offset by the ADS-B program transition. Book-to-bill was slightly than 1 for the quarter, but above 1 for the year. In addition to the new avionic content wins in F-35 that Bill spoke about, the avionics business also received a $30 million order from the Navy for 300 ejector racks for F-18s, and an initial $10 million order to develop ejector systems on the Korean Next-Gen Indigenous Fighter with significant future production potentials. We also continued to see positive momentum in other parts of the segment, including $64 million order for the U.S. Army's MET terminals and a $36 million award to implement surveillance capability at seven airports. Space and Intelligence Systems on slide 8. Revenue in Space and Intel was down 4% for the quarter and as expected was about flat for the year. We saw continued solid demand in the classified programs, offset by the wind down of some environmental programs, particularly in the back half of the year. Segment operating income in the quarter was flat. The full year fiscal 2017 revenue was about flat, operating income was up 8% with margin expansion of 120 basis points from 15.2% to 16.4%, driven by solid program execution and higher pension income. Book-to-bill was slightly less than 1 for the quarter and the year while we continued to see strong bookings from our classified customers, including for space superiority programs like the SENSOR contract, where we received additional orders of $63 million from the U.S. airports. In other areas, we received a $51 million production order for payloads on GPS III vehicles 9 and 10, and a $32 million follow-on contract for the GOES-R program. Moving to slide 10 for fiscal 2018 guidance, today, we initiated fiscal 2018 revenue guidance in the range of $6.02 billion to $6.14 billion, up 2% to 4% for the year, and EPS in the range of $5.85 to $6.05, up 6% to 9%. We expect total company margin to be between 19% and 19.5%. Fiscal 2018 EPS guidance reflects about $150 million in share repurchases for the year and an effective tax rate of 28.5%. 2018 tax rate is consistent with our performance in fiscal 2017 and reflects the effect of the stock compensation accounting change which we adopted in fiscal 2017 and the benefits of various tax planning activities. We also expect to pay down $600 million of debt in fiscal 2018, which will achieve our debt repayment commitment and we would not expect any further net reduction in debt over the medium term. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. We ended fiscal 2017 with working capital of 43 days, a six-day improvement over 2016. And fiscal 2018 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance and capital expenditures of about $130 million. For segment guidance, growth in all the segments. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5%, with DoD up double digits, from growth in modernization revenue and International about flat to down modestly. Modernization growth in DoD will primarily be in the second half of the year, as we start to ship handheld radios for the Special Forces and manpack for the Army. The guidance for DoD and International includes both legacy Harris and Exelis product line, reflecting the integration of the two legacy operations and our current management of the business. Slide 14 provides historical orders, revenue and backlog for the combined legacy Harris and Exelis businesses, which we expect to report on a consolidated basis going forward. Public Safety is expected to be about flat. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the impact of new program starts and incremental systems work, offset by benefits from operational excellence programs and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory. Electronic Systems revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5% driven by higher avionics revenue from backlog growth in fiscal 2017, strong electronic warfare revenue and the continued ramp of international battlefield management system. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 19% and 20%, reflecting the remaining transition of the ADS-B program from build-out to sustainment, partially offset by volume growth and additional pension income. In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue is expected to be flat to up 1%. Classified business representing about two-thirds of the segment is expected to grow mid single-digits as we leverage (18:42) synergies between Harris and Exelis, build on strong customer relationships and benefit from growth in the intelligence budget. However, this growth will be partially offset by program transitions and incremental budget softness in the environmental business, which is expected to last for most fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 16.5% and 17.5%, reflecting operational efficiencies and additional pension income. Turning now to fiscal 2018 EPS bridge on slide 11. We expect the ADS-B transition to bring EPS down by $0.22. We started seeing the impact of the transition in the second half of 2017 and it will continue through first half of 2018. This headwind will be mitigated by lower share count and interest expense from our capital allocation actions in fiscal 2017. Increase in segment operating income from higher volume operational efficiency savings and increase in pension income will contribute an additional $0.30 to $0.50 to EPS, resulting in EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.05. With that, let me now turn it back to Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay, well. Thank you, Rahul. I wanted to close out our prepared remarks with a few comments on our growth outlook beyond fiscal 2018, given what we're hearing from customers about mission and funding priorities and potential budget trajectories. As indicated on slide 12, we expect top line growth to accelerate in almost every one of our businesses beyond 2018. In Communication Systems, we expect to start seeing the benefits of DoD modernizations towards the back half of fiscal 2018, which will continue to ramp in fiscal 2019 and beyond. Our International Tactical business began to stabilize over the past six months and we expect to return to growth in the medium-term as the Middle East comes out of a trough and Australia and UK modernizations get underway. The growth in the tactical business coupled with a modest recovery in Night Vision and Public Safety, will lead to accelerating mid-single digit growth in the segment. In Electronic Systems, we see growth across the board. Our electronic warfare business has a solid and growing pipeline of upgrade opportunities on international F-16, plus upgrade and new builds on U.S. and international F-18s. In avionics, we'll benefit from the volume ramp and new content wins on F-35, plus new platform wins in classified areas, KFX (21:18) and others that are still being competed. In C4I, we have the opportunity to significantly increase scope on the current battlefield management project in the UAE and leverage that success to expand to other Gulf countries. In mission networks, which include our air traffic management business, while we see near-term pressure from the ADS-B transition, it will be offset in the medium-term by International growth. As a result, we expect the strong momentum in Electronic Systems to accelerate to mid-to-high single-digits. In Space and Intel, we continue to see strong and accelerated growth in the classified area, driven by budget increases and expansion in the new adjacencies. We also expect increasing momentum in commercial space from recapitalizations. Growth in classified and commercial along with better compare in environmental and other civil areas, including a win on the recompete of GPS III 11 plus will drive low-to-mid single-digit growth for the segment. Overall, the combination of our strong competitive position and inflecting budgets along with continued excellent operational execution will drive mid single-digit top line growth, higher earnings and a $1 billion in free cash flow. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. The first question is from Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is open. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Jason. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I was wondering, Rahul, if you could just provide for us in terms of bridge between net income and cash flows this year, talk a little bit about some of the moving pieces on working capital. I know you guys have been working hard to drive better efficiency there, so just kind of what's baked into guidance for this year? And then, maybe some comments on the longer-term outlook on working capital and maybe how much more we have to go on getting efficient there? Thanks. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So your question, Jason, was on the fiscal 2017 free cash flow or fiscal 2018? Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: 2018, I'm sorry. Yeah, to be clear, 2018. Yeah. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. So the big thing \u2013 so there are two ways to look at this, Jason, one going from kind of 2017 to 2018. The big piece is we were targeting about three days improvement in working capital, and we got six. So, it was slightly increased benefit from working capital in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2018. And most of that was driven by some collections that we are forecasting in July that came in early in June. So that creates a little bit of headwind for us. Also keep in mind that our revenue is growing up. So, as we continue to improve working capital base, the contribution from working capital in dollars will not be that much. So, as we look from 2017 to 2018, the big drivers will be reduction of integration and restructuring cost that we had this year, about $10-ish million of working capital dollar improvement, while we continue to improve our days, and does get offset by some increase in CapEx. So that's kind of the bridge between 2017 and 2018. And going from net income to that, I mean it's depreciation, and basically offsetting some of the non-cash pension income and some improvement in working capital and the D&A. So, it's pretty standard stuff. So, longer-term, it's the same, the drivers of getting to $1 billion (25:02) have not changed. As we look from where we end fiscal 2018 and going to $1 billion, it will be driving working capital improvements, and continuous improvement in capital efficiency. I think Bill has mentioned before, I think in the last four years, five years that we've done a great job of reducing our CapEx. And as we've taken 2 million square feet of our floor space, out of our consolidated business between Harris and Exelis, that continues to drive a lower CapEx. And then growth in top line will drive earnings growth. So, those are the big pieces of getting to a $1 billion. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I mean, let me just add here, I think I'm very, very pleased with our cash performance in fiscal 2017. As Rahul said, we came down by about six days versus what we expected was three, which is extraordinary performance, and we feel good about it. A little snapback in next year, but not a lot. We do see a little bit more opportunity in working capital performance, 43 days is pretty good, maybe a little bit more over time, but getting beyond where we're at in 2018 is going to hinge a lot on earnings growth, net income growth and that's what we expect to see that bridge from 2018 guidance to $1 billion a couple of years out. So, thank you, Jason. Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. Bill, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the Army review that you referenced in your introductory remarks and sort of what's prompted it, what do you guys think the Army is kind of looking for here, what are some of the things they might come back and ask for, what in their view is some of the shortfalls for Communication Systems at this point and to what extent is WIN-T a pacing item for HMS and other things that you're involved with, if it is at all? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah Seth, thanks for that question. Look, OSD CAPE commissioned a study that's been led by this firm called IDA, the Institute for Defense Analyses of the Army communications network and it was something that was required in the 2016 NDAA. And they did a lot of work, they came out and talked to a few different companies, not a lot of time with us, but they scoured the commercial landscape a little bit in the defense base. They came up with the report. It was issued in the spring. The chief then out-briefed that to industry and other players. In that out-brief, he expressed in terms of concerned what he really needs to see is a network to your question, he's looking for, as you would expect, assured communication, assured connectivity, so it has to be secure, it has to be simple and intuitive, able to be operated, implemented, maintained by soldiers in the battlefield, resilient, maneuverable and I think an important element he wanted to make sure it's upgradable, so that he is not hardware constrained. And that's where I think there's a great opportunity for us at Harris because through a commercial model, we invest our own money, we develop the radios on our own nickel, we build headroom into our radio platforms which allows those radios because they are software defined to be upgraded over time to do applications, new waveform, new waveform technologies and that's where we see an opportunity here. What they've decided to do is, is split their analysis into three pieces, sort of the upper tactical tier, the lower tactical tier which is the radios, the manpack, the handheld, and an application. And I think because you'll see two things, one is the budget is growing in 2018, which the Army is supportive of and then importantly the delivery order that came out yesterday, which is encouraging them to move forward on manpack testing early next year, I think there are encouraging signs that the Army sees they can separate the upper and lower tactical tier, they have to connect over time, but they could be separated and we can move forward in the lower tactical tier as they evaluate what they want to do with the upper system, which is effectively WIN-T. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Good morning guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, Bill, I wanted to ask about U.S. foreign military financing, just because it's been in the headlines in the past about the potential for cuts, can you give us a sense of how much of your international radio levels are FMS funded. And then maybe, what you're seeing as the trends in the 2017 budget that was approved and in the 2018 request as well? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Look, Pete, it's a good question. About 40% of our International business is funded by the U.S. government. So, 60% national funds, about 40% by the U.S. government. Frankly, we're seeing very good trends in U.S. support for our international partners. The total amount of the funding was around $7 billion or so in the 2016 budget. It grew to about $11 billion in 2017. The marks are around $13 billion in fiscal 2018, when you look at the where the President is at is where the House and Senate happen to be. The buckets are moving around a little bit. A lot of support for counter-ISIL, so it was Iraq and Syrian Train and Equip is now counter-ISIL. Afghanistan, Europe you see the ERI, the European Reassurance Initiative still support for Ukraine, South China Sea, there's a Security Cooperation Fund. So, there's lots of different buckets. But the funding trend is actually quite positive, and it's important for us because, again about 40% of our International Tactical business is funded by the U.S. government. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. That's great, very helpful. Thank you. And my only other one I had was on UK Morpheus, so I just wanted to ask you, because I thought it was a 2021 start, but it seems like you're talking about that more, have they accelerated that program? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: No, it's still sitting out there in that 2021 program, but GD was awarded a study program, it's about \u00a3330 million, if I remember the number right. Basically, where the UK MoD wants to go is developing a open architecture, non-proprietary system or the system design is owned by the MoD, GD is helping with that. There are some programs that we're starting to win associated with that for the tactical internet backbone radio. But we see this as a big opportunity for us. It will be beyond 2020. We have something like 50,000 or 60,000 Bowman radios there and we do see that to be a good opportunity. And frankly our very strong position across all of the services in the U.S. is going to help us a lot I think in the UK. So, we're very optimistic and it's going to progress probably several years out. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Pete. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: So, I remember last quarter I think you talked about some expiring funds as of 09/30 and I was wondering if you could update us on that and give us some flavor for what ex-Australia, the RF tactical book-to-bill likely sits in the September quarter? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, that's a very specific question, not just the year, but looking at just the next quarter. Look there is some expiring fund, Gautam, and our team up in Rochester is really all over that as you know them well and expect them to be and we expect them to be. And because we could move very, very quickly and a lot of our products are required in some of the markets like Ukraine, where there are some funds that are expiring, we're pushing very hard for that, we're hopeful that we can pull some of that into Q1 here. Beyond that, I won't comment on book-to-bill for the quarter for that tactical business, but I would say for the year, for fiscal 2018, we should all expect that book-to-bill to be reasonably above 1, just given the fact that that very sizeable Australian order shifted into fiscal 2018 and should help us in the full year, driving the book-to-bill over 1 in that business. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Could you quantify what level of funds are in fact expiring by the government fiscal yearend? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I think that's probably findable, I think it's little north of $100 million in that range, which of course, we're going to go for part of that. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Sure. Okay. And then on Australia, so assuming you book it this quarter, how quickly do you start to ship on it and could you remind us again of the profile of it, I remember the radios, we're sort of at the backend and some of the systems integrations at the frontend, if you could just give us some flavor on how much revenue from Australia is booked into the current fiscal year and how much you expect to get in subsequent years? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Sure. Look, we are confident it's going to come here in the first quarter. I think, as Rahul pointed out, the Investment Committee approval was very substantial, getting a letter of intent following that was very important. Getting an advanced order, if you will, for some risk reduction activities in Q4, again was very encouraging for us. It only has to go through the National Security Council which is scheduled at the end of August. So, we're feeling pretty good that it's going to come in that range that Rahul mentioned, around $260 million. As we said last time, it's about a three-year program. It's going to roll into 2018. It'll ramp a little bit more in 2019 and 2020. This year, we think it's going to be about $60 million more or less of revenue and then the balance in the out years. And yeah, the radio is a little bit further in the backend, but overall margins I think will be reasonably good for that particular program and won't dilute the overall segment margins given where our guidance happens to be in fiscal 2018. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: And the only other thing, Gautam, I would say is that given the order that we got in fourth quarter allowed us to keep the program on track with some of the development, risk reduction, and other work, so that way the slight delay in order did not impact the revenue profile, so that was important. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then given the pipeline metrics in prior quarters, I was wondering if you could update us DoD versus International? And then also what your current thinking is for timing of the manpack orders? It's still the spring of next year, and therefore not much in the way of revenue is assumed from the HMS Manpack program in the current fiscal year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, Gautam, look on the DoD side, the pipeline is about $1.5 billion. So, it's up a little bit from last time and up pretty substantially from the beginning of the year as we start to see more of the modernization opportunities come into the pipeline. So, it's about a $1.5 billion, the International is around $2.5 billion. The shape is, it is not changing a whole lot, a lot of it is Middle East, but that's not changing a lot. And it's pretty much in line with where we were last quarter around $2.4 billion. So, again very healthy and continued healthy pipeline associated with the tactical business. Now in the manpack, like I said, I'm encouraged about this delivery order that we got yesterday. It ships in the early part of next year. I think the data is sometime early in April. They will do a field base risk reduction effort, and that will be in the April, May, June timeframe. We'll get some guidance in the coming weeks on the RFP time range. I think it's probably still in that March, April, May timeframe. If there's revenue in the manpack, it will be very late in fiscal 2018. It could shift into fiscal 2019. But right now, we still see at least some coming at the back end of the year, certainly some revenue associated with this delivery order. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: You bet, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Noah. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Bill, so what's down in International next year, because you just quantified Australia as a not insignificant chunk of revenue relative to the size of International Tactical comm, and then sounds like no let up in Europe, sounds like you're saying Middle East is recovering and I think that's off a fairly low base. So, what's going against it that keeps that flat in 2018? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Look, I think we're coming off of a better year in fiscal 2017 than we thought. I'm very, very pleased with where we've come up. Europe has been the star of the year. We had hit record levels and far above what we thought it would be. CALA was very, very good, and we saw Canada being very strong in fiscal 2017. So, as we go into 2018, yes, we do see good growth in the Middle East, both Saudi because of the (38:10) order that we booked in our Q4 for the SINCGARS product line has been sitting out there for several years; it's finally been booked. We sized that before in this call at around $40 million. That's going to roll into next year. We see Iraq starting to come back a little bit, and we're seeing a lot of strength in the Africa region both in Northern Africa, as well as sub-Saharan. So the whole Middle East, Africa region is going to recover into next year. I think that's a good sign. Now Asia-Pacific is coming up largely because of Australia, but a few other countries are also important contributors in fiscal 2018 in Asia. Central Asia which has been relatively weak, largely Afghanistan, Pakistan will be about flat. But as we look out in the future, the offsetting piece is going to be Europe, and it's going to be in the Central American, Latin American region. Europe, I think will remain strong, but it's not going to be at that record level that we saw in 2017, so we do see that coming back off a little bit in 2018. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So, just some tough comparisons there. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It's going to be tough comparisons in Europe. Same thing as well as in the CALA region, and again like I said, we had a really good year with some quick term funding in Canada, and that's going to come back off a little bit. So those are the three markets that will offset what I think is good trajectory in the other regions. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. When you were speaking to the medium-term growth framework by segment, and definitely appreciate you providing that color, because I think the investor base is looking further out here than your average company. When you said accelerating mid-single-digit in Communication Systems, that sounded conservative to me, but then you said upper-single in Electronics, so it sounds like that's really what you see in CS. I guess, could we dig a little further into that, because in my model, if I just assume the old base business grows 5%, International grows 5%, Public Safety grows 5%, just kind of mid single-digit for those items. With how I have the ramp laid out for the new programs, you've mentioned you've swept. And obviously the ramp on those can look \u2013 there's a wide range of outcomes for that ramp, but just there's so much new revenue flowing in that it's hard for the total business to not be well through that 5%, which is also at the high end of the range of what you have this year with some headwinds. So what's going against that description I just laid out because that gets easily into the double-digits. What am I missing? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I think you laid out a very good picture on the DoD side, in tactical, I do see that part growing very fast. It's going to come off a fairly low base, and there's very good support of modernization and that could cause that part of the business to grow very quickly. Again, keep in mind, it's coming off, if you look in the back up in the page around $390 million, $400 million of revenue. So it's not a big piece to start, so very significant double-digit growth which we do expect in that business beyond 2018 is \u2013 it won't be the biggest driver. You mentioned, Public Safety, mid-single digit 5%, I think it's going to be lighter than that. Night Vision could be a little bit lighter than that. The biggest part of the segment is International... Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: ...and a lot of that segment going to grow mid-single digits or high-single digits is going to hinge on whether all of the cylinders are firing across all regions on international. And, right now, we see next year flat to down modestly, but then growing beyond that, again, because of Australia, UK, Middle East, but again depends on whether all the pieces come at the same time, Noah. And let me just comment on the (41:51) because you mentioned that. I'm really pleased with our bid activity, our pipeline activity, the wins we're seeing there, and it's really across the board. So we're feeling very good about that. So mid-to-high single-digits to me is very, very achievable in that segment, and it's coming off a very high margin as well. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: What's assumed for Army manpack in that statement of accelerating mid-single digits for CS? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it follows what's happening in the funding trajectory. We do see growth in fiscal 2018. It's going to probably come at the backend. It depends on when the RFP happens and when deliveries actually occur, but it's going to follow the budget picture which is growing quite substantially. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. Thanks a lot. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Noah. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Your line is open. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you very much. First, could you address, Bill, a little bit this ADS-B headwind. I mean, it's a substantial number, and what does sustainment mean versus just build out of the network? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I'll ask Rahul to just comment on that. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah. So, Howard, ADS-B, I mean I think this contract goes back to 2007, 2008, when Exelis started it. The first phase ended, which was kind of the build out phase, ended in September 2016. So, it ended kind of Q1 of our last fiscal year. Then, we got some extension and one-time award and all that for settlement. So, realistically speaking, it kind of ended Q2 last year. So, we started seeing the ramp down on margins, and it's a fairly \u2013 because it was build out, going to more sustainment, there're still very, very healthy margins, but it's not at that level that we've been getting. So that's \u2013 we've kind of been talking about it. We spoke about it in the Q3 call as well as we were seeing that come down. So it creates whatever $0.22 of headwinds on EPS for us and to be largely be in the first half and then the margins stabilize and kind of stay at that level for going back next four years. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right, final. I mean, can you just put a kind of general size of revenues on this. I thought it was a couple of hundred million dollars, is that right, of what it used to be? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: It'll be slightly north of $100 million in fiscal 2018. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: And it was just under, at a high, like $160 million, $180 million in that range in the 2016, 2017 fiscal years. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Just two more questions. One is if \u2013 you've had this manpack slip and while you have some positive wins on some of the other radio programs, the Army is not going to stop taking radios in the intermediate term. So, what are you going to end up or what are you going to end up being able to bid for or sell with this push out in the modernization program? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well look, it's not just Army, we sell radios throughout the services and I wouldn't discount the significant wins that we have with SOCOM taking on a hand-held side, which will start to deliver the back half of the year. And if you look back a couple of quarters ago, we launched a new HF radio, and Harris is positioned in HF globally, it's very, very strong. And we launched our radio with 10x data rate. It's just fantastic and it's picking up a lot of traction. And I think that's going to pick up some traction particularly in SATCOM-denied, SATCOM-issue, SATCOM-concerns and I think that's going to get some traction in the Army next year as well. So we see that. We also see opportunities to sell more 117Gs is into the Army for just improving readiness. So we see a number of different opportunities in the Army, but again I think the manpack is still sitting at the backend of our fiscal 2018 network. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : I mean, Bill, maybe what I'm trying to say is that, they are not going to buy nothing for a period of time while this testing continues to go on because the Army is marching in a lot of different places and using systems. So even though this is split to the right, there's ongoing just operational needs which will be filled in with some of your core products. Is that a fair conclusion? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: That's very fair. That's exactly what we're seeing. We don't know exactly when that will be or the shape of that but we do believe they're going to continue to buy, and I think it, as I mentioned, some of our 117Gs, it could be the new HF radio. It could be a variety of different things. So you're exactly right, Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : Thank you, Bill. And then, finally not to ignore Space for a moment, I think you said a number of new items or a number of new things there, and if you could just elaborate a little bit. First, it would seem as if you won some additional sensors on some new commercial satellites for inventory, if that's correct? And then second, could you elaborate a little bit on what you're doing in terms of building a new satellite? I think you said, and then maybe talk about some of the new architecture applications? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Sure. We've talked about that on this call several times where the Intel community is moving towards more disaggregated capabilities which could be hosted payloads on various satellites or it could be small satellites and we're a significant player on both of them, the expertise that we've developed and demonstrated through the hosted payloads which are now flying on Iridium NEXT is proving our presence in some ways on HPL, on hosted payloads. Within a couple of years, we'll have more than 200 payloads flying, which is probably the market-leading position. And we won a couple of important contracts to develop, design small sats for the community. And we're going to fly our own small sat to reduce risk so it demonstrates our ability to have a mission that is our own entire soup to nuts satellite. So we're going in that direction. This I think is very positive for us and it shows our agility, our nimbleness, our willingness to spend R&D dollars to commercialize that technology. On the commercial side, and you referenced that briefly, we actually had a very good year in fiscal 2017 on commercial reflectors. We won about five awards. We were winning sort of two a year in years before that and we've got a great pipeline coming up. So we do see continued growth in the commercial reflector side within Space and Intel as well. So I don't know, if I answered your question, I think that those were the two pieces you're asking about Howard. Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC : No, this is great, Bill. Thank you very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. You bet. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Josh Sullivan of Seaport Global. Your line is open. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Josh. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Can you just provide some color on that U.S. Army LMR network upgrade I believe for Public Safety. Does that help change kind of the growth profile for the segment? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I don't think it's going to be a huge driver, it's a big IDIQ, our competitor won the same sort of IDIQ. We both got a $10 million initial award. It is sized on the order of sort of $20 million to $40 million. At least it's been running at about $20 million to $40 million a year. I think the big difference here is that we've not been able to participate in those awards because we weren't on the contract vehicle. It was effectively sole-sourced. So it opens up a market opportunity for us. We have lot of relationships intimacy with our omni-customer and I do think that we have a good ability to compete there, again sizing it. It has been running at $20 million to $40 million in that range. Could it ramp faster than that? It's possible. But that's how I would think about that one, Josh. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just on the growth profile for Space and Intel next year. Can you just expand on the program transitions on the civil side, I think with some environmental programs, anyway to scope or timeline that for us? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Sure. The classified business is actually going pretty well. It's about two-thirds of that segment and we're tracking at or slightly better than where the classified budgets are going. We had some indications of where they're at beyond 2018 and they see within some of the specific areas. And I think it actually supports our business and our business model pretty well. So we could see it continue in next year and beyond growth in the classified side. The commercial reflector business, which isn't that big sort of in the $50 million, $60 million range, but we see that business growing a little bit. The piece that is down next year and it's down double-digits, is on the environmental side, environmental solutions or weather, and part of it is the transition from GOES-R or GOES-16 program, which we had from Exelis, both the AVI sensor onboard as well as all the ground processing that legacy Harris was doing. So, that was a reasonably good-sized program that will be down double-digits going into fiscal 2018. We also see in the budget outlook some additional pressure on some of the NOAA/NASA program supporting global weather as we see a little bit of pressure there. But beyond 2018, we see that leveling out a little bit and we see that business stabilizing going beyond 2018 and the 2019 and beyond. And we do still see some good international opportunities on the weather side, both with international partners as well as with the defense base, because the Air Force has to upgrade its weather capabilities in places like over CENTCOM, and we think we have an opportunity to help them with that. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay, good. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Your line is open. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Rahul, a quick question for you on the cash flow, in fact the free cash flow deployment. I think I've got it right to say you expect to spend another $600 million on debt pay down and $150 million on share repurchase. So, assuming you get to your free cash flow guidance, what will the rest of the cash be allocated on? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: There will be dividends. So, we expect to generate between $850 million and $900 million. We typically keep kind of $300 million of cash. We ended the year with $484 million. So, we've got about $200 million extra as we start the year and we will deploy that about $600 million for debt, $150 million for stock buyback and about $270 million-ish for dividends. So, that's the layout. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, Bill, one for you. On the medium-term guidance, is this assuming that operating margins stay roughly stable versus fiscal 2018? And what are your thoughts on what free cash flow conversion would do during this period? Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. We expect our operating margin to stay at this very high level. We're sort of running in the 90%, 90.5% range, which is very, very strong, strong in the segment and we feel great about it. We expect operational savings to offset any pressure on inflation like on wages or new program starts and we'll hold that very substantial high-teens margins into the out years, which means very good drop through into operating margin growth \u2013 operating profit growth, which as we continue to grow our cash flow, we'll see cash conversion consistently above our net income simply because of our ability to drive cash growth in our high depreciation amortization that's in our net income. So we continue to see over 100% of free cash to net income. And when you look out beyond 2018 and things that just Rahul just talked about, we don't see any incremental debt pay down required beyond 2018, which means we have a lots of opportunities to deploy that free cash either with share buyback or to M&A, which will be an accelerator on earnings per share growth beyond fiscal 2018 and that's how we see that playing itself out. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great. Thanks so much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you all for joining us and participating in today's conference call. If there are any further questions, please feel free to get in touch with me. Thank you. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

And welcome to the Harris Corporation\u2019s First Quarter 2018 Fiscal Year Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Sonia. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris\u2019 SEC filings. In addition, discussions today will include non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning we posted Q1 fiscal \u201818 results and we are off to a good start to the year. Earnings per share was up 8% to $1.38 on flat revenue, margins expanded 70 basis points to 19.2%, free cash improved by $50 million and we returned $144 million to shareholders through share repurchases and increase dividend, our 16th consecutive annual increase. The highlight of the quarter was orders increasing 33% to a record $2.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.6. So let me highlight a few of these key wins across the three segments indicated on slide four, starting with Communication Systems. We finally secured the much anticipated $260 million order for Australia\u2019s Phase 3 modernization, the first stage of a multiyear program with total potential value of over $1 billion. As you know, the Australian MoD has standardized on Harris networking technology and to-date we have shipped about $800 million in radios and we are leveraging that incumbency into developing and building a broader integrated network. This is part of an important strategy initiative to expand our addressable market and we are replicating in other geographies. In Eastern Europe we received a further $52 million in order from Ukraine as part of the Ukraine security assistance initiative to modernize communications to meet emerging threats in the region, building on very strong orders performance last year. In the Middle East and Africa, we anticipate a recovery in \u201818 and then in the quarter orders were more than doubled the prior year with a $39 million order from Iraq and $46 million from Kenya. Overall, international tactical book-to-bill was well over 2 and was still greater than 1 excluding Australia. In DoD we also saw increased demand with orders growing about 40% including more than $100 million focused on readiness. A couple of notable awards include $36 million from the Air Force for upgrades of their legacy communications equipment to software defined radios to support multi mission operations and $38 million from the Marine Corps for radios with MUOS capability to enable high quality satellite communication on expeditionary missions. On omni modernization as I mentioned on the last earnings call we received an order for $101 HMS manpack test radios from the Army at the beginning of Q1 and we expect to start deliveries later this quarter. With the down selected two vendors now accomplished, we are working with the Army as a prepared for field-based risk reduction in the spring of 2018. DoD tactical book-to-bill was also well above 1 in the quarter and overall tactical communications backlog is now $879 million, up 66% from the prior year and 78% sequentially. Excluding Australia, backlog is up 25% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. Public Safety and Night Vision also had strong order resulting in Communication Systems having record orders of about $825 million and book-to-bill of 2. Following the close of the quarter, we received $765 million sole-sourced IDIQ award from the Navy for Falcon III and next-generation radios, replacing a contract that was completely exhausted in April. This value was more than double the previous contract and aligned with the Navy\u2019s budget request to ramp up Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years. In Electronic Systems, we continue to see strength in our electronic warfare business and received a $133 million contract for U.S. Navy and Australian F-18s, continuing a 20 year relationship and enabling legacy platforms to perform more advanced missions. We also provide the EW system for international F-16s and in the quarter we received $47 million in additional funding from Morocco to complete the upgrade of their entire fleet. We have several additional international opportunities in the pipeline. In the Avionics business, we continue to ramp production for the F-35, with a $63 million order for LRIP 10 release systems. In addition, we expanded our international footprint with key wins in Singapore and Turkey for smart carriage and release systems on international F-16s. These smart racks can carry two payloads of up to \u00a31,000 each and have a innovative and patent electronics enabling direct communication between the aircraft and the payload. In C4ISR, we leverage our classified robotics expertise and were awarded a contract worth up to \u00a355 million from the U.K. Ministry of Defense to provide robotic systems to support explosive ordnance disposal missions. The U.K. MoD is a global leader in EOD and our state-of-the-art product delivers real-time haptic feedback and unparalleled range of precision control. We are excited about offering -- about our offering and expect other countries to follow the U.K.\u2019s lead as they upgrade EOD capabilities. Overall, Electronic Systems book-to-bill was 1.5, with both electronic warfare and avionics above 2. And finally, in Space and Intel, we had a number of significant wins driving a segment book-to-bill of 1.4, with continued strength in a Classified domain and in a commercial reflector business. Let me provide a little color where I can on a couple of them. On our Q2 call last year, I noted a new franchise emerging from an $80 million Classified contract that we described in as a group -- as a ground-based adjacency. We knew this program had the potential to grow into several $100 million and after a successful startup, we were awarded a $35 million -- $34 million follow-on contract in the first quarter, further solidifying our position in this new franchise area. In addition, I noted last quarter that investing in R&D and innovating ahead of customer need enable us to win two Classified small sat programs. These pathfinder missions have proven successful as our customers move towards disaggregated, more affordable and responsive space solutions, and we received an award this quarter that has a potential to grow to more than $100 million over the next two years. And then finally in our Commercial Space business, we received our largest order for a single commercial satellite covering four reflectors, bringing total orders to eight over the past two years. Our commercial reflector pipeline remains robust and we expect these recapitalization and expansion trends to continue through fiscal \u201818. So, overall, we are seeing positive momentum across the company and I\u2019m pleased with our strong orders growth driven by sustained our -- internal R&D investments over the past several years. This strong start to the year gives us confidence in our full year guidance and reinforces our view that we are at the beginning of a multiyear growth inflection. Let me now turn the call over Rahul for details on the financial. Rahul? Rahul Ghai : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Just a quick reminder that fiscal \u201818 results are compared with the prior year non-GAAP figures, which excluded acquisition-related costs. Total company results on slide five. Revenue was about flat, with growth in Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence offset by lower revenue in Communication Systems. Operating income was up 3% and EPS was up 8%. Free cash flow grew by $50 million to $72 million. Turning now to first quarter EPS bridge on slide six. EPS grew by $0.10. The expected $0.08 headwind from the ADS-B transition was partially offset the disciplined capital deployment in fiscal \u201817. Strong segment performance delivered $0.12 of accretion from solid program execution, incremental integration savings, higher pension income and lower costs. Benefit of higher volume in Avionics, Battle Management Systems and Classified Space was offset by lower Environmental and Communication Systems volume. Segment detail on slide seven, Communication Systems revenue was $410 million, down 5%. Tactical Communication revenue was down 5%, with DoD down 2% from lower airborne radios volume. International tactical revenue was down 6%, as substantial growth in the Middle East primarily from Iraq was offset by the expected declines in central Asia and in Central and Latin America due to a tough year-over-year compare, and though, slightly down Europe remained strong driven by Eastern Europe. Public Safety and Night Vision were both down mid-single digits. Segment operating income was flat at $118 million, but margin expanded 140 basis points to 28.8%, as lower cost and operational efficiencies more than offset the impact from lower volume. Historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog is provided in the supplementary material. Moving to slide eight, Electronic Systems revenue was $540 million, up 1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of ADS-B program transition, revenue was up 5%. This was driven by the ramp in UAE Battle Management Systems program and growth in Avionics across several platforms, such as F-35, F-22 and F-18. Segment operating income was down slightly to $109 million and margin was down 50 basis points to 20.2%, as solid performance across the segment and ongoing focus on operational excellence offset a $14 million headwind from the ADS-B program transition. Slide nine, System and Intelligence revenue was $466 million, up 3%, Classified business was up 8% and Environmental revenue decline double digits, in line with expectations as some programs trended down. Segment operating income was up 10% to $87 million and margin expanded 130 basis points to 18.7%, driven by strong program performance and higher pension income. Moving to slides 10 and 11 for full year guidance, guidance for fiscal \u201818 remains unchanged, with EPS in a range of $5.85 to $6.05, up 6% to 9%, including benefit from $150 million of share repurchases for the year, with $75 million completed in the first quarter. Total company revenue guidance is unchanged in a range of $6.02 billion to $6.14 billion, up 2% to 4%. Communication Systems is expected to grow 3% to 5% with DoD tactical up double digits, from increased focus on readiness and incremental modernization volume. International tactical is still expected to be flat to down slightly with growth in the back half of the year as the Australia modernization program ramps up. Electronic Systems is expected to be up 3% to 5% with growth in avionics, electronic warfare and battle management systems. Space and Intelligence is expected to be flat to up 1% as strong revenue growth in the Classified area will be partially offset by the headwind from the Environmental programs. Total company operating margin guidance remains unchanged in a range of 19% to 19.5%. We also continue to expect $850 million to $900 million in free cash flow for the full year. The first quarter tax rate of 27.7% benefited from the stock-based compensation accounting standard that we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal \u201817. We still expect a full year tax rate of about 28.5%. The remaining three quarters are expected to average 28.8% within quarter-to-quarter depending on specific tax timing differences. And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Pete Skibitski : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Bill Brown : Hey. Good morning, Pete. Pete Skibitski : Hey. Bill is revenue kind of line with your expectations or it was a little bit light or it was just timing or maybe CR -- related? Bill Brown : Yeah. It -- look, I think, we are pretty pleased with where we happen to be in the first quarter coming at about flat. I am very, very happy with where we were on orders. Orders were very, very strong and as look at the balance of the year we have got fair amount of the backend of the year is now covered in backlog or in firm or follow-on high probability follow-on orders. So it\u2019s actually quite good. When I look just across the businesses, CS came in a down 5%, so we saw a couple of opportunity shift in the Q2, but we see though the balance of year being very, very strong. Electronic Systems came in at 1%, but when you exclude the impact of ADS-B it would be up 5%. So that\u2019s a pretty substantial drag in the quarter and we will see that again in Q2. And then Space coming in at 3% for the first quarter is above the full year guidance and again reflects some good trends that are happening at business. So, overall, I think, we are pretty pleased with where we happen to be in the first quarter. Pete Skibitski : Okay. Fair enough. And then just last one Bill for you, I was wondering if you can make some comments on some of the consolidation we have seen in the Space. UTX buying Collins, North buying OA, obviously, is going to have some impact on the Communications market, small satellite that kind of stuff. And so I am just wondering how you see it as it put in a competitive advantage or disadvantage rather as some of these big guys get bigger or you feel like maybe just more nimble and then can maybe move faster than those guys, just curious on your comments? Bill Brown : Yeah. Pete, look, I think, from my perspective at Harris, we don\u2019t see any change to our game plan. We have a healthy amount of respect for the competitors we have in the space and the moves that they are making. But we feel we have got good skill position in the franchise areas, we haven\u2019t been participating in. We spent the number of years investing in our franchise and focusing our businesses where we know we could be successful and winning based on technology, so while we -- we feel pretty good. We watch what\u2019s happening in the industry. But we feel good about the position of Harris Corporation and where the budget happens to be going and I think the future is a very bright for Harris. Pete Skibitski : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Seth Seifman : Hey. Good morning. Thanks very much. Bill Brown : Hey, Seth. Seth Seifman : Bill, we had a lot of development in the tactical Comms area over the last couple months. I wonder if you could address just broadly kind of two of them, one being how you think the changes in start of the upper end of tactical and having to do with WIN-T and what that sort of means for Harris over time? And secondly, or the comments that the Army has made recently basically suggest that they are looking to incorporate more capability into their Communication capabilities faster and how you think that Harris can address these capabilities and whether you see the Army kind of looking at all to new entrants to try and deliver any of this capability and if there are any new entrants who can? Bill Brown : It was I think very, very good questions. I think you\u2019re referencing a lot of the discussions gone over the last six months to eight months, maybe little bit longer than that led by the Chief on the future of the Army architecture, the resiliency, the concerns about maneuverability and variety of other things. They commissioned a study. The study came out with the findings. The Army has elaborated on that over the summer. That engage industry and lots of ways and conversations around that and it was some recent testimony in September in front of what is subcommittees of the House of Services Committee talking about some directions the Army wants to move in. First of all in the upper tactical system mainly relates to WIN-T. We are provider of some components on WIN-T. We provide the high-band networking radio, as well as an H&W waveform which we\u2019ve develop. Frankly, as I look for ways of making that that system more resilient, more maneuverable, that could slow down some opportunities to Harris to upgrade its H&W waveform and each in our radio, which we are proceeding with today. In terms of the Army wanting to put more capabilities into the tactical radio with the tactical Internet faster. Frankly, works directly in our favor in many ways and I think is a strong footstep on the commercial model that Harris has been known for. The ability to quickly embed commercial technologies, continuously innovate, developing new capabilities, fielding them very quickly, investing ahead of the curve and building headroom on our radios, so that you can onboard new waveforms, new technologies based on where the market is moving or threats are changing. So that works very much in favor of the model that Harris I think it\u2019s been known for is very, very strong at. So, I think, overall, I think, this is a -- this will eventually be a good outcome for the company. There\u2019s been some deliberation over last six months, but I think, it started to come, become clear as to where the Army wants to move. They clearly have made a strong statement in support of the manpack radio. They made a strong statement in support of the two channel leader radio. They want to become more SOCOM like, which shall again goes back in support of Harris. I think, overall, this could shake out to be good news over time for Harris. Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks. Thanks very much. Bill Brown : You bet sir. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks. Couple questions, first, I am wondering, could you give us the legacy RF tactical orders and sales in the just so we have? Rahul Ghai : So we have not tracking, as we\u2019ve mentioned, I think, on the last call, we are not going to track it that, we just going to provide now combined results for the tactical radio business between Harris and Exelis. As we have combined and integrated the business, operationally we\u2019re running it as one. Our sales forces are now combined. So we have -- even internal we are just soft tracking between Exelis and Harris and just tracking it as -- just as the tactical radio business and we have the details in the supplementary material for the overall business. Bill Brown : Yeah. I don\u2019t think the adding an Exelis really changes a trend very much, frankly. Gautam Khanna : All right. Couple of things, one, I was wondering if you could give us your -- the guidance then change on a net basis, but are there any puts and takes within that like Australia you are expecting $60 million of sales this year, is that still the expectation and any comment on kind of permit the actual net numbers, there has been any changes of consequence? Bill Brown : Yeah. I think, we -- again, you are about right on Australia that should be about the flow-through in the year. Overall, we still see good growth on DoD, up double-digit for the year and international, as Rahul said in his prepared remarks, flat to down slightly. We still see a very strong pipeline. It\u2019s about $2.3 billion. We see the Middle East and Africa region, perhaps, being a bit incrementally better in the year than we thought just a couple of months ago. It\u2019s going to be up significantly double-digit and little bit better than we have thought. And again we are seeing good opportunities flow-through in Iraq. We are seeing that almost doubling over the course of the year. The U.S. government support, there is actually quite strong. We know Saudi is going to come up off a very low base from last year, mainly because of the [ph] reef product (23:04) or SINCGARS product that\u2019s going to flow-through this year. North Africa looks good. We see Kenya looking pretty good. The UAE is pretty strong. The only place is really soft in the Middle East would be in Jordan, but again, overall, Middle East is a little bit better. Asia-Pacific just a little bit better as well than last time, again, up significantly double digits. Australia is a key part of it. There is a couple of other markets in Southeast Asia that are quite strong. So APAC a little bit better. Maybe Europe is about the same, maybe a little bit worse over the course of the last couple of months. We had a good start. We booked in Ukraine was a big deal for us. But Romania is going to be some pressure in the year. Poland is going to be some year-over-year pressure in the year and in Cal -- in Central Asia, both look a little bit weak and we knew they will be weak, but probably, incrementally, but weaker than we thought before. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And Bill, following up on Pete\u2019s question about consolidation and you guys has been buying a lot of stock. I am curious what is the M&A pipeline looking like for you guys as an acquire and now that the balance sheet a lot better shape and the Exelis integration is effectively completed. Bill Brown : Yeah. Gautam Khanna : Are you looking at stuff and it\u2019s still kind of -- what types of property interest you in terms of size capability, any color you can give? Bill Brown : I really can\u2019t give you much color. We -- you are right. We have completed Exelis integration. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We\u2019ve got a little more debt to pay down at the end of this year about another $550 million in fiscal \u201818. We\u2019ve -- I think we\u2019ve proven our credit if you will on how we bought a company at a good part of the cycle. We are discipline in what we paid and integrated very, very well. So the team is looking at a variety of different opportunities none of which are must haves that could help us accelerate in some of our key franchise areas. But I don\u2019t believe today that we need to acquire to be successful. We are going to be opportunistic. We will be very focused on where we buy. But we are just starting to look a little more. But, again, it won\u2019t be an area that\u2019s outside of our core Space. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Thanks for that guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Carter Copeland : Hey. Good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Good morning, Carter. Welcome back. Carter Copeland : Hi. Thanks. Good to be back. Couple questions for you, one, Bill, I just want to ask, Seth\u2019s question another way, just to get at the kind of risk here. As you think about the deliberations that the customers has had here, are there factored bookings, I would say in your plan, at the latter part of this year that has some sort of risk, if the customer moves slower than expected in terms of deciding what the network architectures supposed to look like holistically. Just trying to get a sense of whether there is incremental risk here to the inflection that you\u2019ve talked about in growth? Bill Brown : We think the armies, first of all, across the DoD, they are moving money into some of the current accounts. We see readiness picking up. This is a bit more aggressively than we thought just a couple of months ago. There is a lot of conversation about equipping new security forces and that is going to we believe help us in the year. The -- we have very little in the year on monetization. It\u2019s up from last year. We had a good start to the year on selling the MUOS waveform. We expect this year to be about $50 million and 80% of that are so was booked in Q1. So that\u2019s pretty strong. But we\u2019ve sort of derisk what we expect to see coming out of the Army manpack. It is largely just a test radios that we have shipped. We do see the SOCOM handheld radio beginning to ship in the back half of the year. That\u2019s going to ramp into \u201819. But as I sit here today and based on as I look at our backlog and backlog roll off in the tactical business largely, we probably have about 50% or just about 50% of the back into Q2 through Q4 revenue that\u2019s now in backlog and will flow out. So we feel better today looking at the backend of the year, Carter, than we did last year at this point in time. So what I think we are relatively well calibrated in the year. Carter Copeland : Great. That\u2019s great color. And then, Rahul, just two quick ones, with respect to the margin strength in ES and Space and Intel, were there any net favorable EAC adjustments to note in those? And then the second one is, given the potential for tax reform, how you guys thinking about potentially prefunding lot of pension? Thanks. Rahul Ghai : Yeah. Good question, Carter. So on EAC adjustments, overall, it\u2019s kind of similar to where we were last year same time, so really no difference. I think both Space and ES had good operational performance and kind of Space had little bit of award fee timing that -- those things fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and ES had some a slight favorable fixed price content mix and some close out on fixed price programs. So those things helped in the quarter but overall we feel good about where they had margins happen to be. And on the -- on your second question on the pension, we contributed $400 million last year, so we had about 80% funded. So that\u2019s -- so we have to be -- which is -- which we feel relatively good about. And the second part is, so given that we are -- we will keep and as interest rates move by about 25 basis points our pension deficit cuts down by like $160 million. So point of interest rate movement is going to cut our pension deficit by half. So we are going to continue to monitor that and think about what that means on when we made pension contribution if we chose to do so. We have -- given our fiscal year ending, we have little bit more time than others do in terms of, if we have to do something extra on pension. But right now we feel good about where we are in terms of funding. Bill Brown : And I think on -- I think you might have mentioned about tax, well, Carter, I think, we are hopeful that tax reform does occur. I think every one point on effective tax rate worth about $0.08 for us. So that I think if that moves forward, I think, it will be a positive for Harris. Carter Copeland : That\u2019s great. Thanks, guys. Rahul Ghai : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question come from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Bill Brown : Hey, Rob. Rob Spingarn : Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning. Rahul Ghai : Good morning. Rob Spingarn : Good morning. So Rahul I have a couple of clarification questions I wanted to ask you. The first one being in the Space and Intelligence business, what is the Classified growth and the guidance if you remove the headwind? Rahul Ghai : So our Classified growth is about roughly mid-single digits around 5% year-over-year in our Space guidance. Rob Spingarn : Okay. And then, just in the cash flow you had, I think, it was a source of around $107 million in other cash from ops. I can\u2019t recall if you describe what that was already, in just wanted to follow up on that? And then, Bill, I have a radio question for you? Bill Brown : Sure. Rahul Ghai : Yeah. So on cash, listen, good start to year. We are up $50 million year-over-year in the quarter and as expected we had some working capital headwinds as we over delivered $51 in Q4. So we kind of expected that and that got offset by some refunds on tax payments we made last year and some cash tax timing differences. But on the long -- last 12-month basis we are about $900 million of free cash flow and feel good about delivering $850 million to $900 for the year. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Okay. Bill, moving back to where, Seth and Carter were going, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about JTRS, just given that we\u2019ve just have this network vulnerability study with the Army and having just visited AUSA, et cetera. One things we are hearing is that the radios, the tactical radios vulnerable examine and that there\u2019s a scaling up issue, where only a certain -- you can only get to a certain number of radios, I think, it\u2019s something like 31 before they begin to examine in the field? And so I wanted to ask you, where -- what\u2019s your comment on that, where are we technically and is there generally an issue with the hardware being able or mature enough to process the software driven radio or are we not quite there yet, is that really the core of the issue in developing this program? Bill Brown : No. Look, it\u2019s very, very complicated question that you\u2019re asking. But effectively we\u2019ve been in the business for several decades delivering radios and have been nearly standardized across the DoD on 117G 152 Alpha radios field proven. And we have develop -- we have been developing and working on the next-generation manpack radio, the single-channel rifleman radio, the two channel handheld radio, the midtier radio, we are selling them all around the world, even some of the newer product is being sold with both within and outside of the DoD. Look the technology continues to move, the threat environment continues to change and the radios have to be adaptable it over time given those current trends and what -- I think what the Army has realized is that you cannot take a JTRS program in 10 years or 11 years ago set a specification five years before the first iPhone is launched and set a specification and hope to feel it 11 years later and have it be relevant. It has to be very nimble, agile, flexible procurement process and has yet to be able to upgrade frequently. In fact that\u2019s where the Army is moving. That\u2019s where SOCOM has moved. And that\u2019s really the commercial model the Harris, I think, is distinctively good at. We develop headroom in the hardware of our radios such that when new threats come up or new waveforms that could be low probability of an interception or low probability of detection or APJ waveforms that you can onboard them into that radio in the existing hardware. It\u2019s exactly what we did by putting the MUOS waveform on to our existing 117G\u2019s. MUOS was not even contemplated on 117G. We first started fielding it eight years ago. But great waveform engineers up in Rochester were able to customize that waveform with a simple software download on drive -- drop it into 117G. That\u2019s the beauty this particular model. So to your comments and concerns, yeah, there\u2019s been a lot of question around this. The threat environment is changing, the technology is moving. What we believe that the adaptability of our model, our engineering investments in our products, we think we are going to be well-positioned no matter where the Army or fragmented in any of the other services go. So, hopefully, I\u2019m addressing your question, Rob. It\u2019s a very complicated one. But I do believe that this ultimately reflects back on the value of the commercial model that Harris is very good at. Rob Spingarn : Well, you are, Bill, and it is very complex. With all that said and I think you started to this, you answered out to Carter\u2019s question, do you have a sense of how many manpack radios you\u2019ll ship total this year and next year, is there way to quantify this and can we figure out when the annual production lot competition will begin? Bill Brown : In terms of specific number that will ship this year. Again, we were under contract on the multichannel manpack for 100 units -- 101 units and they are going to ship back into this quarter, in its early Q1 -- Q3\u2019s, early first quarter of calendar \u201818. And also want to do the field-based risk reduction, probably, in the April, May timeframe, that\u2019s sort of the current operating model. Now the down select really effectively happen us and Rockwell Collins and we are both aligned and moving the Army forwarded ready to go and I think that voice common from two competitors in the Space, I think, it\u2019s resonating with the Army. So if anything that could encourage that procurement to move faster rather than slower. So, I think, that\u2019s kind of where we see at the moment. Rob Spingarn : And your plan -- do you have a sense of when that production work would start the two of you? Bill Brown : In terms of the full rate production? Rob Spingarn : Yeah. Yeah. Bill Brown : Well, it\u2019s probably the backend of our fiscal \u201818, maybe into early fiscal \u201819. Look, I think the Army still wants to field, your right out of the gate, 60 BCT\u2019s and that could happen in two and four, could happen all six, we don\u2019t really know exactly what they are going to end up doing. But that\u2019s probably more like we have fiscal \u201819 revenue event for us as opposed to fiscal \u201818, the order could happen, in the best of cases towards the backend of fiscal \u201818. That\u2019s kind of where we see it right now. But when you look at the budget and where the Army wants to move, even the recent testimony it has in September, always in favor of moving forward at significant quantities of the HMS manpack. So, I think, it\u2019s very encouraging what we are seeing in the last couple of months. Rob Spingarn : Okay. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Your line is now open. Jason Gursky : Can you hear me okay. Bill Brown : Sure. Jason, good morning. Jason Gursky : Okay. Great. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to go back to the Space business for a moment if we can and then you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that are going on there, both on the Classified and in the Commercial side of things. On the Classified just give us a sense of where you are seeing longer term growth trends going maybe the scope of those growth trends here over the next few year? And then, on the Commercial side, DoD has been discussing moving towards a more commercial procurement model, particularly on the Communication side of things. I was wondering how Harris is going to potentially play in that and kind of what that dynamic means just in generally speaking for the satellite industry. Thanks. Bill Brown : Sure. Yeah. Let me maybe hit a couple of key points and if Rahul, do you have anything add jump in. About two-thirds of the Space business is in the Classified domain. We see the budgets up sort of single digits. We see that continuing over the next number of years as far as we can see as a visibility to it. The Classified budgets are coming up and we get a little bit of color within the topline, we can see where the money is being spent and I feel that it is growing faster in areas that Harris has developed capabilities. So our high-end exquisite sensors, as well as our pretty innovative creative small sat type solutions, and so -- I feel very good. Rahul said, for the year the Classified business will be up mid-single digits in Q1. It was up a bit stronger than that. We continue to see good solid order trends and the pipeline here is quite good. The Commercial business of the Space and Intel business which mostly commercial reflectors and GPS, that business will also be up pretty strong this year about double-digit. And again, we talked about -- some of the awards we\u2019ve seen. In that commercial reflector business we have got a strong global share. It\u2019s a commercial model driven business where we invest our own R&D to develop that offering. We sell it into the marketplace. It performed exceptionally well on orbit, almost no failures with very, very high margins. And we have been running at about two reflectors a year over the last six years and over last two years we were at about four per year. So it\u2019s kind of double and we see another five or so that were bidding opportunities in our fiscal \u201818. So we continue to see that commercial reflector business ramp. The place that we are seeing some softness in the year is really in the Environmental Solutions business. We\u2019ve talked about that over last couple of quarters, part of it is program transition where we\u2019re moving from the build of the GOES-R satellite systems, so the -- the onboard optics as well as the ground processing system is moving in a sustainment. And there we are seeing just some budgetary pressure from where the Trump Administration wants to go an environmental scientist. So we factored that into our guidance. We see the Environmental business, which more or less is about $350 million to $400 million in size being down mid-teens for the year. So we saw that in Q1. We see that over the balance of the year and beyond kind of stabilizing a little bit. So that\u2019s kind of where we sit today. The pipeline overall for that Space and Intel business is pretty robust. It\u2019s up about 4%, 5% year-over-year, $11.5 billion to $12 billion. So we continue to see good health in that Space and Intel business, and again a lot of it\u2019s from Classified and lot of it is that based on the last five year, six years of investments in IRAD that position us in some places that, frankly, where -- the -- our Classified customers are moving towards with disaggregated resilient response of solutions. So Jason that answer part of your question, let me stop there and see if there is anything else you want to have clarify. Jason Gursky : No. That was great. I appreciate the color. That\u2019s it for me. Bill Brown : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Noah Poponak : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Hey, Noah. Noah Poponak : Can you remind me, so the Environmental programs that are declining in Space and Intel, what quarter does the start going against you? Bill Brown : They started in Q1. So we saw in Q1 the Environmental business rolled down about 10% to 15% and that -- about 15% and we see that about the same for the balance of the year. Rahul Ghai : That\u2019s little bit worse, about the same for Q2 and then maybe little bit worse in the back half of the year. Bill Brown : Lot of it\u2019s, Noah, is the roll-off of the GOES-R program which was last year, plus we\u2019ve got a couple of sensors that we are developing for these NASA NOAA satellites. They call the JPSS, the joint polar satellite system and then the 3 and 4, I think, they call Polar Follow-On, so they change the name on it. But we have got some sensors on that and there had been some funding pressure around the Polar Follow-On mission, which is JPSS-3 and -4. Noah Poponak : GOES-R was declining in the back half of last year? Bill Brown : GOES-R was kind of overall flat, Noah, \u201816 to \u201817 was kind of flat and then it declined substantially this year. Rahul Ghai : Yeah. Historically, this year we have little bit the back end of fiscal \u201817, I remember the satellite launched in November of 2016, calendar \u201816. Noah Poponak : All right. Yeah. I guess, I am wondering, is just, you grew, the segment grew 3% in the quarter despite the Environmental programs headwind and the guidance for the year is flat to up 1, you have to be basically exactly flat for rest of the year to be in that range. So you would have to decele from the first quarter, even though you grew in the first quarter with the headwinds and even though the year-over-year comparisons in the back half of the year are much easier? So does that headwind accelerate for the year or is there something else that goes against you later in the year that didn\u2019t in the quarter? Bill Brown : No. I think, Noah, I think, you have got most of it. So the headwind does accelerate a little bit on the Environmental side. Classified we are expecting about 5% for the full year. It grew about 8% in Q1, so not as stronger growth in the Classified side on the back half of the year. Noah Poponak : Okay. And then, similar question on the margin and the segment, I mean, you are sort of 100 basis points above the high end of the range in the first quarter, you would have to be much lower the rest of the year to get into the low -- certainly the low end of the range. What changes in the margin for the year in Space and Intel? Rahul Ghai : Yeah. And those margins, typically fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, depending on the mix and we have some lot true-ups on a couple of program and that helped margins in Q1. Having said that, the margin was strong and -- in the first quarter and you really feel good about where the margins -- where -- about the full year guidance for the segment or margins. Noah Poponak : Okay. Okay. Great. So then, one other question on the, I guess, in the legacy Harris domestic tactical radio business. I had sort of always brought up the model as the legacy base business, which I estimated and maybe even said made it to about $300 million last year and then we are sort of layering on all the new program win and just sort of assuming and it felt like even hoping that the $300 million legacy base before new programs business that just hang on to $300 million, because there is some reason to believe there could be cannibalization of that as new programs came on line? And then when you announced this maybe win about a month ago sort of made one come to the realization that actually about $50 million piece of that $300 million, if the IDIQ conversion holds, now is itself tripling and so why, I guess, is that true of that maybe piece of that business? And then two in the remainder of that $300 million, is there anything that is going to shrink considerably over the next one year, two years, three years or is there anything else in there that has the potential to grow in size as much as of that Navy business just that for you? Bill Brown : Yeah. I think, you are about right on the $300 million in terms of base funding and that that has been relatively stable over last couple of years. We do see depends on what -- where you characterize some of the readiness investment we saw in Q1. Of about $100 million in order, so does that sort of go into base or is that an upsize sort of the mix of the two, but you are largely about right. The Navy IDIQ award is very encouraging coming in and it was sole-sourced Harris to replace something that expires, so it was fully exhausted the prior contract vehicle. And what I think it reflects is, if you look in the slide deck and you will see out of a couple of years the Marine Corps is going to start to modernize. It happens in, I think, it\u2019s in the fiscal \u201819, fiscal \u201820 timeframe and its start to grow quite large and I think the IDIQ vehicle is size such that it compensates for, it allows us for that modernization at Marine Corps to happen. So that will be beyond our fiscal \u201818, it will start in \u201819 and \u201820. That, I think, Noah, is actually encouraging for us overall for where we see the business growing to beyond fiscal \u201818. Noah Poponak : Yeah. Is there anything else in the -- so in the remaining $250 million of the $300 million ex that Navy fee, anything else in there we should be watching out for that, has the contract renewal coming up or that has some meaningful potential to grow a lot going forward? Bill Brown : No. Nothing to point to. No. It\u2019s going to be relatively stable. It\u2019s going to be reset in spears and repairs and things that we typically do. There is a number of [ph] 17TGs (47:33) in the inventory. There is 152A. There is SINCGARS radios that had some flow-through. It is not big but flow-through there. There are going to be some investment over the next couple of years in terms of this crypto mod upgrade. They won\u2019t replace all the radios in DoD inventory by the NSA Cert -- the deadline which I think is in 2021 is the timeframe. So there have to be some investment to upgrade the cryptography on the legacy radios that are sitting in there. So there is really nothing specific to the point to, Noah, and we will talk more of that that as we see it over time, but we see it relatively stable. Noah Poponak : Got it. Bill Brown : Yeah. Noah Poponak : Okay. Thank you. Bill Brown : You bet, Noah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Bill Brown : God morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just on ES if I could, maybe follow up, is there -- that\u2019s also trending above the high-end of your segment guidance. What sort of driving the balance for the rest of the year? Rahul Ghai : Sorry, Sheila, could you\u2026 Bill Brown : Are you talking Sheila on ES, if I hear that right? Sheila Kahyaoglu : Can you hear me better. Bill Brown : Okay. Rahul Ghai : You are asking Electronic Systems, I didn\u2019t break it the front\u2026 Sheila Kahyaoglu : Yeah. Exactly. Just the margins trending better in the quarter and what changes throughout the year? Rahul Ghai : Yeah. So, Sheila, again, the margins kind of, same thing on Space, the margins do fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t provide kind of quarterly guidance on margins. But the fact was that we are makes a little bit more skewed toward fixed price program that helps and also there were some closeout on fixed price programs in the quarter that helped margins as well. So, again, really good start to the year and we feel good about where the year happens to be or guidance happens to be for full year. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. And then, just F-35 program, how do we think about if you could size it for us or how do we think about the build rates and potential content wins and what that means for the Harris growth rate for that program for \u201818? Bill Brown : Yeah. Look, we have good content on F-35. It\u2019s just over $2 million for shipset that we provide the common component -- avionic components backplane, liquid-cooled racks, things like that. We also provide the antennas for the -- they call the metal the multifunction data link. And then we also provide release systems as well, so the carriage and release. We talked about an award we received in Q1 associated with F-35 release systems. So, overall, it\u2019s just over $2 million. We are on, well, I think, LRIP 10 on the release systems in LRIP 12 on the\u2026 Rahul Ghai : Avionics. Bill Brown : \u2026 common components and the avionics systems, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation around block buys. We are working with our partners on that is to how they might flow in and get shaped over the course of the year. But we\u2019ve also won some recent content. We own the aircraft memory system, which was a big important win for us. We won the panoramic cockpit display electronic unit, so they head down display electronic unit and that adds, call it 5% to 10% roughly to the content for shipset and that will flow in over time. So we are performing very, very well. We have very high delivery rates. We have been working strong with our partners and taking cost out and driving improvement for the liability we\u2019ve invested in open system technologies. So we have an opportunity to compete for a new mission system to open system over time and we are very competitive in that space. So, overall, we think F-35 is going to be a good -- has been and we will continue to be a good story for us, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. And then, Bill, just a last one, you mentioned later radio program? Bill Brown : Yes. Sheila Kahyaoglu : If you could just provide RFP timeline for that and just a sizing of that opportunity? Bill Brown : Sure. The RFP is out. The proposals are in. We expect an award sometime in early calendar \u201818. It will build off of the existing rifleman radio IDIQ was -- the IDIQ was contemplated originally at $3.9 billion to include the possibility of a two-channel radio. That in fact is happening. And we will provide some small number of radios for testing in the early part of next year and will ramp for us in fiscal \u201819. Operator : And our final question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Bill Brown : Hey. Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard : Bill, you commented already, but one thing I thought it worth asking, and you highlighted a very strong book-to-bill in Q1. I was wondering if you sort of thing pull forward into the first quarter and whether the assuming continue resolution might have any impact on DoD orders in the quarter? Bill Brown : Not particularly. There were, obviously, Australia was an important component to that in the CS business, but even excluding that we had very good book-to-bill internationally in DOD. We actually saw a couple of things that moved out of September and October that we had hoped would happen in September. But -- we are on good track for them in Q2. And again similar good trajectory right now in Electronic Systems, as well as Space and Intel, so nothing in particular that I would characterize as a pull forward because of the end of the fiscal year. I mean, as we normally see, as you know we normally see that at the end of fiscal year September that tends to be a big booking month and was again, but nothing unusual that we saw this year relative to the prior years. Rahul Ghai : So just to put final\u2026 Robert Stallard : Okay. Rahul Ghai : Sorry, Rob, just to put a final point on that and even so overall our book-to-bill was 2.3, sorry, 1.6 and even if you exclude Australia it was 1.45. So and compare that last year it was about 1.20. So even excluding Australia the book-to-bill was really good. Bill Brown : Yeah. Yeah. Robert Stallard : Yeah. I have follow-up to ask, the attempt to nail this down annually than quarterly, are you still confident that you will have a book-to-bill over one times for the year? Bill Brown : Yes. We believe it will be more than one. In fact it should be, I wouldn\u2019t substantially, but because of Australia and the CS segment, we are much more confident there in more substantial book-to-bill for the year. Robert Stallard : That\u2019s great. Thanks go much. Bill Brown : Sure. Okay. Well, thank you, everybody. Before we end the call, I would like to make sure we thank the Harris team for delivering a strong quarter despite the impact of Hurricane Irma to our Florida operations, which as many know has more than 6,000 employees. The storm passed early on a Monday morning. We partially restarted operations on Tuesday and we are back to nearly 100% by Wednesdays and this remarkable was within 48 hours and I am very, very pleased and proud of the team performance. I am also proud that our customers experienced no significant disruption of service, including the FAA which relies on a network operations center here in Florida to monitor air traffic across North American airspace, as well as the first responders that we support throughout the state of Florida. So we responded very, very well and I\u2019m very pleased and proud of the team. Overall we had good start to the year. We are confident both our fiscal \u201818 and medium-term outlook. We are in an environment where defense budgets are coming up, the technology solutions we provide are aligned with the mission priorities of our customers and very importantly, we have a dedicated team that\u2019s geared towards exceeding customer expectations and delivering shareholder value. So thank everybody for joining the call and we will speak again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements made today involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information and related discussion, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris\u2019 SEC filings. In addition, discussions today will include non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures discussed today to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. William Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported solid second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 6% revenue growth, including an incremental $0.21 benefit from the recently enacted tax reform legislation. Excluding the benefit, non-GAAP earnings per share was up about 6%. Free cash flow increased 15% to $258 million, and we returned $143 million to shareholders, including $75 million in share repurchases. We continue to build on first quarter momentum to drive top line growth, with orders up 13% in the quarter and 24% in the first-half. So let me start with a little more color on growth drivers across the segments noted on Slide 4. Communication Systems revenue grew 18% in the quarter with tactical radio up 26% from strength in both DoD and International. DoD revenue increased 56%, as the focus on readiness continued to drive demand. We booked about $100 million in radio revenue in the quarter from the Air Force and the Army as part of a multi-year plan to equip their security forces as they increase their presence overseas. For the first-half, despite limited modernization activity, DoD orders nearly doubled and revenue grew 26% on the back of sustained readiness demand. Army and SOCOM tactical modernization programs continued to advance and remain well supported. We will start delivering HMS manpack test radios as the army prepares for field-based risk reduction in the spring of this year, and we expect an initial production award towards the end of our fiscal 2018. The protest on the army two channel leader radio was recently denied and we expect an order soon on the IDIQ, while we work with the army as it prepares for tests. For the SOCOM two channel handheld, we\u2019ve delivered our first set of test radios and remain on track to complete development this quarter and begin product deliveries in the fourth quarter. Overall, all programs are moving forward and we continue to expect revenue to ramp starting in fiscal 2019. In International, revenue increased 9%, primarily from better than expected recovery in the Middle East, where revenue was up by more than 50%, driven by modernization of security forces in Iraq, delivery SINCGARS radios to Saudi Arabia, and the technology refresh for a longstanding customer in the region. In Iraq, our pipeline is over $0.5 billion, and we\u2019re beginning to see several opportunities break free, as the country moves from grant funded counterterrorism to border security and eventually to command and control systems as they standardize across the forces and the Ministry of Interior. The solid first-half performance in the Middle East combined with strength in Africa drove international revenue up 1% for the half and book-to-bill greater than 1%, excluding Australia. Overall, for the first-half of the fiscal year, tactical revenues increased 10%, orders grew 54%, and book-to-bill was 1.6%, resulting in a backlog increase of 59% year-over-year to $884 million. More than 50% of second-half tactical revenue is covered in backlog, up 10 percentage points from this time last year, giving us comfort in achieving our increased segment guidance. In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 2% for the quarter, 6% excluding the $22 million impact of ADS-B. This was driven by strong double-digit growth in Avionics as we continue to benefit from higher volume and new content wins on F-35. The ramp up on the UK robotics program and growth in electronic warfare systems on legacy platforms, such as the F/A-18 and international F-16s. Orders momentum continues to be strong in Electronic Systems and were up 37% for the second quarter. Similar to last quarter, Avionics orders more than doubled compared with the last year, as the ramp on F-35 continues, including the award of LRIP 11 for release systems and block buy of LRIP 12-14 for antennas. For F-35, in the first-half, we received orders of $300 million, which is significantly more than what we achieved in all of fiscal 2017. In addition to F-35, we\u2019ve seen strong first-half orders on both F-18 and F-16, receiving a combined $300 million for Avionics and electronic warfare systems. We expect the order momentum across these three platforms to continue in the second-half. Overall, for ES, first-half orders grew 21%, book-to-bill was 1.3% and backlog increased 10% over the prior year. In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was down 1% in the quarter as growth in classified programs and commercial reflectors was offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Orders continued to be strong in the classified arena, with additional funding received for a small sat program and a multimillion dollar award for advanced ground processing. And I\u2019m pleased to note that our strong focus on program execution and operational excellence is strengthening our competitive position on key strategic programs. On GPS, we\u2019re executing well and we\u2019ve established a proven and reliable production cadence delivering our fourth GPS III navigation payload in October and tracking well to deliver the fifth payload by the end of March. We\u2019ve also developed and tested a fully digital Mission Data Unit, which puts us in a strong position to compete for the upcoming GPS III 11+ award and maintain our incumbency. Similarly, on the SENSOR program, the large ground radar sustainment effort for the Air force, we continue to improve on-time performance, which is more than doubled since we acquired Exelis, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and positioning us well for follow-on opportunities. For Space and Intel, first-half revenue was up 1%, orders grew by 9%, and book-to-bill was greater than 1. Solid second quarter results for the company capped an encouraging first-half performance with revenue up 3% and growth across all three segments; order growth of 24%, book-to-bill of 1.3%, and a backlog increase of 15% compared to the prior year. This combined with nearly 80% of back-half revenues and backlog or high probability follow-on opportunities, a strong and growing pipeline and $8 billion of proposals outstanding give us confidence despite a lengthened CR to take tighten our revenue guidance to up 3% to 4% from 2% to 4% previously. We\u2019re maintaining company operating margin guidance of 19% to 19.5%. But within that range, we\u2019re planning an incremental investment of approximately $20 million in IRAD to strengthen our position and capture new market opportunities in areas, such as small sats, software-defined electronic warfare systems, open system Avionics and robotics. These have been focused areas for several years. But due to our recent success and customer pool, we\u2019re increasing investment in these initiatives to drive innovation and affordability for our customers. We\u2019re also investing in human capital and making a one-time stock grant of 10 shares to all non-executive employees. Our most important asset in driving long-term customer and shareholder value. And then finally, we anticipate prefunding the pension plan by $300 million during our fiscal Q3. We\u2019re making these additional investments in the context of the recently inactive tax legislation, which is a net positive for Harris and for the U.S. economy as a whole. We expect tax reform to reduce our effective rate by about 10 percentage points next year, with about half of that reduction impacting this year and adding about $50 million to fiscal 2018 net income. This benefit combined with an improved revenue outlook and strong operational performance offsetting incremental investment gives us confidence to increase fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $6.30 to $6.50 per share and free cash flow to about $900 million. So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before we open the call to questions. Rahul? Rahul Ghai : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to total company results on Slide 5. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding non-cash charges in the quarter from a $52 million one-time write-down of deferred tax assets and a $12 million adjustment for deferred compensation, as well as prior year Exelis acquisition-related charges. The revenue was up 6% during the second quarter and operating income was down $6 million, as higher volume and operational efficiencies were more than offset by contract adjustments in the Mission Networks business. EPS was up 21%, or $0.29, including a $0.21 incremental benefit from tax reform. This benefit included a catch-up from the first quarter, resulting in a 11 point reduction in the Q2 tax rate, since the tax reform impact must be spread across all four quarters of our fiscal 2018. For the first-half, revenue was up 3% and operating income was up 1%, despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program. Operating margin was 18.9%. Free cash flow was robust in the first-half at $330 million, a 34% increase over the prior year. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was $934 million. Turning now to segment details on Slide 6. Communication Systems second quarter revenue was $489 million, up 18% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in tactical, Night Vision revenue was also up double digits as the business continues to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 19% at $144 million, compared with $121 million in the prior year, driven by higher volume, operational excellence and integration savings. Orders grew by 21%, resulting in a book-to-bill of approximately 1 for the quarter. For the first-half of the year, segment revenue was up 7% and operating income was up 10%. Operating margin of 29.1% was up 70 basis points versus the prior year. Segment orders increased 44% in the first-half and book-to-bill was 1.5. Notably, the book-to-bill was above 1 for each of the three businesses in the segment; Tactical Communications, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for tactical orders, revenue and backlog, as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. On Slide 7. Electronic Systems revenue was $584 million, up 2% for the quarter. The $33 million decline in segment operating income was driven by contract adjustments in the Mission Networks business, including a $22 million headwind from the ADS-B program. Increased R&D expense and unfavorable mix, partially offset by strong performance on electronic warfare programs and the benefit of higher volume in Avionics. First-half segment revenue was up 2%, while operating income was down 14%, or $36 million, as the increase in volume was offset by ADS-B headwind and an increase in R&D. Operating margin remained strong at 18.7%. On Slide 8. Space and Intelligence Systems segment operating income was up 7% on revenue decline of 1%. For the first-half, revenue for the segment increased 1% and operating income was up 8%, resulting in 120 basis points of margin expansion from productivity and incremental pension income. Moving to Slides 9 and 10 for full-year guidance. As Bill indicated, we now expect revenue to be up 3% to 4% versus up 2% to 4% in the prior guidance, due to increased strength in Tactical Communications and in Avionics. We\u2019re increasing the EPS guidance from a range of $5.85 to $6.05 to a range of $6.30 to $6.50, driven by a better than expected operational performance and benefits of tax reform, partially offset by reinvestment into certain key franchisees. Strong execution is expected to deliver an additional $0.13 of EPS on higher volume and strong program management, partially offset by unfavorable mix in Electronic Systems. We will reinvest $0.12 of that into innovation and affordability and bid and proposal activity across the corporation. Tax reform and other tax efficiencies will drive the effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 down to approximately 23%. This combined with operational changes results in a $0.45 EPS increase. Total company margin is still expected to remain robust at 19% to 19.5%. We\u2019re tightening free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million from a range of $850 million to $900 million, reflecting the cash benefit from tax reform. Turning now to outlook at the segment level. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up 5% to 7% versus up 3% to 5% previously, driven by strength in Tactical Communications and Night Vision. Operating margin guidance range of 19.9 \u2013 sorry, operating margin guidance range of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be at the top-end of the previous range, up 4% to 5% versus up 3% to 5% previously, from better than expected outlook in Avionics and Electronic Warfare. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18% to 19% versus 19% to 20% previously, due to increased R&D and bid and proposal investments and unfavorable mix shift from products to program businesses. Space and Intelligence revenue guidance remains unchanged at flat to up 1%. Operating margins are now expected to be between 17% to 18% versus 16.5% to 17.5% previously, driven by higher productivity and strong program execution, partially offset by reinvestments in R&D. On Slide 11, we\u2019re updating the guidance for tax and share purchases. We have completed the $150 million of share buyback that we had initially planned and now expect to repurchase an additional $50 million in the second-half for a total of $200 million in share purchases for the fiscal year. And with that, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. William Brown : Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard : Bill, obviously, a very strong order intake in the first-half of the year. I was wondering how sustainable do you think this sort of order intake is, as we roll forward into the future, and whether you\u2019re seeing any change in the lead time between when the order is placed and when you expect to ship the product? William Brown : Well, we start out with a very good first-half \u2013 very good first quarter, because we booked Australia, recall in Q1, so a very strong book-to-bill in Q1, which really led into a good first-half. For the year, as we said last time, we do expect a book-to-bill of greater than 1. And as we see a CR turn into a healthy budget into what we hope to be a very healthy defense spending line in fiscal 2019, my expectation is, we\u2019ll continue to see orders growth beyond 2018 into 2019 and hopefully beyond 2019. So we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got a good start. We\u2019re building some good momentum. We\u2019re seeing lead time in order conversion, opportunity to order about the same. I know, there\u2019s an important effort focused on shortening the acquisition timeline, both in U.S. DoD, as well as in FM \u2013 on the FMS side. We haven\u2019t seen anything yet, except for a couple of pretty quick turn investments in readiness that were \u2013 for more urgent requirements. But I know, the department is focused on both accelerating DoD purchase, as well as getting FMS contracts done a lot faster than that have been before. Robert Stallard : Just a quick follow-up. You mentioned that the Middle East are becoming better than maybe you\u2019d been expecting in second quarter. What about some of the other regions, how did they fair? William Brown : Well, certainly, the Middle East was very good. We had anticipated the year to be up probably 40%-ish in the Middle East. It was a little bit stronger in Q2 than we expect that we\u2019re seeing the pipeline velocity in the Middle East a little bit faster than we had expected now which I think is all \u2013 is good news, and hopefully, we\u2019ll see that trend continuing into the back-half. So the Middle East has been very strong. Again, keep in mind, it\u2019s coming off of a relatively low base. So that\u2019s going to be pretty good, it\u2019s pretty broad-based. Iraq is very important in the Middle East. Saudi has been a good opportunity. We see good opportunities in Northern Africa as well, and as well as Sub-Saharan. So overall, pretty good trajectory in the Middle East. We will see the Asia Pacific region grow pretty aggressively this year, probably about the same by 40%, principally due to Australia, but also because of some other countries in Southeast Asia. So again, good momentum in in Asia. We\u2019ll see a tick-down this year in Europe. It will be down probably double digits off a record year last year and record second-half in Eastern Europe, and then in Central, in Latin America, as well as Central Asia, will likely be down pretty significantly this year. So overall, international on a revenue basis, we still see it where we did before, flat to down slightly, although the DoD business will be stronger this year. Robert Stallard : That\u2019s great. Thanks so much. William Brown : You bet, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv : Hey, guys, good morning. William Brown : Good morning, Jon. Jon Raviv : Could you just provide an \u2013 could you provide us something of an update on some of your free cash flow goals post the tax reform act. I think, previously we\u2019ve talked a lot about $1 billion, you are approaching that, any thoughts on where that might go over the next few years? William Brown : Well, we will see this year as we went up by at the center point $25 million from between $580 million to $900 million, so now we\u2019re guiding at $900 million. Tax reform this year is about $50 million. But because of elongated continuing resolution, some of our revenue will price up to the back-end of the year. What that means is, we might have a little pressure on collection. So which is why we conservatively boosted our free cash guidance to about $900 million. Going into next year with tax reform, we see an incremental $50 million to $75 million of free cash just on tax itself. So that puts us into $950 million to $975 million range with earnings growth and working capital performance. We could see a path to get into a $1 billion in fiscal 2019. And as we think about how we deploy that, overall, we don\u2019t see much of a change to our overall philosophy on capital deployment. We\u2019ll continue to remain balanced and shareholder-friendly and making sure, we maintain a healthy balance sheet. Rahul did mention that, in the near-term, we\u2019re going to increase our share repurchases this year from $150 million to $200 million. We will pay a debt that\u2019s due, it\u2019s about $0.5 billion in April. We\u2019re going to prefund our pension. We anticipate doing that here in our third quarter. We\u2019ll borrow to do that. And as we go into 2019 and beyond, longer-term, not much of a change in our overall priorities. We\u2019ll continue to complete the fund all of the great investments we have internally in R&D and capital spending. We\u2019re going to continue to pay a very good dividend, which we\u2019ve been paying pretty, pretty aggressively over the last decade or more. And any balance that\u2019s remaining on free cash will be deployed to M&A or share buyback. And if you think about the numbers, we\u2019ll be generating probably a couple of billion dollars between 2018 and 2019 gives a lot of firepower for both share buyback, as well as potential M&A. Jon Raviv : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then also on the CapEx question, you mentioned that the allocation priorities might not change too much. We\u2019re seeing some other companies really get ahead of what I anticipate to be greater growth in terms of ramp in CapEx. How are you guys thinking through your capital investment problem? William Brown : Well, I think \u2013 yes, Jon, the difference with Harris is that, over the last five or six years, we have invested in capital in the company. If you go back six years, we were over $300 million, a share of $1.30. So a lot of the investments that we\u2019ve made were to upgrade our infrastructure, upgrade our capacity. We\u2019ve got a relatively brand new tactical radio facility up in Rochester, it\u2019s running at 60% or so utilization. So we don\u2019t have any internal capacity constraints relative to satisfying the increasing demand. But what we have done is, step up over the last five or six years in R&D and we\u2019re doing that again internal investments in R&D. Harris spends more than in term \u2013 on a relative basis relative to revenue than anyone on our segment or taking it even further, we\u2019ve been running at about 5% of revenue, and this year, we\u2019ll take it up to 5.2%, 5.3%. So we continue to invest very heavily in both R&D and over a period of time in capital spending. Our capital this year of $130 is about 2.2% of revenue, we feel pretty good about that. Jon Raviv : Thanks so much. William Brown : You bet, Jon. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. William Brown : Good morning, Rob. Robert Spingarn : I wanted to see if we could just go to your Slide 12 on the Tactical Com history. You talked about, Bill, your strong first quarter intake. You\u2019ve now got record revenues in the second quarter. And combining that in with the DoD backdrop you just talked about and the madness push on readiness, how do we see Tactical Comms going forward? Do you think revenue \u2013 quarterly revenues to move up from here, given that your backlog is still at record levels? William Brown : We do see quarterly revenue increasing in the back-half. We see continued strong growth in DoD. We had a very good start, very good orders here in the second quarter, again, a lot of it driven by readiness, quick turn orders. As we look into the back-half, we see continued strong double-digit growth. We were guiding to be up mid-teens last quarter. We\u2019re now moving to be up in the low 20s on tactical revenue DoD, and that feels, feels a good pretty good spot to be. And we probably have overall for tactical more than half of our second-half that\u2019s currently in backlog flowing out in backlog in the back-half. But keep in mind, on the international side, we\u2019ve got a few orders in there that are longer duration like Australia, it\u2019ll be rolling out over the next couple of three years. We\u2019ll see part of that moving in the back-half. So we will see growth in the back-half in the international on a sequential basis. Year-over-year, it will be down a little bit, because we\u2019re coming off a pretty strong compare last year with good performance in Eastern Europe. I think, overall, that\u2019s how I see us tracking over the back-end of this year. Robert Spingarn : Okay. So we don\u2019t see a peak in Tactical Comms anytime soon, that\u2019s kind of where I was going. Then I have a similar question on F-35 on your long-term outlook. So\u2026 William Brown : Yes, we don\u2019t see a peak \u2013 we\u2019re not at a peak by any stretch on the tactical business. I think, we\u2019re in my view, certainly on the DoD side, we\u2019re at the front-end of what we hope to be a steep curve that\u2019s coming. And based on just what we see happening in modernization, both in the Army, DoD, eventually in the Marine Corps out of couple of years. If you look at the five-year budget and that by the way has not been changing very much. You\u2019ll see a good ramp in DoD. We expect to capture a piece \u2013 a good chunk of that. On the F-35, we\u2019re still in a low-rate production, and we\u2019re on 11 and 12 and we\u2019re still ramping up. So we think that that\u2019s going to continue to grow over the next couple of years. Robert Spingarn : I was going to say, do you have an idea timing-wise, when you would get up to the 150 ship sets per year, which I believe is what Lockheed is targeting as the mature peak rate? William Brown : Yes, probably about a year or two from now. We\u2019re probably at the fore front\u2026 Robert Spingarn : Okay. William Brown : And we\u2019re probably \u2013 certainly, on the common component side, the stuff that goes in the aircraft, we\u2019re probably on the front end on the release systems. We\u2019re probably on the back-end, we\u2019re at lot 11. So there\u2019s \u2013 they come in different pieces and ramp at different rates. But I would say, on the common components, we\u2019ll probably hit that a little bit faster than we\u2019ll be on the release systems. Rahul Ghai : And generally\u2026. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And just\u2026 Rahul Ghai : Sorry, this is Rahul. So just generally, we\u2019re little bit ahead of Lockheed, because we\u2019re, as Bill mentioned, we\u2019re in LRIP 11 on the release systems and 12 on the Avionics. So we\u2019re generally, we\u2019re ahead of the normal ramp up curve. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then just wanted to ask, you mentioned a couple of times reinvestment. And while you said, you\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s not a big C change in CapEx plans, you do you have some higher R&D here and there. Could you just review the franchises that you\u2019re putting that money into? Where should we look for Harris to really be developing any incremental strengths beyond those you already have? William Brown : Look, we\u2019ve been investing pretty aggressively in our tactical business over the last number of years, and that probably is about 35% of our IRAD spend. So that\u2019s \u2013 that has remained high and will continue to remain high and it would be fully funded, it\u2019s very, very good return. But where we\u2019re stepping up is in Electronic Systems, as well as in the space and Intel segment. In both segments, they were a little bit below tactical and they\u2019re coming up quite dramatically over the last couple of years. And it\u2019s going to be an area in like open systems Avionics. So we have opportunities to change out Avionics from newer platforms, as well as next-gen platforms in Avionics. We\u2019re developing software-defined electronic warfare systems, both for legacy platforms, but also perhaps onboarding on to the newer generation aircraft. We\u2019re investing in robotics. We won a pretty good size contract for EOD in the UK. And we think that it\u2019s good opportunities to grow robotics beyond the UK into other international markets maybe even into the U.S. DoD over time as well. And then on the space side, we\u2019ve been penetrating the market for small satellites and hosted payloads. We\u2019ve been winning some awards in a classified community and we\u2019re going to continue to invest to win in those areas. These are very, very clear trends that we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re investing ahead of the curve. Robert Spingarn : That\u2019s great. Thank you so much for the extra color. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. William Brown : Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I was hoping we could maybe revisit Communication Systems and the longer-term margin profile of the business. As you ramp up on new opportunities and also new business wins, how do you think of the puts and takes for the longer-term margin profile? Rahul Ghai : Good morning, Sheila. So I think the margin, we feel good about remaining in the range that we have that we\u2019ve guided to this year. The couple of things that will kind of move around. As the volume ramps up, there will be incremental benefit from drop, too, just given the tactical margins being higher than the segment margins. But also the mix is skewing a little bit towards more program business like that in Australia. And also the fact is, the DoD modernization is going to come in lower, at least, in the initial stages than the margins that we currently have. So you put that all that together between volume benefit and some mix shift and lower margin DoD business relative to where we are right now in the initial phases, we feel good about where we are right now. I think, that\u2019s where we expect, at least, 2019 to be. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then just one more, I think, Bill, you mentioned $8 billion of proposal outstanding. If you could elaborate on some of the big opportunities, the big one was $500 million within Iraq. If you could talk about some of the other items? William Brown : Well, it\u2019s really across the business. When I look at what\u2019s happening in Electronic Systems, we\u2019ve got a very strong pipeline to upgrade, for example, international F-16s for EW systems. We\u2019ve got opportunities to continue to grow our business in air traffic management. We\u2019ve got opportunities on the Avionics side. And on the space side, there\u2019s tremendous opportunities in growing in the classified community. The budgets on the classified side are growing mid single digits in the areas where we have been competing, they\u2019re slightly better than that. We have found a good way to penetrate that and be competitive and we\u2019re seeing a lot of opportunities start to enter our pipeline on the classified side. So it\u2019s pretty broad-based across the company when I look at it. And of course, we\u2019ve got good opportunities sitting in the tactical side. The tactical pipelines are running around $2.5 billion on the international side, about $1 billion, $4 billion $5.1 billion on the DoD side. So, look, Sheila, it\u2019s really across the company, where we see good strength in the pipeline. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. William Brown : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks, guys. Good morning. William Brown : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : Couple of questions. First, I was wondering, if you could give us some directional color on cash pension contribution in fiscal 2019? Rahul Ghai : Gautam, we\u2019re not expecting with the prefunding that Bill just mentioned, the $300 million that we\u2019re thinking of doing in Q3. We don\u2019t expect any pension contributions now through 2025. So that we\u2019ll prefund the pension for the next several years. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just to \u2013 the cash flow guidance for the year, free cash flow guidance, does that exclude the $300 million? Rahul Ghai : Yes, it does. William Brown : But no sorry, the $900 million does not include a pension prefunding. Rahul Ghai : Right. William Brown : Just to be perfectly clear on that. Gautam Khanna : Got it, okay. What \u2013 how would you size the initial JTRS Manpack production award that you\u2019re expecting in fiscal Q4? How large do you think it might be between the two suppliers? And any color how that may\u2026? William Brown : Yes, it\u2019s still working through \u2013 it\u2019s still working its way through Army acquisition, and it would be for a couple of BCTs. In my understanding is, it could be in the range of about 3,000 units. We don\u2019t price that, but it will be about 3,000 units. And we do expect that it\u2019ll be split basically 50-50 between us and the other player in the IDIQ in that range. Again, it\u2019s still working its way through Army acquisition. So we\u2019ll know more as that decision is made. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And then in subsequent years, what do you anticipate that today? Is it going to be 3,000 units per year, or what do you think\u2026? William Brown : No, we think that this is \u2013 yes, we think it\u2019s going to grow from there. When you look at just where the 2018 budget is at $355 million, up from, I think, it was only $275 million or so last year. So the budgets for HMS includes the rifle and our own on-and-off swing. So I would expect that revenue will ramp in 2019 on the manpack and continue to grow thereafter as really at the front-end of the sort of the recapitalization and the modernization of the tactical radio franchise within the army. Gautam Khanna : And I know you didn\u2019t want to talk about price. But in the fiscal 2018 request, you can see the government\u2019s estimate of price of around 62,000 or so per unit. Is that \u2013 should we expect it to be far off of that mark, or is there a reason to think it\u2019s going to be a lot lower? William Brown : I think that, what you don\u2019t see is what the army builds into those cost estimates. Sometimes it\u2019s just the radio, plus accessories, plus army program management costs could be vehicular adaptors, it could be a variety of things. So it\u2019s not a pure number, Gautam. And so I would take it with some grain of caution. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Last question just, on the F-35, you mentioned picking up some more content on it. Could you refresh us on what your revenue per F-35 is sitting at today? William Brown : Yes, we\u2019re sitting today at about \u2013 roughly about $2.2 million per ship set. We have a number of pieces. One is the release system, so the bomb release or charge release systems for the F-35. We have a variety of common components, meaning, they\u2019re common across the three different variants, liquid cool racks and power supplies. We do the antenna as well. And we very recently within the last year, one of the electronic unit for the Panoramic Cockpit Display, that was about $320 million, that\u2019s a front-end of its development. So that will onboard probably several years from now. And then we won about a year ago or within the last year, the aircraft memory system upgrade with a contract valued about $140 million. So overall, we\u2019re running 2.2, but we do see opportunities to drive that up if we\u2019re successful in winning the open system mission computer, which will be down selected again to a final winner, one of the three down selected companies today. But the final one probably to the next couple of years. So we\u2019re pretty hopeful about additional content on the F-31. Gautam Khanna : Bill, I said that was my last. I wanted to sneak one more. And you mentioned, share repurchase \u2013 cash deployment opportunities, and Exelis now is well digested, I would say. What are you thinking in terms of acquisition priorities? Is there much of a pipeline, what do you think about valuations, or any color on what the next five years look like for the company? William Brown : Well, I think, look, M&A is part of what we want to do longer-term. I think, we\u2019ve \u2013 we did a good job at buying Exelis at a good part in the cycle \u2013 good point in the cycle and we integrated well. We paid down debt. We paid down our pension obligation. We\u2019re going to be at probably 85% funded. So we\u2019ve done a very good job, I believe, in integration and managing our balance sheet. Now we\u2019re generating very strong cash. The working capital turns have improved pretty dramatically both for Harris, as well as for legacy. Exelis, and you\u2019re seeing that come through in our free cash guidance. As we get into next year, we\u2019ll have a little bit of debt to pay down. It depends upon the length of time we borrow to fund the pension, but it does leave quite a bit of capacity for buybacks, for M&A. And the way I look at it is, we\u2019ll evaluate things very, very carefully. The prices are relatively high, and we don\u2019t need to buy anything to be scale. We think we\u2019re scale in a place we want to be. We like the position we happen to have, but we\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities to bolt-on or add to the company in the key franchise that we\u2019re in today. Other than that, I don\u2019t think we have much more to say. Gautam Khanna : Thanks, guys. Good luck. William Brown : You bet, Gautam. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Pete Skibitski : Yes, good morning, guys. William Brown : Good morning, Pete. Pete Skibitski : Hey, Bill, I would like to talk more about Communication Systems, Bill, if we could from a different perspective and I kind of have a compound question. But a lot has been written on kind of the incremental Russian military threat, the ground threat, and it sounds like the U.S. Army, as well as Congress are pretty concerned about that. So I\u2019m wondering, are you sensing recently more kind of threat-driven incremental demand in radios? And at the same time, that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re hearing recently that the fiscal 2019 budget could be really attractive, maybe approaching 7% growth over \u2013 per year over the next couple of years, if you kind of average it out? So between that incremental threat out there and the inflecting budgets, Communication Systems are \u2013 would you err on the side of the outlook for Comms being closer to high single digits now than the prior mid single-digit outlook you gave, or is international side is just not enough visibility on the international side right now? William Brown : Well, I think, we\u2019ll wait until we see where the 2019 budget actually drops and what the fight that looks like to say if we\u2019re going to change any perspective for long-term growth in Communications, I saw the same reports about the 2019 budget. But again, until it actually drops, we don\u2019t know the size of it and maybe \u2013and even more importantly, the mix across different programs. But your point about what\u2019s driving communications tactical radio revenue, certainly, last year, it was a lot around investments in Eastern Europe in Comms to help drive the interoperability across NATO forces and with U.S. forces, and that was a big part of the surge we saw last year in Eastern Europe, and it continues at a pretty good pace even this year. And when you step back and look at some of the investments that the DoD is making now today in radios and maybe even some of the hesitancy in going forward, is really rethinking exactly what kind of radio Comms they want? What sort of waveforms they need? What\u2019s the bandwidth? Are they anti-jam? Are they at low probability of interception and detection? They\u2019re changing their thinking about it and it spills from not just communication, but also to the Electronic Warfare business and as a fundamental driver for why we\u2019re seeing increased investment and growth outlook in Electronic Warfare. It\u2019s all around how do our forces and our partner forces compete in places like Europe, given the Russian threat. So that is the backdrop for a lot of the trends that we\u2019ve seen in the business. And frankly, a lot of the investment that we\u2019re talking about that we\u2019ve made and are making now in our business to enhance our communications and spectrum warfare capabilities and drive opportunities here to communicate broadly, convey information, but to have then anti-jam, so they hop very quickly, as well as the LPI/LPD. So long answer, Pete. But that that\u2019s really the backdrop for what\u2019s happening driving an important trend across all of our Comms and EW businesses. Pete Skibitski : That\u2019s helpful. Let me ask a couple ancillary question to that. The new WIN-T strategy, as of today versus last quarter, give any greater clarity as to kind of what comes next post WIN-T, and if there would be an incremental benefit to Harris, or the same as last quarter for the most part? William Brown : It\u2019s about the same as last quarter. We\u2019re working very closely with the army as they rethink what they want the structure of the network, the architecture of the network to look like. It was a good result that they\u2019ve separated the upper tactical network, meaning, WIN-T from the lower tactical, meaning, the radios and they are moving forward with the radio purchases. We do have components on the upper tactical WIN-T system. We have the radio, the high band networking radio. We have the waveform, which is HNW. We have a new version of the waveform that\u2019s sitting out there now in the repository. I do believe that no matter what they do on the upper tactical network. There\u2019s a role for Harris to play, in fact, I think, it may be increasing as opposed to decreasing. The radio we\u2019ve developed and the waveform that\u2019s been developed, gives you a much faster rate of transmission. There\u2019s more nodes. It\u2019s a more mobile system, solving a lot of the issues that the army has had with WIN-T. So, Pete, on balance, I think, we\u2019re probably as good if not better position on WIN-T now than we were before. Pete Skibitski : Okay, great. Very helpful. If I could just sneak in one last one, I apologize. But on the EW front, this next-generation jammer, the low band, starting to see more out there on that. Is it still early there in terms of award date and sizing? And is this currently maybe one of the bigger competitive opportunities for ES? William Brown : This is one that we\u2019ve looked at for sometime and we continue to look at it, and I don\u2019t have much to say in terms of when that procurement will likely come through. It\u2019s been talked about for the last, at least, a couple of years that I\u2019ve heard about it. So we\u2019ll stay back, we\u2019ll look at it and evaluate. We participate directly or with another party in the space as we\u2019ve done before on a prior opportunity on that platform. Pete Skibitski : Got it. Thanks very much, guys. William Brown : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. William Brown : Good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman : As you start delivering manpack radios to the Army and they go through risk reduction and testing, are there any sort of outstanding technical challenges? And if so, what are they, or do you feel like you\u2019ve kind of gotten through all of that and it should be pretty smooth testing for you? William Brown : I think, the requirements are likely to get changed a little bit over time, Seth. To be honest with you, I think, the fundamental hardware of the radio won\u2019t change. But the beauty of these radios is that, they are software-defined. Their features, their functionality could be changed and upgraded over time with software downloads. And we\u2019ve seen that happen on the 117G. We\u2019ll see the same thing happen on our version of the manpack. So the capabilities will change over time. What we have demonstrated and our competitor in the space have demonstrated through the customer tests is basic functionality of the radio and the waveforms. And what they\u2019re now testing are some of the deferred threshold requirements like the ability for the radio to use the MUOS waveform, a very complicated waveform. Now we perfected that in putting it into the 117G. I don\u2019t expect that to be a problem and how it works in the manpack. So they\u2019re just going to test on the deferred threshold requirements is what \u2013 it\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now. But I do believe over time, these requirements will continue to shift as the threat environment shifts. Seth Seifman : Great. And then maybe last one, Bill, when you look at the thing they\u2019re considering for the organization of space acquisition in the Air Force and moving that into sort of its own dedicated area, how you think about the implications for Harris? William Brown : Well, look, we\u2019re an important player in the space side and we were very closely with our Air Force colleagues. We have very good relationships there. And I think, frankly, since we bought Exelis and expanded our capabilities there, and by the way, improved dramatically our performance on GPS, I think, our relationships there, our credibility has improved. We\u2019ve got a very, very strong team in Colorado Springs. It\u2019s a pretty broad-based set of capabilities, both on the unclassified as well as a classified domain. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think, we\u2019re well positioned. If they consider moving and creating a separate space for us, the way I look at this is, if you want to make improvements and really drive something like improvements on our space infrastructure, space architecture, separating that and making it a sole function of a part of the Air Force or separate from the Air Force could only be \u2013 drive good benefits, because that will drive more investment in the area, and I think, we would see some of the results of that. So I think, if anything that would be a positive for Harris over time. Seth Seifman : Great. Thanks very much. William Brown : You bet, Seth. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Josh Sullivan : Hey, good morning. William Brown : Hey, good morning, Josh. Josh Sullivan : I think, you\u2019d mentioned on the Electronic Warfare side upgrades for the international F-16s. Is there anyway to size that and is there a similar opportunity for maybe F-18s? William Brown : Well, we do provide the, what we call, the IDECM system for F-18 that\u2019s both for U.S. as well as international variants of the F-18. And we\u2019ve been receiving some pretty healthy orders very recently on F-18s for U.S. Navy and Australia and we do see opportunities to continue to grow that. On the F-16, it will go through the FMS process. There\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know eight or 10 different countries around the world that use F-16s, and we are the legacy EW provider on international F-16s, not domestic ones. So we do see quite a long tail of opportunities to well over $0.5 billion to upgrade international F-16s. Josh Sullivan : Okay. And then on Night Vision up double digits, it\u2019s been a legacy technology just what\u2019s driving that? And then is that sustainable going forward? William Brown : Yes, it\u2019s come off a pretty long decline going back, I don\u2019t know five or seven years with the wind down of some of the wars. And I think, we last year hit a bottom in fiscal 2017, we\u2019re down, I don\u2019t know 10% or so in fiscal 2017. But we\u2019ve seen through 2017 and now into 2018 very, very strong orders, good book-to-bill, backlog is coming up. In the first-half, we\u2019re up double-digit, Q2 was strong. We\u2019ll be up double-digit for the year. A lot of it is, I mean, there are some new technologies that are being played, a lot of it\u2019s refresh and resets of tubes and goggles for the DoD, as well as international partners. And there are some new technology investments that we have made around making, that will continue to see some, I think, good traction in the marketplace. But I think, a lot of it is refresh upgrades of existing goggles. Rahul Ghai : And where we are seeing growth of the \u2013 part of the reason why we are seeing growth is, because we improved our operational performance. So our throughput is higher and we\u2019ve been able to take the costs lower. When we bought Exelis, we couldn\u2019t ship the product for about a year, because you don\u2019t do that. I think, it was under short notice. We\u2019ve been working very hard to resolve some of the operational issues, and that\u2019s helped us win a very large share, both domestically and some of the international opportunities, that\u2019s starting to grow. Josh Sullivan : Okay. I\u2019ll just switch over to tech for the last one. You mentioned the Rochester facility is about 65%. How long do you think it takes you to get to the kind of 85% level? Rahul Ghai : Well, it depends on how quickly the volume ramps up and the DoD \u2013 the modernization kicks in, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to determine. I think, the point that Bill made earlier was the fact that, as even with incremental DoD volume, we don\u2019t see a need to make a capital investment in the facility. And we \u2013 business is still off at peak. I mean, I think we did the $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion going back a few years. So we still have ways to go before we reach 100% capacity utilization there. William Brown : And even as we fill up the factory today, if we do it a limit, there\u2019s things that we do in the factory that we can always find \u2013 we can always outsource to effectively increase capacity in the building. So we don\u2019t have any constraints that we see in the near-term or the medium-term. Josh Sullivan : Good. Thank you. William Brown : You bet. William Brown : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call this morning. And please do not hesitate to get in touch with me for any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you.",

Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Harris Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Discussions today will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.67, up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Revenue was up in all segments and operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 19.3%. These results extend our strong year-to-date performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first three quarters up 17% on 4% revenue growth and 10% higher free cash flow. The highlight again this quarter and for the year is our strong order momentum, up 27% in the quarter for our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit orders growth. Book-to-bill was 1.2 for the quarter and the year, with total company backlog increasing 22% over last year. So, let me start by providing some color on top line growth drivers across the segments noted on slide 4. Communication Systems' revenue grew 4% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Night Vision. DoD Tactical delivered another solid quarter with revenue up 48% as a focus on readiness continue to drive growth across our services, especially the Air Force and the Army, as they upgrade their legacy communication equipment to software-defined radios. The sustained readiness demand has driven a year-to-date increase in DoD orders of 62% and revenue growth of 32%, and we now expect DoD revenue to be up about 30% versus prior expectation of low 20% growth and up from mid-teens when we started the year. International Tactical revenue was down 12% as expected on a tough year-over-year compare, as Q3 2017 included a record $150 million of Eastern European revenue. The decline in Eastern Europe was partially offset by continued momentum in the Middle East and Africa, driven by ongoing counterterrorism support and by the ramp of these Australian modernization program in the Asia Pacific region. Strong orders growth of 15% for the quarter and 36% year-to-date has nearly doubled International backlog, providing more visibility going into the fourth quarter and next year. For the year, we still expect International will be flat to slightly down. As we've been communicating, our tactical strategy is to win all DoD ground radio programs, leverage platform investments to maintain International leadership and expand our adjustable market into network systems, ISR and airborne. And we continue to execute well against this strategy with several wins and accomplishments this quarter. On DoD ground radios, Army and SOCOM modernization programs continue to make solid progress. In the omnibus bill, the HMS program is well funded at $415 million in GFY 2018, more than 50% higher than the prior year and up an additional $60 million over the original GFY 2018 President's budget request. We delivered additional HMS Manpack test radios in the third quarter and, earlier this week, we received an LRIP delivery order from the Army to proceed with the next production phase for the Manpack radio, clearly demonstrating the Army's commitment to the program. On the Army two-channel handheld radio, we expect to deliver the first batch of test radios soon with an award anticipated sometime this summer. For the SOCOM two-channel handheld, we delivered initial test radios during the quarter and will ramp production in the fourth quarter, accelerating in fiscal 2019. Continuing our effort to expand into broader network systems, we recorded another win in Asia when we leveraged our radio incumbency position and were selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade the military communications network. This builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries as we continue to expand our aperture and increase customer stickiness. And then finally, just a few days ago, we were awarded a five-year $130 million sole-source IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link device to provide airborne collected ISR information to forces on the ground, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win against the incumbent helps us increase our share of wallet of ground devices and positions us well to grow in the airborne ISR segment going forward. Overall, for the first three quarters, Tactical revenue increased 7% with a book-to-bill of 1.4, resulting in a 74% year-over-year backlog increase to $880 million. This growth in Tactical, coupled with another strong quarter of double-digit growth in Night Vision, has enabled us to raise Communication Systems revenue guidance to an increase of 7% to 7.5% for the year versus the prior guidance of 5% to 7% and 3% to 5% when we started the year. In Electronic Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 10% for the quarter with growth across all ES businesses, as the first half ADS-B headwind subsided. This strong growth was driven by long-term platforms like the F-35, the F/A-18 and F-16, which collectively grew more than 25% as we leveraged technology upgrades, ramped production and expanded our International footprint. In Avionics, we continue to generate double-digit growth in weapons release systems, even excluding F-35 growth, with new content awards and increased production of both domestic and International platforms. Segment order growth accelerated in the quarter to 56% for a book-to-bill of 1.4 and orders are now up 32% on a year-to-date basis. We booked more than $300 million in orders across F-35, F/A-18 and F-16 platforms, including a $184 million contract supplying electronic jammers to protect U.S. Navy, Australian and Kuwaiti F/A-18 aircraft against electronic threats. Orders across the three platforms, F-35, F/A-18, F-16, have more than doubled this year to over $900 million and are on track to hit $1 billion for the year. Overall for ES, solid third quarter results have mitigated the first half ADS-B impact with year-to-date revenue now up 4% and a book-to-bill of 1.3, resulting in a backlog increase of 21%. This combined with an $18 billion opportunity pipeline and $4 billion in proposals outstanding gives us confidence that revenue will grow 4.5% to 5% this year and that the growth will accelerate in the medium-term. In Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 1% as Classified programs continue to grow mid-single digits from the ramp up of smallsat, ground-based adjacency and space surveillance programs, offset by expected headwinds on environmental programs. Order momentum also remained strong in the Classified area with additional customer funding for long-standing programs and new adjacencies. In addition, we were awarded an approximately $500 million multi-year contract to provide payloads for an exquisite classified space system, reflecting continued success in leveraging technology to not only expand as a full mission solution partner in smallsats, but also to strengthen our position as a partner of choice on large exquisite platforms. I'm also pleased to note a few accomplishments that strengthen our competitive position on important missions. In the environmental solutions business, the launch of NOAA's GOES-S satellite in early March included our second Advanced Baseline Imager, or ABI, which improves fire detection and severe weather forecasting. This follows a successful launch of GOES-R in November of 2016, which has provided unprecedented imagery of recent hurricanes with four times the resolution and five times the download speed, providing forecasters with 30-second updates of the entire Western Hemisphere. Harris ABIs are also on the last two of NOAA's latest generation of geostationary weather satellites, GOES-T and GOES-U, with the entire Constellation controlled by Harris' enterprise ground system. We continued to execute well on GPS with a proven and reliable production cadence that included delivering a fifth GPS III navigation payload in early March, 26 days ahead of schedule. Strong execution along with a developed and fully tested 100% digital mission data unit positions us well for the upcoming GPS III 11 Plus award. Year-to-date, Space and Intel revenue was up 1% and orders were up 6%, resulting in a book-to-bill of greater than 1. Our pipeline has grown by 14% to $13 billion over the past year and with the recent success of expanding into new adjacencies, we're confident this business can be a growth driver in the medium-term. In summary, with our strong year-to-date performance, continued order momentum and an improved outlook on the back of a favorable GFY 2018 budget resolution, we're tightening our fiscal 2018 guidance and now expect revenue to be up approximately 4% from the previous guidance of 3% to 4%. This growth, combined with our strong operating performance, gives us confidence to tighten our EPS guidance to $6.45 to $6.50 at the high end of the previous range and increase free cash flow to a range of $900 million to $925 million. And with that, let me turn it over to Rahul. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Starting with total company results on slide 5. As a reminder, (11:57) today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude one-time adjustments. Revenue was up 5% in the third quarter, with growth across all three segments. Operating income was up 7% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 30 basis points to 19.3%. EPS grew 21% and was up 12%, excluding the benefit of tax reform. Adjusted free cash flow was $121 million as higher revenues and order momentum in the backend of the quarter resulted in $120 million increase of receivables and inventory, which will unwind in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date revenue was up 4% and operating income was up 3% despite a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program transition in the first half of the year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was $451 million, a 10% increase over the prior year as we enter our strongest cash generation quarter. We have returned a total of about $400 million to shareholders, including approximately $200 million in share repurchases. In addition, we prefunded the pension by $300 million in the third quarter. On a last 12-month basis, adjusted free cash flow was about $900 million. Turning to the third quarter EPS bridge on slide 6, EPS grew by 21% or $0.29. Of this, $0.11 of EPS growth came from higher volume in Tactical radios, Avionics and Classified space, solid program execution and higher pension income. This was partially offset by lower environmental volume and increased R&D investment. Lower share count and reduced interest expense contributed $0.06. Lastly, a lower tax rate, including a benefit from tax reform, added $0.12 to EPS growth. Segment details on slide 7. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $481 million, up 4% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in DoD Tactical, Night Vision revenue was also up double digits, as the business continued to improve execution and increase its share of wallet with the Army. Operating income for the segment was up 5% to $147 million and operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 30.6% on higher volume. Orders grew for the seventh straight quarter, up 20% with a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strong bookings in Tactical, PSPC orders grew 28% on increased demand for legacy system upgrades from state and local agencies. Night Vision orders grew 10% with continued momentum from the U.S. Army and we received a $30 million award to support increased logistics readiness. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 6% and operating income was up 8%. Operating margin of 29.6% was up 50 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date segment orders have increased 36% with a book-to-bill of 1.3 and it's greater than 1 in all three businesses in the segment, Tactical, PSPC and Night Vision. We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. On slide 8, Electronic Systems' revenue was $609 million, up 10% for the quarter. In addition to the growth in Avionics and Electronic Warfare that Bill mentioned, we saw solid revenue increase from the ramp of UK robotics and UAE battle management programs. Segment operating income declined $3 million (16:11) was more than offset by increased R&D investment and program revenue mix. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 4% and operating margin was down to 18.6% as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program, R&D investment and program revenue mix. On slide 9, in Space and Intelligence Systems, segment revenue was up 1% and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 100 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. Year-to-date segment revenue was up 1% with continued growth in Classified programs, offset by a decline in environmental revenues. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 17.7%. Moving to slide 10 for full year guidance, as Bill indicated, given a strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up about 4% for the year, reflecting strength in DoD Tactical and Avionics. We're tightening the EPS guidance at the high end of the range to $6.45 to $6.50 from drop through on higher volume. Tax rate guidance is now 22.5% from 23% previously. The $0.04 benefit from lower tax rate will be offset by higher than expected share dilution and an increase in interest expense from the additional debt raised or pension prefunding. In Communication Systems, we are increasing the revenue guidance to be up 7% to 7.5% versus up 5% to 7% previously from improved DoD Tactical outlook and Night Vision readiness demand. In Electronic Systems, we are narrowing revenue guidance to the higher end of the range to be now up 4.5% to 5% versus up 4% to 5% previously as strong orders in Avionics convert to revenue. In Space and Intelligence, we are narrowing the revenue guidance to be up approximately 0.5% versus flat to up 1% previously. For each segment, margins are still expected to be around the midpoint of the guidance ranges, at about 30% in Communication Systems, 18.5% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence. We are increasing the adjusted free cash flow guidance from approximately $900 million to a range of $900 million to $925 million due to higher earnings. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for closing remarks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, thanks, Rahul. We are now in the final innings of fiscal 2018 and we feel good about our year-to-date results and our expectations for the balance of the year. The passage of the GFY 2018 Omnibus Bill and the trend line in the President's Budget in 2019 and beyond are real positives for Harris and the programs we support, especially in strategic growth areas where we have invested in R&D over the past several years and our strong customer positions. Tactical radio budget have increased by an additional $1 billion over the next five years compared with where they were this time last year. F-35 and F/A-18 aircraft quantities have been increased, Classified space and other IC budgets are trending up and F/A programs are well-funded. Overall, our bid and proposal activity remains high, our win rates are solid and our order rates \u2013 our orders and backlog continue to grow, setting us up for accelerating growth in 2019 and in the medium-term as we execute against our strategic priorities and deliver shareholder value. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much and good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Bill, maybe if you could talk a little bit about I think overall the boost in the budget was much higher than expected and a lot of it comes in areas that should be attractive for Harris. And so, when you think about the framework for growth, kind of the multi-year framework that you guys outlined, is it possible at this time to think about how much acceleration there might be relative to that framework? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, Seth, thanks for the question. For us and for everybody in the space, the budget was very positive as I mentioned in my remarks. Tactical radio is pretty good. We see additional aircraft quantities and we're very encouraged about the trend line on the intelligence budgets, including the areas that we've been able to stake a position like in smallsats. So, we're very encouraged by that. At the beginning of the year, we set out a framework which showed mid-single-digit growth across the medium-term and while we're not providing any guidance today, I see it today being incrementally better than when we started the year. And you could see that in sort of the trend lines based on what we've seen over the course of our fiscal 2018. In CS, we started the year at 3% to 5%. We went to 5% to 7%. Now, we're in a 7% to 7.5% range. DoD Tactical, we started the beginning of the year at mid-teens. We went to 20% growth year-over-year. Now, we're about 30%. We're seeing much greater traction in the Electronic Warfare in Avionics segments. So, when I sit and look at it, it feels better incrementally than it did before, so maybe mid-single-digit-plus in 2019 and beyond. Clearly, the CS segment, we said was at the time I think mid-single digits is probably mid to high. I think Electronic Systems was mid to high and it's probably at the high end of that. And I would say also on the Space and Intel business, which we were thinking was low to mid-single-digit growth at the beginning of the year, feels closer to mid-single-digit growth principally because of getting the traction in smallsats, as well as the very significant win that we recently received on an exquisite payload. So, that all is very encouraging and I see us being a bit incrementally better in 2019 and beyond than we thought at the beginning of the year. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. That's great color. And, Rahul, if we ended the year today, what would happen to the pension income in fiscal 2019? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So, for every 25 basis points of increase in rates, it reduces our pension income by about $8 million to $10 million. And the 10-year is up about 50 basis points since we set the rates in June. So, there is some headwind from increase in rates. However, we did make a voluntary contribution of $300 million to our pension fund that will generate 7.75% rate of return and it should also reduce our PBGC premiums. So, while the increase in rates will be a headwind, we should be able to manage through that and the benefits of incremental contributions will more than offset it. But it will all depend on where the rates are as of June 30, but we don't see any year-over-year change in our pension income at this point. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Bill, the Army has been restructuring its network and I'm wondering if you can talk about on a forward basis, I'm talking beyond the existing business, the radios and so forth, but what interactions Harris is taking with the Network Cross-Functional Team at the Army? What kind of IRAD investments are you making? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's a good question, Rob. We're very tightly partnered with the Army and have been for quite some time. As you know, they're forming this Futures Command. There's fixed investment modernization priorities, or eight CFTs, or cross-functional teams, one of which is on the Army network. We're very closely linked to them. They've been to our facilities. We have detailed conversations with them and they help us think through how we can invest our IRAD spend both on radio but probably more importantly on next-generation waveforms that are low probability of intercept, low probability of detection, anti-jam waveforms that can operate effectively in contested environment. So, we're very tightly linked with them. As you know, they've decided to separate the decisions around the upper Tactical network, which is around WIN-T \u2013 we've got a radio and a waveform that's positioned there \u2013 from the lower Tactical, which is around the radios. And I'm very pleased to see them moving forward and placing orders for the Manpack. They're moving forward on the handheld. I think this is all very, very encouraging. So, long way of saying we're very tightly connected and I think we continue to adjust and adapt our strategy and our investments, given where the Army happens to be moving. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Do you see the competitive environment changing here? Are any of your competitors withdrawing perhaps, giving you essentially an opportunity for a larger share of everything? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it is shifting around. I mean, through the JTRS program, we had one of our large competitors in the space dropped out. One of their partners has a particular role on a program. There's another that's a competitor on the low end radio or the handheld radio. We're sole source on a SOCOM opportunity. There's different players that are evolving and developing unique waveforms that are getting some traction in certain parts of the DoD community. So, yeah, it's shifting around, but I feel really good about our competitive position. We've been able to sustain high share in this area and high margins in this area. Despite these shifts that are occurring across the services between DoD and International with some new competitors in, older competitors out, I think we continue to kind of keep the course and invest heavily and I think we'll end up continuing to be successful in this area. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then just \u2013 this is a little bit based on Seth's question a moment ago, high level question. But given the budget environment and the fact that we've got a pretty clear look at the \u2013 given 2018 and the 2019 budget, how do you think about industry growth for defense for the next, call it, three years? Is there an average kind of top line growth number we could think about? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I really don't think about what the average industry growth is because everybody individually is going to be affected in a different way. Harris, even within Harris, we've got some shorter cycle and some longer cycle businesses. But I think overall, it's going to be positive. The budget trends are clearly up, at least for the next several years. It all depends on how fast the appropriations get flowed down into contracts and awarded to companies and how fast they can execute on it. So, there's lots of dimensions here that are going to drive top line growth, including making sure that all the things you need to provide to satisfy that contract, the supply chain, your own asset structure, your own employment, all needs to adapt to a much better budget environment. But, I think overall, it's clearly a positive sign and most companies, including Harris, would be up in the mid-single-digit-plus range 2019 and beyond. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Bill, wanted to ask you about CS margins. You had a little bit of year-over-year improvement, nice sequential improvement. It looks like in Q4, despite forecasting higher revenues year-over-year, you're guiding to down margin. Just if you could walk through the different moving pieces there and how it might set up for margins in 2019 on the growth that you're talking about? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So, David, this is Rahul. So, the margins for CS, we've \u2013 it's been really good year-to-date. Last year, we were at 29.1% through the first three quarters. This year, we are at 29.6%, so up 50 basis points, and so really strong growth year-to-date. And there is typically a step up in the fourth quarter on the margin side in Communication Systems. And we \u2013 last year \u2013 this year, the same thing we are expecting a slight step up from where we are year-to-date and that's going to come from increased volume and some mix shift of products. So, we feel good about the approximately 30% that we've kind of guided to this year. Now, going forward, there are a few things that will drive CS margins. But, overall, we feel that we can stay around the 30% range. There should be benefit from higher volume and as that drops through the factory, but the modernization products are coming with slightly lower margin and there is \u2013 all the system wins that we're getting, we also typically come in at less than the product gross margins. So, you put that all together and we feel that 30% is a sustainable rate for this segment. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And any update on where you are in terms of the capacity utilization in Rochester? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Sure. Our capacity utilization is around 60% in the factory right now. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And, Rahul, a follow-up on working capital. So, you've had some working capital growth this year, but below the level of your sales growth. How are you thinking about working capital from here, either as a percentage of sales or days working capital? Where do you think that can get to? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah. So, we've done well with working capital, David. I mean, when we bought Exelis, Harris was around mid-40s. Exelis was well north of 80% or whatever \u2013 sorry, 80 days. And so combined, we were probably in the 60ish range \u2013 60 days range. So, last year we ended at about 43 days and that was six days lower than where we ended fiscal 2016. So, we've shown sequentially better working capital improvement. And this year, we're targeting about a two-day improvement in working capital. So, we think we'll end at around 41 days. The opportunity for us going forward is around two areas. One, advance payments. Our advance payments are typically much lower than industry average. So, we see there's an opportunity to improve that and reducing our inventory. We've done well so far, but there are incremental opportunities. So, it's not going to be \u2013 we're not going to see another six-day reduction, but there is an opportunity to bring that down under a couple of days over the next two to three years. So, we'll keep making progress on working capital. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Bill, should it be in my scenario analysis, not my base case, but in my range of potential outcomes of what is spinning out of my model that total company organic revenue growth next year is 10%? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: That's certainly not what we're guiding to today. We're not providing guidance to 2019. But, again, it all comes down to how fast the budget plus-ups that we've seen and the higher budget in 2018 flows onto contract vehicles. We have seen very fortunately the Army move a little bit faster than we had expected on the HMS Manpack. Receiving the delivery order this week was a good positive. I think they were indicating previously it would be perhaps mid-summer. So, they're moving faster on that. That will deliver in 2019. That's a good sign. But, I think it all comes down to how fast money can flow into contract vehicles and then how fast we can execute on that. So, there's a scenario out there that gets you higher than we are at today at mid-single-digit-plus in next year. But, we'll tell you more about that once we close our fourth quarter at the end of June and provide some guidance in late July or early August. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. With ES being up 10% organically in the quarter, but you're simultaneously spending some incremental R&D there, making some new investments there, is there a correlation between that growth rate and the investments or is the growth rate today from business already secured and the investments you are making now are hoping to win you more new business beyond today? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I mean, they don't correlate on a day-to-day or month-to-month basis. But clearly, the investments we've made over the last few years in a couple of areas, certainly, in Electronic Warfare, we've talked about that to quite some extent, is really paying a lot of dividends as well as investments in a variety of technologies in the Avionics side, especially in open mission systems, and that's paying some dividends. We're sort of starting to see that flow through in the order raised and the revenue in Avionics and Electronic Warfare and I would expect as we continue to invest that we've stepped up very recently again, even from where we were before in investments in these areas and I think that will help us in 2019 and beyond. There's also some new franchise we are investing in that includes robotics. We've seen some \u2013 a very important win. That contract in UK is executing and we see a lot of opportunities to grow from that. So, there is a correlation between the step up in the investments we've made over the last few years in IRAD and the growth rates today, but I'd say what we're spending on today is going to help us in 2019 and beyond. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, just one more on the International piece of Tactical radio in Comm Systems. Your tone maybe sounded a little more positive there speaking to what the backlogs are. And I know, you talked about that being flat to down this year and then, I think maybe refresh my memory, but I think, you've kind of said maybe flat to maybe even down slightly again next year just because you had the European recap that takes more than a year to normalize. But, are you now thinking International can grow in 2019 or what's the latest view there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I mean, again, we haven't given any guidance in 2019, but there are certain things that we're looking at that would indicate that the International business can grow modestly in 2019. Right now, in fiscal 2018, we are still guiding to flat to maybe down slightly. That implies a growth quarter in Q4. What we have seen this year different than last year and the prior years is less lumpiness. It's more level loaded and even loaded across the quarters, which is good. We always see Q4 being a bit stronger than the others, but a little more even loaded. Our pipeline, despite the good order rate that we've seen so far this year, our pipeline remains very robust at about $2.3 billion. It's about the same as has been every quarter over the last year practically. So, even though the orders are coming up, the pipeline is replenishing itself relatively quickly and we feel good about the position that we happen to have. So, I think we'll deliver Q4 and as we get into 2019, we'll give you a little bit more guidance on that. But, I don't see a step down in fiscal 2019 International. If anything, it will be probably slightly up. Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, thanks, guys. I was wondering if you could expand on David's question about margin just in a growth environment you're talking about some potential acceleration in each segment. How do you think about mix, R&D spending investments in each segment going forward? We understand that CS stays around 30%, but how about the other two? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I mean, I think, we're looking at margins being about flat in the next year or so in each of the segments, so CS around 30% and the others about where we happen to be guiding to in fiscal 2018. But, as I \u2013 my comments on mid-single-digit growth plus over the near-term, clearly, CS and ES are going to be growing a little bit faster than the Space and Intelligence business. So, the businesses with slightly higher margins and higher margins certainly in the CS side will grow faster, so there's a company level going into 2019 and beyond just because of the mix across the franchise, across the company, we could see some margin growth at Harris overall in 2019 and beyond. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. And do you care to update us on just thinking about multi-year free cash flow targets in terms of dollars in light of again better budgets or some of the working capital opportunities you've highlighted? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So, our guidance this year, the revised guidance is about $900 million to $925 million. So, to get on these kind of \u2013 we see a path to get to $1 billion next year and that's $85 million to $90 million, several puts and takes. About tax reform, it's probably half of that growth. So, we got \u2013 since we are a fiscal year company, kind of June fiscal year, we got half of benefit of tax reform this year, the remaining benefit is coming next year. So, there is a tax reform benefit next year. And then, we have about $15 million to $20 million of cash outflow from Exelis integration in fiscal 2018. That should wind down by 2019 and there will be incremental benefit from increased earnings. So, there is a clear line of sight to getting to $1 billion by 2019. And then, beyond that where cash flow should grow with earnings, there is \u2013 we do see opportunities on working capital improvement and we'll deal with that when we get there in terms of how that all mix changes between revenue growth and working capital. But, we see line of sight to $1 billion next year and then grow through the earnings beyond that. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Rahul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: I was hoping you could expand upon your comments on the pipeline. You mentioned the $2.3 billion in the foreign side Tactical RF. What are the big opportunities, if you could maybe give us an update on Australia? Is it still $60 million of revenue this year, ramping next year and the year after? Maybe just give us some perspective on big campaigns that are underway by region or by country? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, I mean, I'll start on that and maybe Rahul can jump in. Yeah, so the International Tactical pipeline is around $2.3 billion and again it's about where it's been over the last number of quarters and I think it's good news that despite the orders, it's holding relatively stable. About 55% of that is in Middle East and Africa and that's a little higher than it was last quarter. So, we continue to see opportunities flowing into the pipeline in the Middle East as we've talked about Iraq in the past. Iraq is a very big important opportunity. It's well funded. There's lots of opportunities for us to grow in Iraq. We see opportunities in Kuwait, some opportunities evolving in Saudi Arabia, in the UAE especially as we continue to execute well on the Emirates Land Tactical System, the network system that we're installing there which is going to be going through an IOC very, very soon, hitting a key milestone. So, we see good opportunities continuing in the Middle East. Europe is about 20%, more or less, of the pipeline. Again, we continue to see opportunities in the Ukraine that looks fairly, fairly good as well as other NATO countries. And we're starting to see more opportunities in Western Europe evolve in Europe as well. In Asia, that's about 10% of the pipeline. So, Australia is a key part of what we're executing there. That $260 million systems opportunity is going well. It's about that revenue opportunity in fiscal 2018. It will grow in 2019 and 2020 as we continue to work and complete that program. It's going well so far with the front end, but going well. But there's a lot of follow-on opportunities in Australia as we execute well on that particular program. So, I'm very encouraged about what's happening in the Asia Pacific region. And importantly as we develop more and more credibility around installing network systems, which is a much bigger market for us, and I went through a couple of the examples of what we've done in the past and what we're working on today, including another opportunity in a Southeast Asian country that was just awarded to us in terms of a systems modernization that builds on a legacy installed base. So, those are the major opportunities. Central Latin America is about 10% of the pipeline. It depends on what we see happening in Colombia and Mexico. Last year was a very good year for Mexico. This year is a bit softer. But we do expect to continue to see recapitalizations there. And then Central Asia, which is Afghanistan, Pakistan, is a small piece of the pipeline, very small piece of our revenue this year. It could start to grow over time. I'm not looking at that being a growth market for us in fiscal 2019. So, maybe that's a little bit of color on the International side. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Yeah. That's very helpful. And could you give us an update on the DoD Tactical? Last time, I think the pipeline was about $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Is it the same and... William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, it's about the same, Gautam. It's about $1.5 billion with just over $1 billion in what we call base. So, that would be readiness and resets. HF radios will be in the base and there's some opportunities on HF. And then the balance would be modernization. So, that's the HMS program, SOCOM, some opportunities for the radio for the WIN-T system. That's a bit higher than where it was last quarter, as you'd expect. As we march off in time, more and more of the modernization opportunities will come into the pipeline, certainly that's indicated in the budget as well. So, again, about $1.5 billion for DoD and consistent with where we've been. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: And, Bill, you've done a admirable job since you've become CEO. Company is in a much better position, cycle's helping, et cetera. I was just curious, your cash redeployment historically has been for share repurchase and debt repayment. When you think about the next five years, is M&A going to be a bigger part of the story or how do you think about where you want to take the portfolio over time? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. Look, I think our portfolio is in really, really good shape and you can see it through the solid execution over the last number of quarters. We've got very strong businesses, very strong franchises, good share. We invested very aggressively in IRAD over the last five years. Even in a difficult sequestered market, we invested in IRAD. And a lot of the things that we're talking about today as great opportunities and how well positioned come from a lot of those strategic investments. When the market was really soft, we executed on the Exelis transaction. We integrated very, very well, and I think it's positioned us, helped us reshape the portfolio as well. So, sitting here today, we're going to generate a lot of cash in the next couple of years, sort of north of $2 billion of cash in the next few years, less than $1 billion of that will be for dividends and a little bit of debt next year. So, it leaves a lot of capacity for either M&A or to buy back our stock as we continue to see value in our stock both this quarter as well as going into next year. We think there's value remains in Harris stock. So, we're going to be thinking hard about this. We think that there is opportunity to continue to do M&A. That will happen over time. I think that's going to be a key part of our long-term strategy. But, I don't see us diverting from the core business franchise that we're in today, Gautam. I see us continue to bolster the business that we're in today, which again, are performing exceptionally well. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks a lot. Good luck, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Bill, I wondered if you could expand a little bit on the commentary around the expansion in the opportunity pipeline and the adjacencies you highlighted, just maybe some insight into the color on that expansion and what opportunities it might have both on the R&D front or the M&A front or the CapEx front to go capture some of that. Just an understanding of what the next leg might be in terms of how you expand what you've already done. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. I mean, as I see this, there's adjacency opportunities really across the businesses and I spoke a little bit about it in the Tactical side, as we move from a large player with high share in the ground Tactical network, ground side to continuing to grow, leveraging the platform investments we made for DoD and selling them into the International market. That's been a proven strategy. It's worked very, very well. And it's why we've got a very high share even of the International markets we play in, where they're not restricted markets. And we've laid out a very clear strategy to investors of taking that solid base and opening up the addressable market, so going more into network systems. So, where we have the radio packaging systems around that to make it easier to use and more intelligent to the end users like Australia, like we've done in the UAE and other places as well as get a systems opportunity in markets where maybe we don't have the incumbent radio position and use that as a way to go in and pull the radio that \u2013 maybe with another competitor into Harris. So, that's been a clear direction that we've been on as well as take our great position on ground radios into the airborne side and clearly the ARC-201 product from Exelis allows it to go into that particular market as well as airborne ISR. And again, this is a very important win that we just received in the last week, this $130 million IDIQ. I think it is testament to the capabilities that we have across these different domain. And, Carter, these are areas that we've been investing in IRAD in over the last couple of years. So, I don't see a big step up from here to go and penetrate these domains. I see it a continuation of the investments we have been making. The other thing we've talked quite a bit about is some of the adjacencies that we're attacking in the intelligence community. We've talked about moving over time from being a component supplier to supplying subsystems to now supplying complete end-to-end mission solutions, like we've done on smallsat. That has been a significant investment on our part. Our IRAD investment in our Space and Intelligence business has crept up over time and it really is going after those kinds of opportunities. You're winning this $0.5 billion exquisite system that we just won in the last couple of weeks, which really shows the power of the model we have in our Space and Intelligence business to both go after new end-to-end mission solutions as a prime, but also be the partner of choice for components and subsystems for large exquisite systems. So, I think this balance is working very, very well for us, and as I see going forward, I see our IRAD in the same range we're in today as a percentage of revenue, could take up a little bit, but not materially. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : That's great color. Thank you, sir. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Carter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Pete. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : So, let me start with the F-35, just we seem to be reading more and more about cost pressures on suppliers for the F-35. Just wondering if that's impacting you guys at all yet, and/or do you still see an opportunity to expand your content there? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, both actually. I think we are a pretty significant player on the F-35. I think we're in the top 15. We have about $2.2 million worth of content per ship set on F-35 and we see that growing perhaps over time with some of the recent wins and a few things that we're working on the open mission system computer. So, we do see cost pressure and I think we've been performing exceptionally well. Our job really is to continue to add capabilities and continue to take cost out. And when you look at the performance of the company, we're more than 99.5% on time for over 1 million components that we've delivered to date on the F-35. So, we're a very good supplier there. We've reduced cost by more than two-thirds from the first shipset on F-35. So, I think we've demonstrated capability and willingness to work hard to continue to take cost out. As the customer and our partners are moving to block buys, it'll help us continue to take cost out and as we move to open systems, there's lots of opportunities to both gain share and drive a more affordable aircraft for Lockheed and the end customers. So, it's all embedded in our numbers and it's all part of what we've been doing for the last decade or more as we've worked on F-35. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Okay. That's great. And just last one from me. On Army radios, I think this will be characterized under (50:52) maybe, but a couple of programs I think in terms of demand for you. One, this whole creation of the Army Security Force Assistance Brigades. And then the other question MUOS back-fit and my question for both of those is really how much kind of incremental demand have those two programs driven for you? How much longer will they last? I'm just wondering kind of on the timeline, how far along we are in those two opportunities. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, Pete, both. Our readiness to manage both Army and Air Force this year and it's about $100 million, maybe just a tad above $100 million. Roughly half of that is the Army and it's outfitting two SFABs. There's two Security Forces Assistance Brigades in our fiscal 2018. Not all of the content was Harris. There was content from other players, but as was about half of that $100 million, $105 million. As we go into next year, I think the DoD has to outfit another four SFABs in the Army and then they'll decide exactly when that will be out of the mix of radio products. It's going to be legacy, it's going to be new product and all of that's being worked. But, it looks like it'll be an opportunity for us in 2019 or 2020 based on what we're hearing from the Army in terms of outfitting additional SFABs. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. And then the MUOS back-fit, are we done with the MUOS back-fit or more to go on that? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah. MUOS is going very well. In fact, as you know, we have a MUOS capability in our 117G. We've been selling that capability as software upgrades to the Marine Corps, to SOCOM, to the Air Force. It is a threshold requirement for the Army new radio. So, one of the reasons why we've had to deliver 100 test radios to the Army for this Field-based Risk Reduction that's occurring imminently, really is to validate not just other things, but including MUOS capability in the new generation of Army radios, and again, we'll clearly be able to achieve that and develop success on that this summer and that allows that fielding to happen into next year. So, for us, MUOS has been a good story both on thriving it back in the legacy radios, but also embedding into the new ones. Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thanks very much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Pete. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Just a couple of technical follow-up questions from me. First of all, your thoughts on the capital structure going forward. What's your latest on what we can expect in terms of debt repayments or refinancing over the next couple of years? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, let me start with this. I think we paid $550 million of debt in the month of April. So, that's it for fiscal 2018. We've borrowed $300 million in a floating rate note to fund the pension that we do in the year. We'll pay that in 2019. Beyond that, we don't see any further debt repayment. Any debt that's due will likely be refinanced. We'll hit down to low 2s to 2 times to 3 times leverage by the end of this year and then even lower next year and we feel very confident and comfortable with where our debt structure happens to be in our credit ratings. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then, secondly on the tax, there's been a lot of stuff moving around this year. What do you expect any sort of steady run rate going forward in 2019 and beyond? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: So right now, Rob, what we're thinking is around 18% for next year. Again, part of that coming from a step down in getting half of the year of tax reform and some of the other tax planning work that we've been doing and I think that 18% is kind of sustainable going forward. So, we see another step down from 22.5% this year to 18% and that we feel is kind of sustainable rate going forward. Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great. Okay, thanks so much. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Thank you. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call this morning and please do not hesitate to get in touch with me for any additional questions. Have a great day, everyone. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Discussions today will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available. With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. We ended fiscal 2018 on a high note with fourth quarter earnings per share up 19% on revenue growth of 8%, the highest top-line growth we've seen in seven years. Revenue was once again up in all segments and operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 19.6%. For the year, earnings per share was up 18% to $6.50 on 5% revenue growth and we generated record free cash flow of $915 million, 116% of net income. Orders were up 18% and increased by double-digits for the fifth consecutive quarter, ending the year up 23% with a book-to-bill of 1.2, and backlog up 26%. All driven by our multi-year investment and innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates, and an improving budget environment. Rahul will walk through the details of the quarter and full-year financial results. But I want to take a moment to just recap the highlights of the year on slide 4. Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 9% from strength in DoD Tactical and Night Vision. DoD Tactical revenue was up 46% in the quarter and 35% for the year driven by more than $100 million of readiness demand from the Army and the Air Force to support deployment of security forces overseas, with upgraded software-defined-radios. Order momentum was even stronger up 81% for the year to support readiness and the ramp of modernization programs. Notable wins include the first LRIP order for the Army HMS Manpack. Additional orders from the Marine Corps for Manpack radios with MUOS capability, and a $765 million sole-source IDIQ for Navy and Marine Corps Falcon III and next-gen radios, double the previous contract and aligned with the budget request for Marine Corps modernization efforts over the next few years. We were also awarded a sole-source five year $130 million IDIQ by the Air Force to develop and produce a handheld video data link radio to provide airborne collected ISR information to forces on the ground, representing the successful execution of our strategy to penetrate adjacent markets like Tactical ISR. International Tactical also performed well, with revenue up 10% for the quarter and down less than 1% for the year, as increased demand in the Middle East and Africa to support counter-terrorism activity, and the ramp of the Australian modernization program in the Asia-Pacific region offset the expected decline in Eastern Europe. International orders were up 25% in the year, which combined with a robust and diverse pipeline gives us confidence that international will return to growth in fiscal 2019. Overall for the year, Tactical ended the year stronger than we first expected with revenue up 11%, orders up 41% and backlog up 82% to about $900 million. Giving us confidence and continued growth in Tactical and the broader CS segment in fiscal 2019 and beyond. In Electronic Systems, after a flattish first half due to the ADS-B transition, second half revenue growth accelerated to 9%, with growth across all ES businesses and ending the year above the high end of our 5% guidance range. The key driver with long-term platforms like the F-35, F-18, and F-16 which collectively grew by more than 20% as a result of technology upgrades, ramped production, and increased content. Two international programs; UK Robotics and the UAE Battle Management also contributed to strong year-over-year growth in ES. Segment orders increased 33% to $3.1 billion with more than \u2013 and more than doubled to over a $1 billion on the F-35, the F-18 and the F-16 platforms. In June, we were awarded by a $400 million sole-source IDIQ to supply Electronic Warfare Systems for international F-16s. That's a key gating item as we work towards capturing an estimated $1.5 billion opportunity. On the F-18, we had our best orders year on record, and we received two awards totaling $320 million to supply electronic jammers to protect U.S. in international F18s against electronic threats, supporting multi-year growth on this important platform. We continue to make progress on the international pursuits, successfully delivering our first two robotic systems for Explosive Ordnance Disposal missions to the UK MOD. Achieving this milestone is important as we pursue other international opportunities in the upcoming U.S. DoD Common Robotic System Competition. We also leveraged our FAA managed services model to capture a 15-year $141 million contract in the quarter to modernize India's air traffic management communications infrastructure, supporting growth in one of the world's largest aviation markets. Overall for Electronic Systems, book-to-bill was 1.3 for the year and backlog increased 30% to $2.6 billion. This combined with the $17 billion pipeline and $4.5 billion in proposals outstanding, gives us confidence that revenue will continue to accelerate in fiscal 2019. In Space and Intel, revenue was up 1% for the year as growth in Classified programs from the ramp of smallsats, ground-based adjacencies and Space surveillance programs, offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. Investments in R&D and innovation ahead of the customer needs, resulted in double-digit growth in Classified orders for the year as we strengthen our global leadership in hosted payloads, increased our share of wallet with existing customers, and expanded our addressable market from components to now full-mission solutions. Orders for the segment grew 6% and book-to-bill was slightly greater than 1% for the year. With about 80% of fiscal 2019 revenue and backlog and high confidence, follow-on opportunities, a $14 billion pipeline, continued strength in Classified Space, and decreasing headwinds on our environmental programs, we now expect mid-single digit growth for the segment in fiscal 2019. We continue to maintain best-in-class margins and generate a record free cash flow of $915 million, returning about $550 million to shareholders. We also achieved our post-Exelis debt reduction commitment of $2 billion, and pre-funded our pension plan to about 90%, with no required contributions until 2025, creating future cash flow flexibility. But our strong operation performance wouldn't be possible without a relentless focus on operational excellence. It's a program we call Harris Business Excellence or HBX. HBX is integral part of the Harris culture of continuous improvement and it's contributed to successes across the enterprise. For example, the Night Vision over the last two years, we've improved yield and on-time delivery while lowering cost, resulting in significant margin expansion and double-digit growth. This business has moved from being a watch area, when we acquired Exelis to a growth driver. And the improved returns, give us the room to increase investment to compete on upcoming U.S. and international modernization programs. On the F-35 program, we've delivered over a million parts with greater than 99.95% on-time delivery and we've received the Outstanding Supplier Award in our weapons release factory in Amityville. Operational performance and a commitment to innovation has driven increased content per shipset with opportunities to expand it further in the future. And on the F-18, IDECM program to franchise with more than a $1 billion in orders to date, we've cut factory cycle time by 10% and have been recognized by the Navy for maintaining a 100% on-time delivery record over the past 20 years. In Space and Intel you've heard me speak about improved execution on the SENSOR program and we continue to make progress, with on-time delivery increasing from 35% when we acquired Exelis to 90% today, driving 15% revenue growth on the program just this past year. And finally, on GPS III, we've corrected the legacy issues and established a proven and reliable production cadence, delivering the fifth payload in March with numbers 6 through 8 expected by early next year. And now with a recently developed fully digital Mission Data Unit, we're well-positioned for the upcoming GPS IIIF award and maintaining incumbency. Overall, we've had an exceptional year, in which we returned to growth and generated record earnings per share and free cash flow, meeting or exceeding the targets we set for ourselves. For fiscal 2019, we expect to build on that momentum and continue our strong performance, accelerating growth in all three segments, increasing margins and maximizing cash. For the year, we expect earnings per share of $7.65 to $7.85 on revenue growth of 6% to 8% and to achieve our $1 billion free cash flow goal. Let me now turn it over to Rahul to walk through our financial results and additional details on fiscal 2019 guidance, before I close with a few comments on our medium-term outlook. Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Starting with total company results on slide 5. As a reminder, discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude one-time adjustments. Revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter and operating income increased 11% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 50 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19%, or $0.29, and excluding the benefit of tax reform was up 12%, or $0.18. Free cash flow was a record $464 million for the quarter. Turning to the full-year EPS bridge on slide 6. EPS grew by 18%, or $0.97. The expected $0.21 headwind from the ADS-B program transition was offset by disciplined capital deployment. Half of the EPS growth was from higher volume in Tactical Communications, Avionics, and Classified Space, solid program execution, productivity and higher pension income offset by lower environmental volume and program mix. The other half came from a lower tax rate including the benefit from tax reform. On slide 7, Communication Systems' revenue in the quarter was $523 million, up 16% versus the prior year with growth across all the three businesses in the segment. In addition to the strong growth of 21% in Tactical, Night Vision revenue was again up double-digits as the business continued to improve execution. Operating income for the segment was up 11% to $162 million from higher volume and operational efficiencies. Operating margin remained strong at 31% and orders were up 6%, growing for the eighth consecutive quarter. For the full-year, revenue and operating income each increased 9% with operating margin of 30%. Segment orders increased 28%, book-to-bill was 1.3x, and greater than 1x in each of the three businesses in the segment. We continue to include historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog as supplemental information at the end of the presentation. On slide 8, Electronic Systems' revenue was $640 million, up 8% for the quarter, driven by growth in Avionics, Electronic Warfare, and C4ISR. Segment operating income increased 14% to $119 million from higher volume and strong operational performance. Orders grew double-digits for the fifth straight quarter, up 38% with a book-to-bill of 1.3x. For the full year, segment revenue was up 5%, and operating margin was at 18.6%, as operational efficiencies partially offset the negative impact of the ADS-B program transition, incremental investment, and shift in program revenue mix. On slide 9, in Space and Intelligence, revenue for the fourth quarter was up 0.4% and operating income was up 8% as margins expanded 110 basis points from strong program execution and higher pension income. For the full-year, revenue was up 1% as continued growth in Classified programs was partially offset by an expected decline in the environmental program revenue. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 17.5%. Switching to guidance for fiscal 2019. We have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 using the full retrospective method, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Adopting the new standard requires adjusting the timing of recognition of revenue and associated program cost for a few contract, treatment of certain expenses, but does not materially impact our total financial results. Our guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standard and the preliminary re-casted historical financials are included as supplemental information on slide 16. For fiscal 2019, revenue is expected to be up 6% to 8% over the re-casted fiscal 2018 base, which is $11 million lower than the reported numbers. So not a material impact. The growth in the year has driven by continued DoD Tactical modernization, as well as growth across Electronic Warfare, Avionics, Battle Management and Classified Space Programs. We expect total company EBIT margins to be between 19.3% and 19.7% from strong growth in higher margin Communications Systems and Electronic Systems segments. Fiscal 2019 EPS is expected to be between $7.65 and $7.85 and includes a placeholder of $400 million for share repurchases and an effective tax rate of 17%. We expect to generate greater than or equal to $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2019, reflecting higher earnings and cash tax benefit from pension prefunding, partially offset by increased working capital, higher capital expenditures, and the timing of tax payments. We ended fiscal 2018 with working capital of 42 days, a one day improvement over 2017 and 2019 guidance reflects continued improvement in working capital performance. Capital expenditures grew by approximately $35 million to $170 million to support new program starts. We are expecting accelerated growth in each of the segments in fiscal 2019. Communications Systems revenue is expected to be up between 8% and 10%. With DoD Tactical up mid to high teens, Night Vision, up double-digits and International Tactical and Public Safety up low to mid-single digits. Modernization growth in DoD Tactical will primarily occur in the second half of the fiscal year as we start to ship Manpacks for the Army and ramp-up production and deliveries of handhelds with SOCOM and the Army. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 29.5% and 30.5%, reflecting the dilutive margin impact of new program starts and incremental systems work that is more than offset by the benefits from operational excellence and fixed cost leverage from higher volume in the Rochester factory. Electronic Systems' revenue is expected to be up between 7% and 8%, driven by strong growth in Avionics and Electronic Warfare as fiscal 2018 backlog converts to revenue, and the continued ramp of UAE Battle Management program. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 18% and 19% as growth from lower margin program is offset by operational excellence. In Space and Intelligence, revenue is expected to be up between 4% and 5%. Classified business representing about two-thirds of the segment is expected to grow high-single digits, partially offset by continued modest weakness in environmental programs, which we expect to reach a trough this fiscal year. Segment operating margin is expected to be between 17% and 18%, reflecting the volume increase and operational efficiencies. Fiscal 2019 EPS bridge on slide 11. EPS is expected to grow between $1.15 and $1.35 from higher volume across the three segments; operational efficiencies, lower tax rate including the benefit of tax reform and accretive capital deployment. And with that, let me turn it back to Bill for closing remarks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, Rahul. I want to close with a few comments on our multi-year strategy, including the growth outlook for the medium-term. As we recap on slide 12, in recent years we reshaped our portfolio to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses, successfully integrated Exelis, and made disciplined investments in the business that led to several new product launches and strategic program wins. We also de-risked the balance sheet to give us more financial flexibility. Fiscal 2018 was an inflection point for Harris as we returned to growth and grew backlog significantly. This combined with a more favorable budget environment, especially in strategic growth areas, positions us well to accelerate growth in fiscal 2019 in the medium-term. At this time last year, I laid out the medium-term growth drivers by segment that is shown on slide 14, and over the past year we've seen the outlook improve in each of them. Communication and Electronic Systems are now expected to grow high-single digits and Space and Intel at mid-single digits, the higher end of the medium-term range for all three segments that we indicated this time last year. In Tactical, we're beginning to see the DoD modernization ramp across all the services, and International has stabilized and is returning to growth as we leverage our incumbency and large installed base and benefit from higher defense spending by coalition partners. In Electronic Systems, Avionics and Electronic Warfare are entering a multi-year growth cycle, driven by our position in long-term platforms. And in Space in Intel, Classified growth will accelerate as we maintain high win rates and expand into adjacencies in a growing budgeted environment and the headwinds in the environmental business now become tailwinds. We've been on a multi-year journey to improve margins. And while we made progress in driving productivity and efficiency in recent years, I see much more opportunity in front of us. We're now halfway through standardizing our systems that will reduce the number of ERP platforms from 28 to 3, simplifying our operating environment, driving productivity through growth and shared services, automating core processes, and laying the foundation of our enterprise-wide digital strategy. By the end of this year, we will have eliminated 80% of our data centers. And by fiscal 2021, the remainder will be fully cloud enabled. We recently hired a new Chief Technology Officer who is fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of every R&D dollar we invest. We're fully deploying DevOps to streamline software development, which is going to be more than 40% of our engineering work today, and is expected to increase over time. And we continue to squeeze more cost savings out of our supply-chain through value engineering and should cost analysis on new products, and improving supplier performance and reducing sole-source components on legacy solutions. Taken together, this relentless focus on operational excellence combined with the leverage on incremental volume that will drive margin expansion in Communication and Electronic Systems as well as for Harris as a whole. In summary, we expect higher revenue, higher margin, double-digit earnings per share growth, and sustained cash generation through the medium-term. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Rob. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I just had a couple of program-related questions. First, on the ES segment, the midpoint of your margin guidance would be flattish with 2018. And I think you call out some lower-margin programs perhaps being offset by operational improvement. What are some of these lower-margin programs, or the mix shift that you see here? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I think, first I'd say on 2018, we ended the year at 19.2% and we were guiding to 19.3% to 19.7%. So, at the center point we're up about 30 basis points before the Rev Rec goes in place, it's 50 basis points including revenue recognition. But as we've seen growth in our segments, especially in our Space, in environmental, in our Electronic Systems' business, some new wins like a Classified business is coming in at a lower than average segment margins and that's growing pretty healthily, and that will bring down the SIS segment a little bit, again offset by operational excellence. And of course, over in the Communication Systems segment and Tactical, as we see the ramp of modernization programs, as we've said before on this call, we'll see those programs coming at slightly lower than segment or normal Tactical margins, but improving over time as we continue to take costs out of the products, as we've done many times in the past. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And on F-35, you talked a little bit about higher content as one of the drivers there. Lockheed's been doing some things with the suppliers in order to pursue lower costs and better value, at least on things that are not life of program. Are there further opportunities or risks for your packages on the aircraft? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You know, Rob, we see more opportunities than risk, so there are some risks that remain today. We're about $2.2 million per shipset. Either we provide the mat (26:09) or we provide the common components. We have the bomb-release system, the carriage-release system. We recently won, over the last year, the PCD EU as well as the Aircraft Memory System. You know one of the things that's coming up is the ICP, the Integrated Core Processor, or the Mission Processor and that'll be awarded probably sometime later on this year. We're one of three companies are in the hunt on that. And over time, I think, you've heard Lockheed talk about what they might do on the ICNI as well as on the EW platform. And given our progress so far on EW and the work we've done through software-defined EW, a big investment over the last several years, a small size, weight and power systems, really improvements in cognitive in the algorithms we have. You know we think we'll be a player there if they decide to move down the path and re-compete that. So, as I look at F-35, is both going to grow from a volume perspective, but I think net-net I see opportunities to increase our content per shipset over time. Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Dave. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Bill, you talked, I think, again about $4 billion in outstanding bids at ES. Could you just talk about, obviously, the big ones, the chunky ones and the timing around those when you would expect to hear on those? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, there's some \u2013 certainly a big piece of it is going to be some opportunities, we have with the FAA, which is a bridge contract on the FTI program. We should expect that over the next couple of months that's going to be an important one, but there's a lot of other activities including some of what I just mentioned on the F-35. There's opportunities on F-16. You know there's opportunities in the near-term pipeline on robotic systems, especially as we extend that platform beyond the UK into other international markets as well as U.S. DoD. So, it really goes across the gamut of what's in the Electronic Systems business. I don't know, if you have any other color, Rahul? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: The only other thing I would add to that Bill is, we've got \u2013 you know we've been talking about the UAE program, David, and a lots of bids that are outstanding to expand that program, further not only with the land forces, but even beyond that within the country. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: That was a $189 million program in the UAE and we're coming up very close to a mission readiness exercise in the next month or two which has gone, so far exceptionally well and as that goes well in the August-September timeframe, as well as point out, there's a big opportunity ahead of us in the UAE. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I mean, in terms of percentage, are you going to hear \u2013 on the $4 billion, would you hear 75% of that this year, or is \u2013 kind of ballpark how much are you, what percentage you expect to hear on this year? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: I think the bulk of it, we should hear on within the next year, yes. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. Bill, you outlined the potential for margin upside between volume and productivity and various other things. Currently, the businesses as a whole are running around 22%. Would you care to frame kind of the margin upside potential you're thinking about here? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Yeah, when I look at it \u2013 let me take it from the Harris-wide perspective, you're talking about the seg Op margin or segment EBIT margin. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: This year, we're going to be \u2013 again, center point of our guidance is 19.5%. So that's up on an average about 30 basis points over reported 2018, a little bit more than that when you look at the revenue recognition restatement in 2018. But if I go out in the 2019 \u2013 into fiscal 2020, I think we should be approaching, if not hitting 20%. So, we believe with the maturity of our operational excellence program, some of the actions, the steps we're taking today and the way we're going to take cost out of new product launches like in Tactical over the next 12 to 18 months, we're pretty confident of margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. David Strauss - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. It's Gavin on for Noah. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Gavin. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, having taken up the revenue guidance in all three of the segments, just kind of how should we think about how much visibility you have into that over the next few years? How much of that is already in backlog given you've had bookings well above revenue past few years or how much of that is contingent upon further budget growth? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: When we look at going into next year, again, we're guiding to 6% to 8% revenue growth. We ended the year with very strong backlog growth. And as I look into next year, Harris as a whole \u2013 and I'll really keep my comments specific to fiscal 2019, we have about two-thirds of our revenue that's covered either in backlog or in high probability follow-on opportunities, which is up from where we were last year. And it's up pretty substantially in the CS business, as well as the Space and Intel segment. So, we think just based on where the backlog is, the pipeline we have, the bids that are outstanding, I see more visibility on revenue in fiscal 2019 than we would say going into 2018 a year ago. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on the long-term outlook for Manpack, I'm just curious if you could update us on how much you think of the IDIQ might be exercised. Do you think you can get more than 50% share, and if so, what do you think your share could ultimately be on that program? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Look, we've been running historically over the last five to 10 years at a much higher share than 50%. So, we would aspire to have our fair share of that market, which would be more than 50%. Look, first of all, the funding lines for Tactical as a whole are actually quite strong. They're up in the fiscal 2019 NDAA from 2018, and 2018 was up about 17%, 20% from fiscal 2016, and they're growing to about $1 billion or $1.2 billion a year over the next several years. So, the funding that's supporting the overall Tactical business is very, very strong including the HMS Manpack. We're doing well. We had a delivery order, an LRIP delivery order for 1,129 units out of (32:31) delivery in fiscal 2019. We expect that we'll see another LRIP order probably in the back half of our fiscal 2019 of some size, leading into operational testing in fiscal 2020. So, it is all playing out, I think, very well. It's moving forward as we'd expected. The budget is there. The Army is moving the program. So, I think, it's all very good news on not just the Army Manpack, but really all the Tactical Radio programs as a whole. Gavin Parsons - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Hey, good morning, guys, and nice results again. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Carter. Thank you. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Bill, I wondered if you might expand a little bit on the \u2013 just the thought process around the R&D pipeline. Obviously, your IRAD investments have had a lot of payoff, a lot of attractive payoff in the last couple of years, and I just wonder if you think about the incremental dollars and opportunities that you have in that pipeline, is your thought process around these things changing? I mean, you've obviously had a lot of success, just help us with the mindset around what else may be out there given the success you've seen already. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's a very good question, Carter, thank you. In fact, having a new CTO on the team over the last year is really helping us dig in a lot more into where we're spending our money and where we shouldn't be spending our money going forward. I mean, you're right, over the last couple of years we've raised our investment in IRAD. This year we closed at just over 5% of revenue, which is above where everyone else in the segment, the peers happen to be. It's going to go up again a little bit in fiscal 2020. When tax reform was enacted, we took our fiscal 2018 number up about $20 million, because we saw new opportunities in things like robotics that we invested in. So, we continue to look at how we spend money, we look at the return on different programs, we look at how we leverage capabilities across the company. Lots of places around Harris invest in various features of software or waveforms, and we're thinking about how do we leverage the investments we have across the company in a more productive way. So that's one of the things our CTO is helping us think about. As I go out a year or two or three from here, I don't think we'll be substantially higher than as a percentage of revenue. So, I see it neither as a margin drag nor tailwind on our margins. But if we continue to find good opportunities to invest, invest ahead of the curve, invest ahead of where the customer is going to go. And I think as you look at the results we're pointing out today and very good growth, it really does come from some of the IRAD investments we've made in the last three or four years. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Is there a way to increase the velocity of opportunities that you're identifying down at the segment level so you can deploy more dollars in that direction? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, that's certainly something that we're looking at very, very carefully and something that we're focused on as an organization. Certainly, as you deploy tools like DevOps, it's going to help you develop products which have significant software content faster. The concept is basically being able to integrate your \u2013 continuously integrate and test software builds so that you always have a software feature that you can field in market, and that is something that we have not developed \u2013 a lot of the defense companies have not, and that is going to compress the cycle time for software pretty substantially. We've seen that in multiple cases where we deployed DevOps. As we go out the next two years to three years, you know by fiscal 2021, we think 85% or 90% of our new starts will be on DevOps, I think that's going to be a key thing to compressing our overall cycle time in developing and launching new products, Carter. Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC : Awesome. Thanks for the color, Bill. Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Carter, I just wanted to add to what Bill said. So just to give you an example or a couple of different examples, a lot of \u2013 like if you take Communication Systems as a segment, we've been investing a lot in hardware over the last couple of years with SOCOM and the Army all the products coming on. So even that is kind of coming to an end at this point, with SOCOM Manpack is a one big program that is going to work on next year. So, a lot of the attention now is going to shift to waveforms and the software that goes onto those radios, and how do we monetize that revenue stream as we've done previously with the MUOS waveform. So, there's a shift of where we're spending the dollars are happening as well within our R&D space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Just a couple of questions. I was hoping you could kind of update us on the pipeline at Tactical RS, DoD International and if you can call out any larger campaigns that you're pursuing? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Sure. Yeah. First, on the international side, pipeline is actually still very good. It's about $2.3 billion, it's still about the same where we were last quarter. You know, the makeup really looks about the same about 50% is Middle East and Africa. You know, Iraq remains a big opportunity. It was pretty substantial in 2018. It will be a substantial amount in 2019 and beyond. So, there's really good opportunities there. About 30% is in Europe and we're starting to see a little bit of a shift from Eastern Europe to Western Europe from countries like Poland and Romania to NATO countries, so in Western Europe still a little bit of a shift. And then the balance is going to be in Asia, in Central and Latin America, a little bit in Canada. In Asia, we see Australia some additional opportunities on the rise and other smaller countries in Asia. And we see in Central America, we see Mexico being a bigger opportunity in 2019 than we had in 2018. So, overall the trends I think are very positive in the International. We ended up having a good year in fiscal 2018 in International, a little bit better than we thought, down less than 1% and a little bit better in Europe than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. So, played out a little bit better than we had thought. And I think we'll be back to low-mid-single digit growth in fiscal 2019. Do you want to cover the DoD? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah, the DoD, Gautam, the DoD Tactical, it's right, it has actually grown since we last spoke. The DoD Tactical pipeline is now $1.7 billion, which includes about $400 million, $450 million of the modernization pipeline and about $1.2 billion, $1.25 billion on the base side so that's \u2013 so it's \u2013 I think last time we spoke, it was around a $1.5 billion if I remember correctly. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Right. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. And just curious if you've seen any sort of potential blowback from some of the more challenged relationships the U.S. has with NATO allies, is there any \u2013 can you talk about your incumbency there and how much of a \u2013 how difficult it is for some of the NATO allies to switch away from the Harris radios that they've already purchased in? I'm just curious like is there any potential blowback from the friction we're seeing where they may prefer European suppliers or what have you instead? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Gautam, it's interesting. I see \u2013 we've seen no blowback in fact, I would say it's going in the other direction we're seeing more opportunities than we've seen in the past with NATO countries. I think it's turning out to be a little bit more of a positive than a negative in lots of ways. We are seeing coalition partners, NATO partners stepping up with more defense spending. And we do see opportunities that are increasing for Harris on the Tactical Radio side not decreasing. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And just one last one from me, you guys have been repurchasing quite a bit of stock, raising the dividend, repaying debt. How does this M&A fit into your medium-term plans, if at all? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, look, I mean I think you pointed out. I mean I think we've done a lot of good things on the balance sheet, we'll generate a $1 billion dollars of cash this year. We've been paying a dividend that's just under $300 million, we'll evaluate that at our August board meeting and decide if there's an increase and to what extent. We have a placeholder out there for $400 million worth of buyback, we have $300 million of debt that's due at the backend of the year. And over the course of 2019, we're going to evaluate that $400 million share buyback placeholder as to whether it's the best places to buy back our stock or to look at M&A. Certainly, as we get beyond 2019 when you really step up more on free cash that you see any \u2013 in fact any drag on debt repayments go to zero. We're going to generate more free cash and more optionality on that cash for M&A. So, look, we're going to \u2013 we're building our strategic pipeline on M&A. We're looking at a variety of different opportunities all within core segments and that will bolster our ability to compete. But nothing more to report on today, certainly, with the way we execute on Exelis and how we transformed the business at Harris, I'm very confident that any deal we do would be accretive and would be effective when we execute it and would be strategic to the company. Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, Jon. How are you doing? Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Rahul, can you step us through some of the cash building blocks heading into next year? You went through a couple of them in your prepared remarks, but can you just sort of narrow in on things like working capital, cash flow, headwind versus tailwind? And then also, I know you mentioned CapEx, so a little bit more on cash building blocks towards the $1 billion? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Yeah, absolutely. Jon, so in 2019, our net income is up about $140 million. And we get the cash tax benefit of about $90 million from the pension funding that we did or prefunding that we did back in 2018 and that's getting partially offset by increase in working capital of about $30 million to $40 million. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our days come down by one day, but we still because the revenue growth \u2013 we still see some drag on working capital. So, there is about $35 million of CapEx growth and it's primarily to fund new program starts like the FTI India win that Bill mentioned. Our ERP investment is a multi-year investment, it's a little bit of step up in that as well. Classified wins that we got in Space this year that required a little bit of CapEx. So, it's about $35 million growth in CapEx. And then there's some cash tax refunds that we got in 2019 from old payments in fiscal 2018 that we discussed earlier and that's a headwind as well and that won't repeat. So, you put all that together we feel good about the $1 dollars, but as we look further out Jon and look into fiscal 2020, you know the big one-time item that we have in fiscal 2019 is this $90 million of cash tax benefit from pension prefunding. And as we look at fiscal 2020, we think there's several offsets to that, the biggest being we have not yet recovered the Exelis restructuring outflows that we had from the government. It's a proposal (44:03) restructuring proposal, it's a multi-year approval process and we start recovering all the money that we have previously spent and we recovered that through our cost-plus program. So, there's a little bit of outflow in Exelis restructuring that still happening in the $10 million to $15 million range that kind of goes away. We do think that CapEx is a tailwind in fiscal 2020, because a lot of the program CapEx will be kind of behind us also the ERP implementation starts winding down. And then we're working on several other cash tax saving projects that we've kicked off this year and that will start delivering results in fiscal 2020. So, put all that together there's enough to offset the $90 million of one-time benefit that we'll get in fiscal 2019 and then earnings drive cash flow growth in 2020 and beyond. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. That's very, very helpful. And then just on the investment decisions. And then Bill, thank you for all the color you offered earlier in the call. Can you just offer some perspective on what role the customer is making or playing in driving those decision? Do you sense that customers are desiring to see more investments upfront that you can then deliver a more mature product at the other end? Just kind of curious what the customer conversations like when it comes to approaching CapEx and also R&D investments. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's a very good question, man. It's been a multi-year push by our DoD customers for industry to step up in R&D. And I think we heard that message that demand signal. We started to step up on this four years or five years ago. And I think that's paying some dividends today. We don't make investments in R&D internally without really understanding the business case, and understanding where the customer is going. The messages that we're hearing from them and we shape our internal investment pipeline accordingly. So, it's all very well connected to where we believe the customers are going. Input from them and I think, the fact that we've been willing to step up internally has paid dividends for us. And you see that very clearly upon what's happening on Electronic Warfare, with an area that was underinvested in by Exelis we stepped up dramatically in Electronic Warfare. And now, we've not only positioned ourselves to retain our strong platform position on F-16, F-18, B-52 but also now we're starting to get into the mix for re-competes on fifth-gen aircraft and proprietary platforms that are being envisioned down the road. So, I think one good example of where we're hearing the message, shaping our investments and I think we're investing smartly on behalf of shareowners. So, I think it's all pretty tightly connected. And again, our new CTO is going to help us shape it even further in the next couple of years. Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Just on the medium-term target, there's solid growth outlook across the portfolio. I guess, how do you think about biggest risks, whether it's budget related or maybe tied to Op (47:09) pursuits in the pipeline? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: A little bit difficult to hear, but I think you're referring to the medium-term outlooks and \u2013 first of all budget is going to be an important driver to that. What I've seen very positively in the NDAA, which passed the House, it's supposed to be at the Senate this week, it could be signed by the President, before we even get out of fiscal 2018, which would be pretty unique. I think very encouraging to us as well as to all the people who issue procurement decisions in DoD, if the NDAA can get signed that quickly, and maybe even an Appropriations Bill by the end of September, that's even a possibility. So, I think these are all very positive indicators. So, when you look at Harris, last time I talked about medium-term as mid-single digit growth plus, I think now it's mid-to-high single digits, you see that coming through in 2019. It's really across the segments. I think a very important driver of that is going to be in the Communication Systems segment where we do see a very strong ramp in DoD in the Tactical Radio business, and we've been focusing a lot on commentary around the Army. We see the budgets growing pretty dramatically on the Army over the next four or five years. But you also see SOCOM growing, you see the Air Force being strong, and you see the Marine Corps recap coming in quite substantially. So, when I look at our next five years, there's about $5.5 billion worth of budget available to Harris on the Tactical Radio side that supports our business cumulative over the next five years. So, it's very, very encouraging to me. We also see I think great progress on some of the platforms in both Avionics and Electronic Warfare. I think we're just really starting this big growth. The IDIQ we won on the F-16 EW platform internationally was for $400 million. So, we booked an award for Turkey in Q4, that was $60 million (48:59), we had Morocco before that. We have about a $1.5 billion opportunity that's ahead of us on international F-16s, F-18's going to grow, the F-35's going to grow, and again, I think we're on the frontend of a nice growth trajectory on the Space Classified business. So, Sheila, really as I look at the business and I see even things that have been headwinds turn to tailwinds like environmental, really across the franchise I see really good growth prospects. Some of it's driven by \u2013 and a lot of it driven by where the budgets are growing. But I think a lot of it's driven by how well we've positioned our portfolio and the differentiators we have in our products and our solutions. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you, Bill. And then just one more. You mentioned software as a potential opportunity for yourselves and the defense primes. I guess how do we think about software evolving as a contributor to the top-line over time and where are those opportunities? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, it's going to be \u2013 today, it's more than 40% of the work content we do in engineering. So, it really is today part of the top line. Five years ago, it would've been half that or 25% of our engineering content. As we go forward, it's going to be more than 40%, it can grow to 50%, 55%, 60%. I think where it's going to contribute to the top-line, Sheila, is how good we are at ingesting and maturing DevOps within this company so that we become strategically better than other players in the space, so we can develop software faster with lower defect rates, with better capability. And I think the more we can do that, that is where I think it's going to contribute mostly to the top-line as I see that. To me over the next four or five years, I think it's going to be fundamental to how we and probably other players in the space develop products. A lot of it's going to turn on software and I think the best people in this space are the ones that are going to win. Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Seth. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You mentioned that Space driving the higher CapEx, and I wonder if you could talk about, if you can at all, what's underlying that. And then just the \u2013 that's an area of the budget where we've seen a lot of additional resources, and maybe how you're seeing that play out in terms of what contracts are coming up so far, what areas are most exciting for you guys. And then maybe to bring it back around to the CapEx, when we look out to fiscal 2020 and beyond where you see CapEx overall for the company kind of shaking out. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, yeah, I mean, look, on the Space side, it's very exciting, a lot of stuff that's happening. We talked the last quarter about a $0.5 billion exquisite win that we have to a prime on a mission are that we've had some experience on. It's going to deliver over the next five, six years. Our piece of that is probably more front-end loaded, there's some capital associated with that program. We've talked over the last year about our positioning on smallsats. We have multiple contract awards on that. That's going exceptionally well. There is some capital associated with that. And as that matures over the next 12 months or so, there's lots of other mission areas and components and capabilities that will be augmenting that smallsat mission that we're positioning ourselves on. It's all, I think, very exciting. Space superiority is a huge growth driver for the company. I talked about our growth in that area being more than 15% this past year. We see that continuing to grow, we think we're well-positioned for opportunities for \u2013 on ground control systems as well as space situational awareness. So lots of different ways we're competing on, on space superiority. And the last one is on the optics side. With Exelis, we acquired a great capability up in our Rochester facility for optics and there is a recap of a lot of different capabilities in Space, some are RF related and some are optics related. And those recapitalizations sometimes requires some additional capital investment. So that all goes together in some of the things we're spending our growth capital on in 2019. As Rahul mentioned, we're up to about $170 million in 2019. We'll see that mitigate itself a little bit going into fiscal 2020, probably down around $15 million or $20 million as we get through a lot of this sort of one-time growth capital we see in 2019. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. And then just maybe as a quick follow-up, Rahul, as we go through the year, anything we should be aware of in terms of the cadence of the sales or the earnings this year? Rahul Ghai - Harris Corp.: Our sales are typically a little bit backend loaded as you \u2013 and that's kind of \u2013 it's a 48%/52% split traditionally for us. DoD, Tactical, as I mentioned earlier, is a little bit backend loaded, the SOCOM and the Army handhelds are \u2013 they basically don't start till tail-end of Q2. So, December-ish is when they start and then a ramp in the second half of the year. And then Manpack kind of starts Q2 our time. So, a little bit more backend loaded than typical. But so other than that, ES and Space should be fairly typical. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: We should see the orders that Rahul is referencing on SOCOM handheld and Army handheld more in the front end of the year and with the execution delivery, the revenue, towards the backend in Q2 into the back half. Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much, guys. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet, Seth. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Hey, good morning. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Hey, good morning, Josh. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Bill, you just mentioned the hiring of a new design team, the new CTO, consolidating ERPs, changing some of the way you approach development. What kind of benchmarking have you done for that? And then what's the timeline on some of those efforts and maybe where we would see the impact first? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, I think broadly over the last five or six years, as I started to reshape this OpEx program we have at Harris, I've been talking about what I consider to be a good OpEx program is a program that delivers 2% to 3% net of cost, so 2% to 3% savings, net of what's given back to the government, net of inflation dropping to the bottom line. And we've been running towards the high end of that 2.5% to 3% range really over the last five or six years, and I expect that to continue and maybe even go above that over the next several years. What's driving it is changing over time. Of course supply chain is important and there's some engineering productivities, the labor productivity in our factories, but even through Exelis integration, we continue to see on top of the savings from the Exelis integration opportunities to just get better every day at what we do, and that's going to be continuation. So that was from my experience at UTC and what I see other companies doing. So, I think that is generally pretty good. In terms of benchmarking on ERP systems, it's hard to say, but I can tell you 20 systems today is too many, and three is about the right number. We've got a government business, we've got a commercial business, and one is \u2013 it's pretty fairly unique, which is why we're at three. But really what we're doing is, we're bringing people into the company in senior roles either an IT or technology or other places that have experience outside of Harris to really look at what we do and bring best practices from their experiences here, and that is what's giving us some shining the light on some new opportunities that really are in front of us. And as I said, as I look into the future, I see as much opportunity ahead of us as I've seen we captured in the recent past. So, I think the ground is pretty fertile on continuing to get better, drive efficiency and productivity really across our business in the next couple of years. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then just with the new medium target \u2013 medium-term targets, can you update us on the Rochester facility utilization, and maybe where you see that utilization going over the next two to three years? I know you just mentioned in the previous question some opportunities in optics, does that change the paradigm at all? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: It doesn't, no, I mean in fact in our Rochester Tact, we've got multiple facilities up in Rochester and on the tactical side, we've been running in the low 60% \u2013 60% utilization. You know there're plenty of opportunity to grow in that Rochester facility without any additional capital, it's about six years old. But even there as we go to multiple shifts there's opportunities to do something different with some of the components we make there. So, I see no capacity limitations on the rise in, in our Rochester Tactical facility. And for that matter really in any other facilities we do a lot of optics work at some other things up in Rochester. And I don't see any limitation there. I think the spike we're seeing this year on capital is really on specific programs and program capital not on basically not on infrastructure capital. Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thanks so much. Good afternoon. Good morning, sorry. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Good morning, Rob. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I'm going to Slide 13 and the medium-term guidance Bill, it may sound a bit pedantic, but your commentary said you expect the revenue growth rate to accelerate up to high-single digit. Well, you kind of going to get there in 2019, if everything goes to plan. So, do you see the potential to go faster than what you're guiding to in 2019? And then in relation to that how sustainable do you think this sort of growth rate is, is it sort of a one or two years and it slows, or do you see this as being a sort of three year, four year, five year affair? William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Well, first, on that slide, the Electronic Systems and Space and Intel, there is an acceleration from what we see in fiscal 2019 or in fiscal 2018. So there's some acceleration there. We see CS and Communications to continue to be at a high-single digit range. Frankly, I think as I look back on 2018 and where we started our guidance on 2018 \u2013 keep in mind we started, I believe it was 15% or mid-teens on DoD Tactical. Then we went up to 20% or low-20s% and we ended at 35%. So, I'm not so sure, I'm really sort of calling it accurately. I think we're being more conservative than aggressive in our assumptions and hopefully with the same place today in 2019, and hopefully beyond there as well. As we see opportunities placed \u2013 put on order a lot faster than we saw over the last couple of years, and this is a pretty remarkable phenomenon. Orders are being placed, dollars are being obligated at a much faster rate not just in DoD but also in the intelligence community, certainly from where we were a year or two ago. And that's been a very positive surprise. And like I said the NDAA getting approved out of the House and maybe even getting approved by the President before we even hit September is pretty unique. And I think what's happening when that \u2013 when things like that happen, it gives encouragement to people who issue procurement decisions to obligate dollars faster. Their confidence goes up. So, I continue to see opportunities in 2019 and beyond. So, what's medium-term, medium term to us is three to four years. As I look at it and we look at our positioning, the amount of unused dollars that are not yet committed, where the budgets are growing and what we see in the budget that we can actually see over the next five years, there's a lot of opportunity to continue really robust growth across Harris, going out in that three-year, four-year, five-year period, Rob. Robert A. Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC : That's great. Thanks for it, Bill. William M. Brown - Harris Corp.: Okay. You bet. Anurag Maheshwari - Harris Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call this morning, and please do not hesitate to get in touch with me for any additional questions. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Discussions today will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation, and Harris SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Okay, well, thank you Anurag, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong second quarter results, with a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96, up 19% on 9% revenue growth. Orders, revenue, and operating margin were up in all segments and overall company margin expanded 150 basis points to 19.6%. These results extend our strong first quarter performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first half up 24% on 9% revenue growth and 24% higher free cash flow. And today we're raising guidance for the year on revenue, margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. The highlight again this quarter was our sustained top-line growth, the third consecutive quarter of high-single-digit growth. Order momentum remained strong and was up 27% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.06 for the quarter and funded backlog up 20% over last year, all driven by our multi-year investments in innovation, strong customer positions, high win rates, and a favorable budget environment. The merger with L3 is on track for mid-calendar 2019 close and integration planning is progressing well. But let me start providing some color on the quarter performance before closing our prepared remarks with a few comments on the merger. So turning to Slide 4 in the webcast, Communications Systems revenue was up 10% in the quarter with strong growth in all three businesses : Tactical Communications, Night Vision and Public Safety. In Tactical, international delivered another solid quarter up 11% driven by the ramp of modernization programs in Australia, standardization of Harris equipment in NATO countries in Western Europe, continued border security programs in Eastern Europe and the third technology refresh for a longstanding customer in Northern Africa. For the first half, international revenue was up 7% driven principally by Asia-Pacific and a strong second quarter recovery in Europe and book-to-bill was greater than 1. That combined with a solid pipeline of $2.5 billion reaffirms our expectations that international will grow low-to-mid single digits in fiscal 2019 with sequential growth in the second half. On the DoD side, Tactical revenue was up 7% for the quarter despite a tough compare and growth across the services shifting from readiness to modernization. We started to deliver on a $90 million Army HMS Manpack LRIP that we booked in Q4 of last year; we remain on track to complete the delivery by this summer. For the SOCOM two-channel handheld program, we successfully completed operational user assessment, delivered initial units, and expect production to ramp through the second half of the fiscal year. For the Marine Corps, we booked $75 million order for MUOS software upgrades for Falcon III Manpack radios and recognized $24 million of revenue in the quarter with a balance to shift by fiscal year-end. This award brings MUOS orders since its launch in 2016 to about $175 million highlighting our ability to generate additional software revenue on previously sold hardware. For the first half, DoD Tactical revenue was up 17% driven by the ramp in modernization programs and strong Q1 readiness demand and orders were up 45% with a book-to-bill of 1.7. Pipeline remained solid at $1.6 billion and with anticipated second half modernization growth we now expect DoD revenue will be up in the low 20% range for the year versus up mid teens at the start of the year. Overall for Tactical, first half revenue increased 11%, book-to-bill was 1.3, and backlog increased 34% to over $1.1 billion. The growth in Tactical coupled with strong revenue and order growth in Night Vision and Public Safety give us confidence to increase Communication Systems revenue guidance to up 10% to 11% for the year versus prior guidance of up 9% to 10%. In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 6%, the sixth consecutive quarter revenue growth. This strong performance was driven by sustained growth in long-term platforms F-35, F-18, F-16, which collectively grew double-digits as we leverage technology upgrades, ramp production, and expanded our international footprint. We also saw growth on SOCOM rotary platforms as we began to modernize legacy electronic warfare systems to address new threats and requirements. Order momentum continue to be strong growing 12% and for the sixth straight quarter book-to-bill was greater than 1 as we expand our electronic warfare and avionics franchises. In electronic warfare, we booked $115 million in contracts from Iraq and Poland to upgrade the EW capabilities of their F-16 aircraft, adding to the previously announced Turkey and Morocco awards, and continuing the international expansion of our F-16 EW program. With $225 million of funding remaining on the previously announced $400 million sole source IDIQ contract and several additional international opportunities in the pipeline, we remain confident in the growth trajectory of our EW business. In addition, we've partnered with Northrop on the recently announced Next-Gen Jammer Low Band program which will significantly increase airborne electronic attack capabilities on the EA-18G Growler. This win is the combination of a multi-year strategy to invest in adding features, functionality, and capability to our EW products to enable us to increase content on existing platforms and win new pursuits. In avionics, we're leveraging our open system architecture technology and recent award on the F-35 mission processor to win content on two new strategic platforms, a large UAV, and a new trainer aircraft. These wins build on the F-35 success and provide significant multi-year follow-on opportunities. For the first half, Electronic Systems revenue was up 7.4% and book-to-bill was 1.2 resulting in a backlog increase of 24%. The pipeline remains robust at $16 billion with $3 billion in proposals outstanding and we continue to expect revenue segment to be up 7% to 8% this year. And then, finally, in Space and Intelligent Systems, revenue growth accelerated to 11% in the quarter as our multi-year investments to innovate ahead of customer needs led to high-teens growth in the classified business which more than offset the expected headwinds on environmental programs. We continue to be successful in expanding the addressable market of our classified business by providing end-to-end mission solutions and penetrating new adjacencies. In our small satellite franchise, we received awards of more than $350 million over the past three years to develop and produce 17 satellites with five different customers as we move from pathfinder mission to building a full constellation in space. And on the new ground based adjacency, we have nearly tripled the program since our first win in second quarter of fiscal 2017 solidifying our position with this customer. We see this momentum continuing with several new wins in the second quarter that extend our positions on existing programs as well as create new franchises that will have significant follow-on opportunities. Last month, we were awarded a $218 million follow-on contract from the U.S. Army for wideband SATCOM operational management system network, a 35% increase over the initial order reflecting the customer's confidence in Harris's Technology and capabilities. We also leverage our mission knowledge and secured an $80 million order from the Space Enterprise Consortium to enhance space-based position, navigation, and timing systems by providing additional capabilities to detect and mitigate harmful interference. Technology matured on this program is expected to transition over time to future generations of GPS satellites and various other payloads. In addition, we continue to strengthen our position on [exquisite] [ph] systems receiving a $115 million contract to provide next-generation technology for a long-standing classified franchise. And finally, earlier this month, we received a $185 million follow-on sustainment and modernization award for counter communication that will be a standard for the Air Force going forward. I'm also pleased to note that we had a record launch quarter in Q2 validating our leadership position in hosted payloads and small satellites. We successfully launched three small satellites including Harris's first smallsat called HSAT showcasing our ability to provide an end-to-end solution including ground command and control from our Phillis facilities here in Florida. We also witnessed for launch of the first GPS-3 satellite with the Harris navigational payload which is performing well through initial system checks. Two international satellites were also successfully launched with Harris payloads, one for Japan's Ministry of the Environment and the other for the Korean Aerospace Institute further embedding us as the leader in environmental sensors. And in just a few weeks ago, Iridium completed its final launch and now has a constellation of 66 satellites in space with 232 Harris reprogrammable hosted payloads on board providing persistent real time tracking of ships and aircraft globally along with a few other missions. For Space and Intel, first half performance was better than anticipated with revenue up 8% and backlog up 10%. With about 92% of second half fiscal 2019 revenue and backlog, and an high confidence follow-on opportunities, and a $10 billion pipeline, we now expect revenue growth of 6% to 7% for the segment, a two point increase from a previous guidance of 4% to 5%. Overall with our strong first half performance, solid backlog coverage, new wins in a growing pipeline we are increasing total company revenue guidance to be up 8% to 8.5% versus previous guidance of up 6% to 8% with earnings per share now at $7.90 to $8 and free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.025 billion. So let me now turn it over to Rahul to cover financial results and some more detail before we close with a few comments on the merger. Rahul Ghai : Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis excluding L3 deal and integration costs as well as one-time charges in the prior year. Turning now to the total company results on Slide 5, revenue was up 9% in the second quarter and earnings before interest and taxes increased 18% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 150 basis points to 19.6%. EPS grew by 19% and free cash flow increased 25% to $323 million for the quarter as we reduced 10 days of working capital compared to last year. For the first half, revenue was up 9% and earnings before interest and taxes were up 15% with margin expanding 90 basis points to 19.5%. Free cash flow was robust in the first half at $409 million, a 24% increase over the prior year and was approximately $1 billion over the last 12 months. Second quarter EPS bridge on Slide 6. EPS grew by 19% or $0.31 with strong operational performance more than offsetting a higher tax rate. The $0.35 increase from operations was driven by high volume in tactical radios, avionics, and classified space and solid program execution which more than offset lower environmental volume and increased R&D investments. A higher tax rate relative to last year which included the catch-up benefit from tax reform reduced EPS by $0.04. Segment details on Slide 7, Communications Systems second quarter revenue was $540 million, up 10% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in Tactical, revenue was up double-digits in Night Vision and Public Safety as the businesses converted strong orders to revenue. Operating income for the segment was up 12% and margins expanded 50 basis point to 30% from volume leverage and operational efficiencies partially offset by program and product mix. Orders grew by 33% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.2 for the quarter. In addition to the order momentum from Tactical modernization programs, we continued to execute well on our strategy of expanding into the adjacent airborne segment for the $66 million order with small tactical terminal airborne radios for both domestic and international platforms. And in the Public Safety business, orders grew more than 50% in the quarter as we strengthened our position with the utilities and state and federal agencies with orders from Nevada, AEB, and the Air National Guard. For the first half of the year, segment revenue was up 12% with double-digit growth in all three businesses and operating income increased 16%. Operating margin was up 90 basis points versus the prior year. The segment first half book-to-bill was 1.3. Historical information for tactical orders, revenue, and backlog is included as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. Electronics Systems on Slide 8, segment revenue was $617 million, up 6% for the quarter. Segment operating income increased 21% to $117 million and margin expanded 230 basis point to 19% from strong operational performance and the absence of a one-time contract adjustment in the mission network's business recorded in second quarter of fiscal 2018. Orders were up 12% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.1. In addition to strength on long-term platforms strong growth in the weapons release business led to first half segment revenue growth of 7%. Operating income increased 13% with margin expanding to 19.2%. Segment first half book-to-bill was 1.2. In Space and Intelligent systems on Slide 9, segment revenue was $513 million, up a record 11% and operating income grew 15% as margin expanded 60 basis points from higher volume and strong program execution. First half segment revenue increased 8% with continued growth in classified programs, partially offset by a decline in environmental revenue. Operating margin remained strong at 17.8%. Moving to Slides 10 and 11 for full-year guidance. As Bill mentioned we now expect the revenue to be up 8% to 8.5% versus up 6% to 8% in the prior guidance from increased trend in Tactical Communications and classified space. We are increasing EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of $7.90 to $8. Higher volume in Communication Systems and Space and better than expected operational performance in Electronic Systems is expected to contribute an additional $0.13 to EPS. This will be partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $0.03 as floating interest rates trend higher. EPS at the midpoint will now be up 25% for the year with about 60% of the growth coming from operations and the remaining 40% from lower share count and a benefit of a lower tax rate. Total company margin is now expected to be between 19.5% and 20% an increase from the previous guidance of 19.3% to 19.7% from increased volume in high margin Communications Systems segment and improvement in margins in Electronic Systems. We had increasing free cash flow guidance to a range of $1 billion to $1.025 billion driven by higher earnings. Switching to segment outlook, in Communication Systems we now expect revenue to be up 10% to 11% versus up 9% to 10% previously driven by strength in DoD Tactical Communication, the operating margin guidance of 29.5% to 30.5% remains unchanged. In Electronic Systems revenue guidance remains unchanged at up 7% to 8%. Operating margin is now expected to be between 18.5% and 19.5% versus 18% to 19% previously from strong program execution. In Space and Intelligent systems, we now expect revenue to be up 6% to 7% versus up 4% to 5% previously driven by better than expected growth in classified programs. The operating margin guidance range of 17% to 18% remains unchanged. And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks. Bill Brown : Okay, thanks Rahul. So overall, we're performing exceptionally well in all segments and across all metrics. Orders, revenue, backlog, margins, earnings per share, cash, and we're on track for a record year. There has been a lot of discussion around the GFY 20 Defense budget. We continue to believe that the President supports increased funding to meet national security demands and with outlays continuing to lag budget appropriations overall as well as in the budget lines that matter to Harris, we expect growth momentum to continue in the medium term in the mid-to-high-single-digit range. From this position of strength, we decided about three months ago to merge with L3 to create a leading global defense company. We are well into the regulatory process and continue to expect a mid calendar 2019 close. On January 10, we received a second request for information from the Department of Justice and we continue to work cooperatively with the DOJ on its review. As part of the regulatory process, we're moving proactively to explore the possible sale of our Night Vision business. The government shutdowns affected to team handling our merger filing but we believe we have enough slack in the schedule to absorb the near-term delay without impacting the mid-year closing. We\u2019re also tracking well in international approval processes including European Commission and we've held informal discussions with the UK authority should a filing be required in the event of a hard Brexit at the end of March. Integration planning is progressing well with about 50 dedicated leaders from Paris and L3 who are leveraging Harris\u2019s Exelis experience and skill set to develop detailed plans to achieve $500 million of cost synergies and $3 billion of free cash flow. Chris and I are deeply involved in the integration planning and have weekly meetings with the teams to ensure that we capture the full value of the merger and hit the ground running on day one following the close. We both have spent considerable time meeting and getting to know each other's leadership team and have made good progress in developing an organizational model that's lean, mission-focused, and leverages the best of both companies. All in all, we're tracking on or ahead of schedule as we execute this transformational combination. So with that, let me ask the operator to open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Bill, first of all I thought we'd start with CS, very strong DoD performance both on revenues and orders in the quarter and I was wondering if it's your perception whether the DoD is adding incremental demand into your backup or whether this is pulling forward activity that you may have expected to occur in the future? Bill Brown : No, I think this is just a continuation of a very, very strong ramp in the DoD business, last year, if you remember, we increased our guidance through the year, we started off in the high teens 20%, we ended in the mid-30s, we're seeing a similar trajectory this year but a shift from readiness to modernization, the modernization ramp clearly has happened, we're seeing significant growth in modernization spend as we expected and have communicated to our investors over the last couple of years. Robert Stallard : Okay. And then secondly on the L3 Front, it looks like they had a few execution issues this quarter in their results this morning. I was wondering if you put the two business together whether there is some, say, process expertise that you could bring to the table and maybe improve the execution of the combined business going forward? Bill Brown : Well I think you'll hear from Chris later on this afternoon on his business and his performance last year, his expectations for this year I think overall Chris and I have worked well together, we're working well with the team. One of the key focus areas of integration is on operational excellence and certainly L3 as L365 we have our HPX program and putting them together we think collectively we will find a way through the combined companies to continue to execute, execute better, capture our revenue and cost synergy. So Rob I think it's all good stuff and I think the company's going to benefit from both our programs in 2019 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Bill, you mentioned MUOS and the opportunity for software upgrades, is there any way to think about how big this opportunity is both domestically and internationally? Bill Brown : Well, it's a good question because just on specifically on MUOS, we made an investment a few years ago to customize that waveform, so it's easy to download and just a software download onto our 117 G, we have about 30,000 out in the field U.S. DoD, International not all of them will be upgraded, some will be replaced with a new radio particularly in the Army. So we think the opportunity for us is something around 70,000 radios maybe a bit more than that. I think we've already installed about 10,000 in the Marine Corps, a few in the Air Force, so we still see some upside, in DoD, we see some upside in just specifically in MUOS and international markets like particularly in Canada, in this part of the long run plan for the company and we've seen that shift in how we're spending IRAD moving from hardware development to software and waveform development, we think that's going to be a differentiator for that business in the future. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay. And then just on ES, performance have been better just on execution, any color around what was driving that and how sustainable do you think it is to reach that 19.5% margin? Bill Brown : So I think the question was on ES. It was a little bit difficult to hear. But we're very proud of what they've done; they're growing very well for the first half up 7.5% about the same for the back half. So again 7%, 8% for the year, margins are good and actually getting better in the year, we feel really good about long-term platforms, we've talked about our avionics business, electronic warfare across those three platforms I mentioned before F-18, F-16 and F-35 we're really excited about the wins we've seen in F-35, the future is very, very bright in that business, we see over the course of the back end of the year continued growth in orders particularly around developments in the UAE and we see a lot of optimism going into fiscal 2020. So yes the whole team I think has done exceptionally well in managing their investments, positioning their business very well, growing the pipeline and you're seeing the results of that hard work comes through in fiscal 2019. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Okay, thank you. Rahul Ghai : On the margins, Sheila, we've guided to even in our medium term guidance that we have laid out back in August, we had said that we expected upside from the 18.5% that we\u2019re guiding to this year. We've had guided there was a plus next to it and we have seen some of that kind of coming to this year but as we continue down the path of cost reduction, the business is 75%, 80% cost that is fixed price, so as we continue to take cost out of that in that business they should be margin upside there as well in the outer years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hey, good morning. Bill, I wanted to follow-up on Rob Stallard's question before with regard to L3 and some of the margin pressures that they showed, this morning I think investors are very excited and intrigued by your $3 billion free cash flow target that you and Chris have laid out but maybe they are a bit skeptical on how you get there since that seems to be more lift of their margins and I wanted to talk about that $0.5 billion in gross synergies, $300 million in net, how much that is process improvement where the Harris model once overlaid on the L3 assets helps to lift that or does it have to do with other obviously there's going be day one costs and so forth. So I wanted to chop up that that number and see if we can understand where it's coming from and over and how it plays out over the let's call it three year horizon? Bill Brown : Yes, okay. So no change today in terms of our expectations or in cost synergies, still $500 million gross, $300 million net, over the next three years. In the building blocks that haven't changed either about 50% is coming from direct and indirect spend and facility rationalization. We see about 25% from the consolidation of the headquarters functions and segments, and the other 25% from functional efficiency shared services, it really comes from both companies, there's not initially more coming from one or the other we see about 40% of that or so happening in the first year mainly from segment and headquarter consolidation, we will see some indirect spend coming through as well but look we've been through this path before with Exelis. We've spent the last six or seven years at Harris developing an operational excellence agenda, a rigor around that it extends well beyond supply chain, it goes into our factories, it goes into our engineering function, it's permeated across all of our administrative functions, we've leveraged a shared service center. So today we have all of our IT across the company centralized in one location, 15 other processes, financial and others that are now centralized in a shared service activity. I think L3 is further at the front end of that journey and you'll see some margin upside that will come simply because that's the path that they were on themselves. So we'll see that -- we'll see margins grow in the combined company through both what they have laid out in the rest for us about a point of margin growth on their own not a point on Harris side plus another 150 or so, 200 basis points on synergies. So this is a great story that's playing itself out. I think the story is really compelling, that translates into free cash. I think I've got a lot of confidence in hitting $3 billion of free cash in three years, we're starting from about $2 billion we will see some organic growth. In the back part of it is really the after-tax cost synergies but also keep in mind working capital performance. This is something that we've been able to achieve pretty well at Harris post Exelis, we took about 20 days out of working capital, we're only assuming six or seven days out of the combined company which will have 70 days. So I feel very optimistic about generating additional cash coming out of the combined company, Rob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Bill, could you comment on your forecast that were contained in the S4 relative to your medium-term outlook, it doesn't seem like the forecasts in the S4 splits with what you're talking about in terms of the medium-term? Bill Brown : Yes, the -- what was in the S4 was generated in our strategic plan earlier last year. We've seen a little more -- little more tailwind in the budget, a little more tailwind in our numbers, you see we are taking our revenue guidance up this year, so we still see our growth in the mid-to-high-single-digit. I think in the S4 it was around 3%, 6%, 7% CAGR over the next three, four, five years. We're probably a little bit better than that today based on what we're now seeing in fiscal 2019 and again this is we're seeing really good growth trajectories, our pipelines are strong, they're getting replenished quickly they're growing, our backlog is growing. So I feel certainly better today about 2019 and beyond than what we would have been feeling six to 12 months ago. David Strauss : Okay. Could you talk about how you see your short cycle exposure I think there's some concern in the market if the budget does kind of flatten out that you're more exposed given your higher degree of short cycle exposure, could you just address how much of your business you see is kind of short cycle exposure that could turn quickly? Bill Brown : The short cycle part of our business probably relates mostly to our Tactical business and principally the DoD business. But in that area we're seeing growth in orders backlog is way up, the budgets look very, very strong, certainly what we've seen over the next four to five years, they essentially have doubled their last two years, it's kind of pretty substantially there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We see the budgets growing in the tactical line items by another 30%, 40% in next three or four years. A lot of it\u2019s been driven by Army modernization SOCOM modernization but also the Marine Corps is coming in as well. So we've seen a great trajectory here. When I look at just the budget even if it does flatten off a little bit as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, appropriations are running well ahead of outlays overall and in our line items as well and I think that's going to provide some nice tailwind for us. So I don't see our short cycle business tailing off at all. In fact if anything in the first half, we saw getting a bit stronger. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland : Just a couple of quick ones, one we haven't talked about in a while but obviously the PSPC numbers were pretty strong, is that market finally growing a lot or are you taking share I just wondered if you could clarify that a little bit for us? And then, a second one for you, Bill, just as you continue to work through and think through integration with L3 on the transaction, how are you thinking about internal R&D spending is that -- is that being influenced at all by updated views on revenue synergies, any color you can give us on how you're thinking about that and the combined entity and how it may influence your development spend and mindset? Thanks. Bill Brown : Okay, good, thanks, Carter. Two good questions, I'd love to say that we're gaining share in public safety, I can't really say for sure we've had two very good quarters, we've had a series of quarters four or five in a row where we've seen backlog growing book-to-bill during very positive, the first half revenue was up double-digits which is in my seven years here have never happened. We still seen very good strong order momentum, some, some good bookings. I think it comes back to where we've been over the last couple of years, quality is getting a bit better, we\u2019re seeing a great reception on new products. Adding Nino and the team there are doing a very good job in building our sales force, improving our channel performance, and we're starting to win a bit more on utilities, couple of big state contracts penetrated federal bit better. I think the market is up, it's certainly not up double-digits but the market is a bit stronger but I think we're on a good trajectory here too early to claim success. We've had two good quarters, we're expecting a good year, we are expecting the PSPC to be up high-single-digits which I don't think I've ever thought to be able to say but that's actually a great trend. And I'd love to be sitting here in six months from now looking back on just fiscal 2019 and saying we had a really good year. So off to a really good start, I'm proud of what the team has done in turning that business around and growing the margins, growing the top-line but too soon to say whether it's officially turned around in a great business. So we'll see. On the piece on the IRAD, it's a very good question we're just starting to hit into that between us and L3. Collectively we will spend a little north of $600 million in IRAD maybe $640 million something like that $640 million probably little north of 3% of our revenue combined and we're just now looking at what we spend, what they spend is still very early in this process and we will shape that based on where we see growth opportunities both on organic basis or independent of one another but also on a combined basis, the teams have started to get together and discuss revenue synergies of probably more than hundred ideas that they've come up with, some very interesting ones and over the next six to 12 months, I think the team will start to shape what the IRAD budget will look like in our priorities. And I would imagine it will get shaped, it will shift a bit, based on revenue opportunities that we hadn't seen before between the two companies. So I think more to say probably in the next six months but not much more I can say on that today. Rahul Ghai : Hey, Carter. So going back to the public safety, one additional point I just want to add to what Bill said, the other thing that's helping us we have the only radio that has both the legacy technology and ERP technology on a single radio and that is helping us gain some additional customers. So just introduction of reference introduction of new products, that radio is helping us get some momentum in the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Hey, thanks guys. Great results. Bill Brown : Thank you. Gautam Khanna : Couple of questions. First you mentioned you are exploring and potentially exiting Night Vision at least the Harris Night Vision business, could you again quantify what that expected sales level is in fiscal 2019\u2019s guidance for Harris Night Vision? Bill Brown : Yes, Night Vision for us this year will be in the $150 million to $160 million range, it's probably mid-teens margin there about. Gautam Khanna : Just broader context you looked back at the Tactical Comps business and it wasn't just two years ago when the backlog things were -- there was an air pocket and what have you. Backlogs were up more than 2X. I'm just curious you mentioned the DoD, the international pipeline is $2.5 billion. Where is the DoD pipeline and do you think there is any risk over the next couple of years that we'll see a similar air pocket are we sort of in order frenzy and we're not going to see much in the way of backlog growth, what's the -- what should we be tracking because it's been a pop up in a way for a while now and I'm just curious if we're ever going to see any erosion in backlog over the next year or two and what should we be prepared for? Bill Brown : So it's so good question. So the pipeline is about $1.6 billion on the DoD side, it's up about 12%, 13% year-over-year. A lot of it's coming out of modernization, so we're starting to see this long awaited modernization trend, we're really at the front end of it, modernization revenue for this year we think is in the $270 million to $275 million range. It's up substantially from last year. We see continued support, continued momentum in special operations. We're now shipping into second half of the 2-channel radio, the army we're shipping a 2-channel radio we're down the path of the Manpack or SOCOM, we're heading down the path on delivering on the first LRIP for Manpack, we will see another LRIP coming at the back end of this year probably a third one next year. OT will be next summer, the Marine Corps is now starting to position for their own modernization by. So we're on the front end to what I still believe is a really important ramp, couple of years ago the budgets were about $650 million this year $950 million, according to last year's FDAP they peak around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. So I think we've got a lot of headroom in front of us and as I look at that and just see what's happened over the last three years in our business we've grown about two-thirds in that business. There could be another substantial uptick in our revenue in DoD in the next three years just based on what we see in the budget, the momentum in the business, even with some expectations of a little bit more share gain in that DoD side, the business could be in the range of $900 million to a $1 billion in three years. So we continue to see very good momentum and no hiccups whatsoever but right now in the DoD business, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And just a last one from me, if you could update us on some of the milestones we should be tracking related to the merger. So in terms of when the board is going to be announced the new 10 member board, anything you can give us that we can track in advance with the close? Bill Brown : I think the next thing that we will be talking about probably is once the S4 is approved by the SEC, and we issue you a proxy there will be a shareowners meeting, I can't tell you exactly when that's going to be, that's not the long pole in the tent, it's really getting HSR approval from the U.S. DoD, we probably won't announce anything on the new board structure until after the shareowners meeting. So that'll probably be in the spring timeframe, I'm not sure what other milestones or events we'll be announcing but we still believe based on what we've seen that we'll be able to close by mid calendar year and again should we see any change from that, we will communicate with investors appropriately. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : I was hoping to go back to the synergy in particular the working capital synergy commentary because it\u2019s pretty, pretty impressive number as you achieve it, I'm just curious when you juxtapose the current environment of mid-to-high-single-digit growth for yourselves and mid-single-digit growth for L3 versus what was a flat organic environment and working capital savings are being more difficult, I'm just curious if growth is constraining kind of your six to seven days of reduction in combined company or if that's a baseline you think you could outperform against? Bill Brown : Well, I think I was hearing most of that Myles but look I think the way I look at that opportunity is combined at the end of calendar 2018, we had about 70 days of working capital, so L3 ended around 80, we are about 50 on a comparable apples-to-apples basis to about 70. We're sitting at 50, we took 20 days out with Exelis, we're only was assuming six or seven days out at about $35 million per day more or less, I do think there's opportunities to go beyond that. We have -- we've assigned a consultant team a clean team to kind of look at working capital both Harris and L3 look at the specific entities where we have higher than normal working capital of specific items, some of it is payables, locked inventory, lot of unbilled, those opportunities certainly on the inventory side do take time to action and to achieve that's why we say over the course of three years, we'll be bringing that down. But I believe that there's anything six to seven day improvement is probably, probably on the conservative side, I think there's probably an opportunity to do a bit better than that. And top of that we do see organic growth and just on normal sort of drop through in our business in a 20% tax rate, we do see cash growth simply coming from organic growth. And the other we don't really talk much about is on the capital spending side where we do some of our facilities there might be a little opportunity on capital spending, there is probably a little opportunity on cash taxes, so we've got a lot of things that I think are trending as tailwinds for us that gives us Chris and I a lot of confidence to be able to get $3 billion three years down. Myles Walton : And then your 40% of that cost synergy target in year one, what do you think that is in terms of percentage for your working capital synergy in your one, how quickly does this come off? Bill Brown : So on the 40%, I wasn\u2019t sure I heard all the question 40% of the $500 million of gross synergy will happen year once about $200 million that's going to basically be segment and CHQ consolidations and some indirects. And that's really where that is going to come from. I don't think we really guided anything in terms of working capital improvements in the first year but I know we'll see something, we'll see something in calendar 2019, we'll see more in 2020, we'll see more in 2021, so I don't think it will be -- it's probably a couple of days I guess, we'll see this year. But I think we're really suggesting more than that, we're still seeing six to seven days over the next three years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv : Hey, good morning everyone. Bill on the call, so on your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about readiness demand versus modernization, readiness being a big driver last year now for modernization, can you talk about this kind of those two buckets more broadly and across the business not just CS both this year and going forward in terms of what you've seen your backlog, your pipeline and what you expect out of budgets both here and abroad? Bill Brown : Actually, Jon, I missed the front part of your question, I'm sorry. Jon Raviv : I\u2019m sorry, as you parsed between readiness and modernization, you mentioned how there's a real shift now towards modernization which one would think would give kind of stick your piece of business than readiness which could flex up and down more rapidly? Bill Brown : Yes, so, thank you, Jon, that's a great question. So we had a really good year last year in terms of readiness demand, remember there was a couple of security forces, systems brigade that we fielded that was with the Army, we may see another one this year, we saw a lot of opportunities with the Air Force last year, we saw a little bit more this year on their TAC piece as well as their base support. So readiness now we are starting to shift over this year into modernization, I think you're exactly right there's a lot more stickiness on that there's a discrete budget that's specific to the HMS program to the SOCOM handheld programs the SOCOM Manpack in the Marine Corps, they are specific budget items. So I think there is a lot more stickiness to that, there's IDIQ vehicles both all the services are buying off of those IDIQ vehicles. So we feel very good about what's happening this year-end and really the expectation that that's going to continue into next year. There's a very clear plan that SOCOM in the Army have laid out as to how they want to buy, how they want to feel based on those radios when they want to test, the budgets are coming off of so all of that seems to have a lot more predictability than what we saw in readiness. So to your point I think that's exactly right, we'll see a little more stickiness and predictability on modernization. Jon Raviv : And as the customer seems to as always focuses on getting more for less saving money in this case in light of deficits, I think would you will be able to characterize what your customer conversations have been over the recent weeks and months as you prepare for an FY 2020 budget which is supposed to reflect some, some changes in how the DoD is approaching both how they do business and what they want to focus on in the five-year plan? Bill Brown : Well, look I think the conversation is not a lot different recently than it might have been a year or two ago which is you're right, they do want more for less that that makes sense, they drive the budgets are coming up but affordability is key. They want innovation; they should industry to step up on innovation, spending our own money we have done that, L3 also has done that in significant way. There has been conversations around contract financing that's still a live wire still a live switch but these are the things are sort of going on in the background but at the end of the day, it's a -- according to National Defense Strategy, there's a lot of opportunities to continue to invest, develop new capabilities, field capabilities faster to the war fighter, so every conversation is around innovation, speed to feel the capabilities, affordability those are incentivizing industry to perform, these are all the basic parts of our conversation with DoD including some meetings we had last week. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Bill, I wonder if you could talk maybe a little bit more about the space business, obviously very strong performance in the quarter to the extent possible maybe talk about the degree to which you have visibility on future growth, space has been an important area of the budget and the extent to which that's driven by small versus exquisite? And maybe the last point the meaning of -- you pointed out the first HSAT and kind of the meaning of that and where you sort of see that, that platform going? Bill Brown : Well look at, this is our classified business in space has been very, very strong and call space in general, it's space ground other parts of the different domains that we participate in but the trends have been very, very good. We had a really good start, orders are good, the pipeline is very strong in that business, we've had good success in growing our smallsat franchise. This is something that we've been investing towards for the last four or five years or longer. Certainly the initial work we've done on hosted payloads it is an investment to get ahead of the curve on smallsat are now paying dividends, it's not just with one customer, it's multiple customers both in the IC as well as within DoD. So it's all good news. We launched HSAT with couple of months ago, it's performing very well. The purpose of that investment was simply to demonstrate Harris ability to drive and manage an end-to-end mission. So to be able to build a satellite itself provide all the components, secure launch and do all agreement ground command-and-control and downlink all from our facilities and that is now sort of proven some credibility there. There were another two classified smallsat that launched at the end of last year as well they are also performing well. So again this is a great momentum that's being built and I see continued growth in that particular domain, it's all this drive towards more resiliency in our space architecture. That being said there are still investments to recapitalize on exquisite side, we've also seen good growth on exquisite space, that's a big driver of our growth in 2019 from 2018 and will continue into 2020 and 2021. So that's also quite good and on the ground-based adjacency that program over the last two years has tripled in size, again it's moving from providing a component to now a full mission solution on a whole different mission. So lot of this over the last four or five years is really from this trend that we've been working on moving from components to sub-systems to full end-to-end mission solutions, sometimes that takes investment in IRAD, sometimes it takes building and launching your own smallsat but that's a direction we are moving down. And it allows us to go after a much bigger piece of the overall classified budget which by the way is growing as well. So this is the right direction that we're moving in and the team there Bill Gattle and his team have been very successful, really across all of these dimensions. Seth Seifman : Great, thanks and last one I think when you were speaking earlier about tactical, you mentioned an airborne award and I\u2019m just wondering just as an area that hasn't been a very big part of the franchise historically, are there awards or opportunities out there in airborne that you see as potentially over the longer-term providing opportunities for further growth in Tactical? Bill Brown : Yes, this has been, just a growth agenda, growth strategy we've had for the last three years and we've been articulating that with investors. We have principally in the Tactical business been a ground radio business and we saw two growth opportunities in adjacencies, one in the airborne side, airborne radios and the other is on systems, tactical systems, communication systems and we've been successful early on across both of those dimensions. We've been winning business on airborne radios, it's on the smallsat terminal, it's a component with ViaSat that's been growing very, very well. We have an opportunity to take our 2-channel handheld radio and embed it into the ARC-201 a radio we got with the Exelis acquisition as well as some capability of providing radios in the aerial tier from Exelis. We see opportunities in doing ground to air data links, that's been a very important growth business for us as well. So this is a good growth opportunity for us as they move and merge between the airborne tier and the ground tier and connecting the two, we think this is going to continue to be sort of a growth vector for Harris in the future certainly even more so with L3. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Josh Sullivan : Just within the space, you mentioned the classified budgets there clearly top-line defense budgets gets most of the focus but what are some of the trends within the classified budgets that you're seeing and what kind of growth is related to your programs, just give little more granularity on that? Bill Brown : Yes, so the last I've seen the they call the national intelligence program, the military intelligence programs the NIP and MIP total about $81 billion, it's up couple of percent from last year, it's been growing over the last three or four years again these budgets tend to be a little bit more resilient more well funded, they are generally classified, we don't get a lot of data across the individual spending, a line item certainly not that we can talk in a open community. But basically what we've seen are more funding going towards those things that we've been putting our money and turning on against in terms of IRAD and that is towards like things like smallsat. That's an area that has been we have seen increasing growth in the intelligence budgets and we're getting the benefit of that, a lot more money into the broad category of space superiority. So how we protect your brand architecture that we happen to have and we've seen over the last three or four years, our space superiority business grow, I talked a bit about some opportunity we won recently on counter communications. So there's opportunities in that space as well and as well on our ground adjacencies, this is capabilities to find ways of gathering information where becomes harder to gather over time. And that -- those are the kind of things that the where the budgets are moving from a classified perspective and it's the areas that we've been focused on internally within the company over the last four or five years as well. Josh Sullivan : And then just on the smallsat topic, you did three launches here, I believe you mentioned 17 orders on hand, what's the pace of launches going forward and then maybe what does the overall pipeline look like? Bill Brown : Yes, so we'll see probably later on this calendar year, I know there is series of launches that still need to be determined is going to be based on when they get to the customer or when the customer secures a right for those particular smallsat that would be part of some other mission. So that will be determined but it will happen over the next one to two years probably and as we prove out our ability to successfully launch these satellites and for them to perform and provide really terrific capabilities, I think that's going to build credibility and I think you'll see much better cadence here. So we're starting from 10s and now going to hundreds. The constellation will be in the hundreds not in the 10s or 20s. So we do see over time that that could be a very big opportunity for the company again it starts slow and we have to prove out our ability and the customers ability to manage these capabilities on a smaller platform. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question. Pete Skibitski : Good morning guys, great quarter, great growth. Hey Bill, just a follow-up on that last question, it seems like all of the big contractors are getting into the smallsat arena in some fashion, do you see you guys kind of in the leaves there or you being kind of keeping a few different competitors in the running to keep its options open, I'm just curious as to how that market is kind of unfolding given it sounds like it's going to be pretty substantial? Bill Brown : Well, I think it's going to be substantial and you're right, I think a lot of other players are pushing into that area, it's not like launching a Nanosatellite or your CubeSat, there's a lot more specific capabilities that are provided we're offering. It's not our bus we're securing the satellite bus from another vendor it's more the bus itself is more commodity like it's really around the capabilities are embedded on the platform, the response of payloads, the antennas, the capability there how you up and download information, how you manage it, so there's a lot more sophistication, so these are pretty technologically advanced small satellites, I think we're probably year or two in the lead. We have a few that are operating, so that gives us some credibility but at the end of the day the team has to continue to work hard to advance the technology, continue to drive cost down embed more capability on to these small satellites and that's what the team is really focused on doing that. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining the call. Any additional questions please feel free to get in touch with me. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Harris Corporation's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anurag Maheshwari, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Anurag Maheshwari : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. On the call with me today is Bill Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Rahul Ghai, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. First, a few words on forward-looking statements. Discussions today will include forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. These statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and Harris SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, which is www.harris.com, where a replay of this call also will be available.  With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. William Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Anurag, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported strong third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share up 30% to $2.11 on revenue growth of 11%, the highest top line growth we've seen in 8 years. Overall, company margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.7%, and free cash flow improved by over $250 million compared to the third quarter of last year. These results extend our exceptional year-to-date performance with non-GAAP earnings per share over the first 3 quarters up 26% on 10% revenue growth and free cash flow up 75% to $788 million. The highlight again this quarter was our accelerating top line growth, a double-digit increase after 3 quarters of high single-digit increases with strong growth in all 3 segments and continued solid operating performance. Quarter momentum remained strong with a book to bill of 1.03 for the quarter and 1.1 for the first 3 quarters with total company-funded backlog up 15% over last year.  These results demonstrated relentless focus on day-to-day execution by our team in the midst of integration planning, and I want to especially recognize and applaud their efforts. With the approval from both L3 and Harris shareholders and Harris signing a definitive agreement to divest our Night Vision business, we remain on track to close the merger in mid-calendar 2019.  Let me start by first providing some details on the quarter performance before closing our prepared remarks with some additional color on the merger. So turning to Slide 4 in the webcast. Communications Systems revenue grew double digits for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 19%, driven by solid growth in DoD Tactical Communications and Public Safety.  DoD Tactical delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 55% driven by more than $100 million of modernization revenue from the Army, Marine Corps and SOCOM. This ramp in modernization, combined with strong readiness demand in the first quarter, has driven year-to-date DoD Tactical revenue growth of 28%. With 100% of Q4 revenue and backlog, we now expect DoD revenue to be up mid-20% versus the prior expectation of low 20% growth at mid-teens when we started the year. International Tactical is flat for the quarter as the ramp of Australia modernization program, early adoption of multichannel products in Canada and ongoing counterterrorism support in the Middle East were offset by a tough compare in Eastern Europe. With Tactical -- International Tactical revenue up 4% for the first 3 quarters, 70% of Q4 revenue in backlog and increasing demand for multichannel products, we're confident that International will go low to mid-single digits in fiscal '19.  And we continue to execute well on our tactical radio strategy, win all DoD ground radio modernization programs, leverage platform investments to maintain international leadership and expand our addressable market into network systems and airborne. On DoD ground radios, we're at the front end of the Army modernization ramp. And with SOCOM and Marine Corps following close behind, we're expecting strong multiyear growth well supported by the President's recent budget request. In GFY '20, the total tactical radio budget across the services grossed over $1 billion with the Army HMS request at $504 million or about 2/3 higher than GFY '19. We're expecting another LRIP on both the HMS manpack and 2-channel radio this summer, reflecting the Army's commitment to ramp from low-rate to full-rate production after the Operational Test in 2020. For the SOCOM 2-channel handheld program, we've completed the operational user acceptance test and received a $39 million production order in the quarter as we progress toward full-rate production. And finally from the Marine Corps, we received an initial order for HF and multichannel manpack radio, solidifying our incumbent position as they begin their modernization effort. All of these programs are well supported in the fight with a tactical budget request once again growing by more than $1 billion to $7.3 billion over the next 5 years. The successful launch of our multichannel products and recent U.S. DoD wins have driven faster international adoption than we expected. In the quarter, we received an order from the Canadian Armed Forces as part of their multiyear modernization program, and we're selected by the special forces of 2 other NATO countries to supply 2-channel radios as they standardize on Harris in support of NATO and U.S. coalition interoperability. And we continue to have a strong pipeline of opportunities across Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East looking to refresh their large Harris-installed base of about 100 -- 350,000 radios with next-generation products. And for the third prong of our strategy, to expand in the broader network systems, we recorded a win a New Zealand, leveraging our radio incumbency position. And we're selected as the prime systems integrator to modernize and upgrade their command and control network. This win builds on prior successes in Australia, UAE and other Middle Eastern and Asia Pacific countries as we open our aperture and provide more complete mission solutions. And then finally in March, we received our first international order for airborne radios on the Apache platform for a Middle East customer, opening a new market opportunity for us. This strategic win will help us expand in other air platforms in the region and increase our share of wallet with international customers as we grow our addressable market from ground to airborne radios. Overall for the first three quarters, Tactical revenue grew 14% with a book to bill of 1.1, resulting in a 21% year-over-year backlog increase to over $1 billion. With strong growth in DoD Tactical and another quarter of double-digit growth in Public Safety, we're raising Communications Systems revenue guidance to be up about 12% for the year versus prior guidance of up 10% to 11%.  In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 7% from continued strong growth at avionics and electronic warfare as they continued to execute well on long-term platforms, the F-35, the F/A-18 and the F-16. Order momentum remained strong as well with ES, recording the seventh consecutive quarter with a book to bill greater than 1.  In electronic warfare, we received a $212 million contract to upgrade electronic countermeasure capabilities for U.S. Navy and Kuwaiti F/A-18s. This is our largest order to date on the F/A-18 platform, solidifying a 20-plus year relationship and bringing total contract value to $2 billion. In avionics, we were awarded a $129 million contract for the development phase of the open systems' integrated core processor on the F-35. This strategic win, combined with previous awards to provide the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display, make us an integral part of the Tech Refresh #3 program and position us well for future opportunities on the F-35 platform. We've also leveraged our open-architecture technology and were selected to provide a processor for the newly redesigned trainer in MQ-25 platforms. We believe these wins provide us with a head start at open systems design and a foundation to build upon as additional platforms move towards a nonproprietary solution.  In the C4i business in the UAE, following the successful completion of the initial operating capability phase of the ELTS program, we were awarded a contract to provide tech support and training to the Armed Forces. This is an important milestone in this $1 billion-plus opportunity, which includes full operational capability across 5 army brigades, tactical radios and networking systems for other military services.  Year-to-date, Electronic Systems revenue was up 7% and book to bill was 1.2. With strong backlog and progress made in compressing the cycle time in our factory and our supply chain to accelerate the delivery capability to our customers, we're increasing Electronic Systems revenue guidance to up about 8.5% versus prior guidance of up 7% to 8%. Finally, in Space and Intelligence Systems, revenue was up 7% as mid-teens growth in the classified business from the ramp of smallsat's exquisite systems and next-generation technology more than offset the headwinds on environmental programs. Order strength was broad-based across classified, environmental and other civil programs, resulting in a segment book to bill of greater than 1.  In classified, we received more than $400 million in orders, once again up double digits, as we leverage investments in innovation and strong customer relationships to strengthen our incumbency and increase our share of wallet with existing customers. In civil, we strengthened our position as a trusted mission partner on long-standing environmental programs and on GPS. And in environmental, we received a $293 million 3-year contract extension for NOAA's GOES-R ground system program, increasing the total contract value to $1.7 billion. This brings book to bill on environmental programs to 1.4 for the first 3 quarters and reinforces our confidence that the environmental business will return to growth next year. On the GPS program, our investment in a 100% digital mission data unit has extended our 40-year partner of-choice position and resulted in a $243 million award for the first 2 of 22 space vehicles under the sole-sourced GPS III follow-on contract.  For Space and Intel, year-to-date performance was strong with revenue up 7% and with nearly all of Q4 revenue in backlog and high confidence for follow-on opportunities, we now expect revenue growth of about 7% for the segment, at the high end of our previous guidance range of up 6% to 7%.  With our strong year-to-date performance, improving business outlook and growing backlog, we're once again increasing guidance across all metrics with company revenue now expected to be up about 9% versus previous guidance of up 8% to 8.5%, earnings per share of $8.15 and free cash flow of approximately $1.025 billion.  So now let me turn over to Rahul to cover financial results in more detail before I close with a few comments on the merger. Rahul? Rahul Ghai : Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everyone. Discussions today are on a non-GAAP basis, excluding out the deal and integration costs and onetime adjustments in the prior year.  Turning now to the total company results on Slide 5. Revenue was up 11% in the third quarter and earnings before interest and taxes increased 15% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 80 basis points to 19.7%. EPS grew double digits for the sixth consecutive quarter to $2.11, and free cash flow increased 3x to $379 million as we reduced 12 days of working capital driven by structural improvements, resulting in a more linear cash flow through the year. We also repaid $300 million of debt in the quarter, completing the last tranche of planned debt repayment, enabling us to return future cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Year-to-date revenue was up 10% and earnings before interest and taxes increased 15% with margin expansion of 90 basis points to 19.6%. Free cash flow was robust in the first 3 quarters at $788 million, a 75% increase over the prior year and was approximately $1.25 billion over the last 12 months.  Turning to the third quarter EPS bridge on Slide 6. Year-over-year, EPS grew by 13% or $0.49. Of this, $0.30 of growth came from higher volume and solid program execution, which was partially offset by product and program mix. A lower tax rate, including benefit from tax reform, contributed $0.19.  Segment details on Slide 7. Communication Systems third quarter revenue was $568 million, up 19% versus the prior year. In addition to strong growth in Tactical, revenue was up double digits in Public Safety as the business continue to gain traction with federal and state agencies. Operating income for the segment was up 19% with strong margin at 30.3% from volume and operational efficiencies, partially offset by product and program mix. Year-to-date, segment revenue was up 15% with strong growth across all 3 businesses, and operating income increased 17%. Operating margin was up 80 basis points to 30.1% and year-to-date book to bill was 1.1. Historical information for Tactical orders, revenue and backlog is included as supplemental information at the end of this presentation. Electronic Systems on Slide 8. Revenue was up 7% driven by growth in avionics and electronic warfare partially offset by transition on the ELTS program from initial to full operational capability. Segment operating income increased 14% to $123 million, and margin expanded 120 basis points to 19% from increased volume and strong operational performance. In addition to strength on long-term platforms, F-35, F-18 and F-16, double-digit growth in weapons release systems led to year-to-date segment revenue growth of 7% and operating income increased 13%. Operating margin was up 90 basis points to 19.1% and year-to-date book to bill was 1.2. In Space and Intelligence Systems on Slide 9, third quarter revenue was $514 million, up 7%, and operating income grew 5% to $87 million from higher volume and strong program execution partially offset by higher investments in R&D and selling expenses. Year-to-date segment revenue increased 7% with continued growth in classified programs partially offset by a decline in environmental revenue. Operating income increased 6%, and operating margins remained strong at 17.5%. Year-to-date book to bill was 1.1.  Moving to Slides 10 and 11 for full year guidance. As Bill mentioned, given a strong year-to-date performance, we now expect revenue to be up approximately 9% versus the prior guidance of up 8% to 8.5%, reflecting strength in all 3 segments. We're increasing EPS guidance to approximately $8.15 or by $0.20 from the midpoint of prior guidance of $7.90 to $8. Higher volume is expected to contribute $0.11 of this increase with lower tax rate contributing the remaining $0.09. EPS now is expected to be up approximately 28% for the year with about 60% of the growth coming from operations and a balanced 40% from lower share count and the benefit of a lower tax rate.  We're also increasing free cash flow guidance to approximately $1.025 billion versus the prior guidance range of $1 billion to $1.025 billion driven by higher earnings. In fiscal '17 and '18, over 50% of free cash was generated in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we have made structural working capital improvements to smoothen cash generation through the year, resulting in about 25% of the expected fiscal '19 free cash guidance to be generated in the fourth quarter.  We expect to end fiscal '19 with working capital of 43 days, a 2-day improvement over fiscal '18 and a 35-day improvement since the Exelis acquisition. Tax rate guidance is now approximately 15.5% versus approximately 16.5% previously, but half of the one point reduction was due to lower international tax primarily from increased FDII benefits and the other half from additional tax planning.  Switching to segment outlook. In Communication Systems, we now expect revenue to be up approximately 12% versus up 10% to 11% previously driven by strength in DoD Tactical and Public Safety. In Electronic Systems, we now expect revenue to be up approximately 8.5% versus up 7% to 8% previously driven by strong growth on long-term platforms. In Space, Intelligence, we now expect revenue to be up approximately 7%, at the high end of the previous guidance range of up 6% to 7% from continued momentum in the classified business. Margins for all 3 segments are expected to be at the midpoint of the previous guidance ranges, approximately 30% in Communication Systems, 19% in Electronic Systems and 17.5% in Space and Intelligence.  And with that, I would like to turn it back to Bill for his closing remarks. William Brown : Okay. Well, thanks, Rahul. We're now in the homestretch of fiscal '19 and performing very well and better than our S-4 projections across all metrics : revenue, margin and cash flow, and we're on track for a record year. President's budget request for GFY '20 and beyond is a real positive for Harris and the programs that we support, especially in strategic growth areas where we invested in R&D over the past several years and have strong customer positions. In addition to tactical radio budgets, long-term platforms like the F/A-18, the F-35 are well supported and classified space and other IC budgets continue to trend up. And with outlays continuing to lag budget appropriations by more than $100 billion in investment accounts, we expect growth momentum to continue in the medium term.  Alongside our strong operating performance and execution, integration planning is progressing well. The team over the last 6 months has made significant progress in outlining an operational road map for the combined company to ensure seamless transition on day 1. They're also developing detailed capture plans to achieve the $500 million of cost synergies and, though still early, have identified more than 100 ideas on potential revenue synergies. Chris and I meet -- remain very closely connected with the integration team through our weekly meetings, and we're very pleased with the progress that they made to date. I'm also pleased with the outcome of the divestiture of Night Vision, which we proactively initiated to address potential regulatory concerns. You'll recall this business was operating at breakeven with declining revenue when we acquired it with Exelis. And through aggressive actions, we transformed it into a mid-teens margins business, growing at double digits, resulting in a $350 million sale price, well above the implied value when we bought Exelis.  This same relentless focus on operational excellence is clearly demonstrated in a track record of margin expansion at Harris, and we expect to leverage and build on this OpEx muscle in a new L3 Harris to capture integration savings, improve underperforming businesses and drive long-term productivity gains. Overall, I'm increasingly encouraged and confident that this transformative combination will create substantial long-term value for employees, our customers and our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good results, guys. First question, I guess more broadly speaking, revenue guidance moved up but margin guidance was maintained. When we think about programs driving upside across the business, how does this convert to profit growth or operating leverage for standalone Harris? Rahul Ghai : So as we look at margin expansion driven by the revenue growth, clearly, we've said that before, that this year in Communication Systems is a transition year for us as we ramp three new products : the Army handout, the SOCOM handout and the Army manpack. So as we work up the production ramp and take out costs, which we've got a great track record previously, We took out 47% of costs, for example, in the 117G post introduction, we're confident that Communication Systems margins will continue to trend up.  Same thing in Electronic Systems. We've done well taking out costs this year. We guided to 18.5% at the beginning of the year. We increased it to 19%. We had a plus sign in the guidance range. 80% of this business is fixed price. We will continue to drive margins in Electronic Systems as well, but the volume is a headwind especially as the growth is coming from long-term platform. So I think Communications Systems and Electronic Systems should drive margin expansion in the future years. William Brown : And just if I could add here, Sheila, we said this year we'd see -- it's a little bit of margin expansion fiscal '19, not because of segment margin expansion but more because of the mix shifting to higher-margin businesses, CS and ES, that we'd grow faster. We've even seen more of that this year on top of some margin expansion in ES. So as we look into the back end of the year, we can see ourselves touching 20% margin in the fourth quarter and we see some expansion in margins going into fiscal '20 and beyond. Sheila Kahyaoglu : And then just on CS, strong support for the Tactical business in the budget. How do we think about market share going forward, given upcoming orders for Army manpack and handheld on a best value basis and further implications for the overall tactical market? William Brown : Well, look, we're very pleased with the trajectory of the budgets. They continue to increase, and I'm very pleased to see the Army HMS budget going over $500 million in '20 from about $300 million this past year, $7.3 billion over the next 5 years, which is stronger than we had expected than the President would suggest it even about a year ago. Our market share has remained very, very robust. We're on all the contract vehicles. We continue to compete well. We're going to continue to win and gain share through the investments we make to continue to advance our radio, take costs out, add functionality, improve waveforms in the radios. And that's how we expect to win and continue to have a large share of market in DoD and perhaps gain some share over time. So we -- the outlook is very, very strong in DoD radio, Sheila. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Robert Stallard : Bill, just a quick question on the merger situation here. When do you expect to announce the next layer of management for the combined company? William Brown : Rob, we're going to -- we'll be fully prepared to announce the management structure several levels down, plus our Board, as we get closer to the closing. So probably towards the end of June. Robert Stallard : Okay. And then as a follow-up, again on the merger situation. You highlighted the very strong cash flow performance on the working capital days that you see. Do you see this achievement being applicable to the combined company? And what sort of scale are we now looking at there? William Brown : Yes. Well, clearly, we've -- as Rahul pointed out in his prepared remarks, since we bought Exelis, we brought down working capital days by 35 days. We'll end the year at 43, very, very positive trajectory. I think on a combined basis, at -- assuming we -- if we combine the end of March with this past month, I think the combined days was 70 days. So we see a lot of opportunity between the 2 companies. We're estimating 6 to 7 days over the next several years at $35 million a day. But clearly, there's some opportunity beyond that.  Chris and his team are working hard on this. They're making good progress. We're really getting into the details of where that working capital happens to be, putting plans in place. So Rob, if anything, I think Chris and I are more confident today than we were 3 or 6 months ago that we've got good working capital improvements ahead of us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Carter Copeland : Just Bill, I wondered if you could maybe comment on -- if you look at the book to bill, obviously the most recent ones are lower than what you saw in the preceding quarters. But obviously, the budget activity has been strong. Just -- I wonder if you could give us some color on the funnel of opportunities that you're looking at behind the bookings we've seen lately and if there's any material difference from what we've seen over the last 18 months or so, which has been very strong. William Brown : Yes. I mean good question, Carter. No fundamental or material difference. Year-to-date book to bill was -- is very strong at 1.1. We've had 5 consecutive quarters above 1. Backlog is -- as we pointed out in our remarks, is up 15% year-over-year. It's up over 20% in the Tactical business. It's up 25% over the last couple of years. So the backlog is actually quite strong. We expect book to bill for the year to be more than 1. So I think it's all good news. The pipeline for the Harris as a total company is at $32 billion across the 3 segments. It's very resilient. The budgets, I think, are well supportive of growth into the future. We've raised our guidance now 3x this year. We've had $420 million above the S-4 revenues. So every indication is we continue to see good growth opportunities into the future. Rahul Ghai : And Carter, if I may add, the 1.03 book to bill that Bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, that's the funded book to bill. If you include the unfunded portion of the awards we received in the quarter, we are at 1.3 book to bill for the quarter. And given the only other data point I would throw out there is that the backlog is up 15% year-over-year, as Bill mentioned, and 12% since we started the fiscal year, so good growth in backlog. Carter Copeland : That's great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Bill, you mentioned it quickly, but the thought process around revenue synergies. I just wonder as you get another quarter under your belt and we get close to closure, just if you could share your thoughts on the intersection of the Harris' capabilities and L3's capabilities and how that's evolving and what we should expect to see here, places you're excited about. Any color there would be helpful. William Brown : Yes. That's a very good question. I mean everyday that Chris and I interact with the teams on -- as they get together and share information, brainstorm both in the open area as well as in the classified area, we're getting more and more encouraged about the set of opportunities ahead of us. It's still premature to calibrate that or quantify it or say how much time it's going to take to achieve it. Some will require some R&D investment to occur. We see -- it's all the same -- anything happened with Exelis, it was probably a couple of years in until we really started to see meaningful revenue synergies. But we're seeing it in a couple of different areas. We've got a great position now staked out in smallsats. Both L3 and Harris have good expertise in optical and RF payloads, SATCOM, mission knowledge, very strong L3 data link capabilities, [indiscernible] capability. I think when you combine it, we think we'll have a much more holistic, much more competitive offering in smallsats. And I think that's very encouraging. We've talked in the past about data links. L3 is very strong on the airborne side. We're strong on the ground side. I think that's going to be very interesting.  The other area that's been, I think, of note recently is -- L3 has a very strong multifunction phased array capability. We've got strength in open-system architecture back in EW processing. Good capability as well in phased arrays. But that multifunction that L3 brings and some of the open architecture that we have is really game-changing in our view. And it's not just from current platform, but also new and new evolving platforms.  So those are some of the ideas and some of the things we're thinking about. Obviously, the small SWaP EW product that we've had on the market for a couple of years, it's now starting to take hold. Lots of opportunities to embed that small SWaP EW into some of the unmanned systems that L3 has and that they -- that their system integrator on. So there's more than 100 different ideas. Those are the ones they've got -- come on top of mind. But the energy, the excitement when people talk about these is palpable, and we're very optimistic about this. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : A couple of questions. First, Bill, I was hoping you could expand upon the airborne radio opportunity and maybe just more broadly speak about the foreign and domestic ROS Tactical pipelines and how they may have changed with the airborne kind of opportunity now more [indiscernible]. William Brown : Well, the pipeline itself are very strong. I mean it's very resilient for the DoD at still around $2.6 billion. It's kind of in line with where we were before in the last couple of quarters, and it's been very stable. On the DoD size is about $1.6 billion, shifting more towards modernization. So now it's almost a 50-50 split between base and modernization, but up year-over-year by about 13%. So again, given the strong orders over the course of the last year across Tactical, the fact that the pipeline for that business remains as resilient as it is, I think, is very encouraging, I think testament to what the team has been doing.  On the airborne radio side, I'm very optimistic about this. This kind of goes back 3 years or so. It's been a lot of investment we made with Exelis. They had a position on airborne platforms and -- but it was an older product offering. And a lot of the new product offerings that we're putting in place, the 2-channel offerings on the ground side, have capability that can be embedded on the airborne side. As you know, we're also partner with ViaSat on the STT. We've seen really good growth this year on airborne radios and the Small Tactical Terminal. So -- I mean I'm very encouraged about this. And the fact that we had a first opportunity here in the Middle Eastern country on a small number of Apaches, where they have a very large fleet, I think, is a big win for us. It's not big in dollars, but the opportunity set ahead of us is pretty substantial.  I think this will grow over time. I won't be able to quantify it today. But I think it'll grow over time. And again, it's in -- it's along the path of the growth beyond that simple ground business that we've been in, that we've been pushing out for the last several years. Gautam Khanna : And my follow-up would be just if you could talk a little bit about how you've -- you've mentioned how you work together with L3 in advance of the merger closing. But if you could just talk about what, operationally, maybe you guys have offered in terms of help to L3. They had a traveling wave tube issue a couple -- a quarter ago that didn't seem to recur in today's results. How do you guys been kind of working together operationally ahead of the deal so that there are no surprises once it actually starts to combine. William Brown : Yes. No, what -- yes. Thanks, Gautam, for the question. Look, our integration teams are really focused on the integration value, so how we can combine our spend and leverage that, bring that down. We've done a number of should-cost analyses. We've got a very good and robust listing of what we buy, who we buy it from, what we price, we pay. It's done in a clean team, so we don't have visibility to that. But the clean team is coming up with great ideas and actually developing and negotiating packages so that when we close, day 1, we can start executing against that. We see opportunities on the indirect side, facilities we've had. Our combined operational leadership teams going out and visiting many of our sites to understand what the combination of -- what the facility consolidation opportunities might be.  I know Chris is very, very deep in what's happening at the traveling wave tube business. I'm sure he'll speak about that later on this morning. He's put a lot of resources there, a lot of focused attention. We're aware of it. We see some metrics coming out of it. We're providing guidance and assistance where we can. But Chris is doing a great job in getting his arms around this, and I think you'll see stability and eventually some improvement here.  So I think together, as a combined company, the operational muscle that we both will bring and I think what we honed here at Harris over a number of years, I think we'll continue to see this L3-Harris business perform like I think we have done at Harris over the last 5 or 6 years. So I'm very optimistic about that, Gautam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Spingarn : So I have a question, Bill, for you on growth that speaks a little bit to what we've already talked about, and then I have one for Rahul on cash. But Bill, you're now targeting 9% growth for this year. L3 is at 6%. You both had among the best numbers growth-wise this quarter, and you talked about the budgets supporting further growth in the medium term. But would you say that the new L3-Harris can be the sector top line growth later well into the future? Or is this a peak-ish kind of year, just given those strong budgets over the past couple of years? William Brown : Look, I don't see that fiscal '19 is a peak-ish kind of year. I see -- again, it's a little soon to comment on the growth potential of the combined companies. You'll see L3's results. They've knocked the cover off the ball this quarter. They took their guidance up for the year as did we. Between the 2 companies, we're $274 million, $275 million above the S-4, even more if you look at where they're guiding to this year.  So the combined -- the companies independently are performing better than expected. The budget outlook is better than we have thought. Our opportunity set, as we think about revenue synergies, is more encouraging to us. We'll be more competitive as an enterprise because we'll take costs out, be able to bid aggressively, attack businesses, be it more of a full mission provider. So if anything, I'm more encouraged about the growth trajectory beyond fiscal '19. I would not call it peak-ish. But I do see us doing, I think, quite well as a combined entity once we close and kind of get on with this. So I think it feels pretty good. Robert Spingarn : Okay. And then on cash, Rahul, the two of you, the two companies have about $1.4 billion pro forma on the balance sheet, cash, and so you've targeted $2 billion for share repurchases in the first 12 months post close. But given what's on hand and what you're going to generate in the meantime, it seems that you'll end that first year with a lot of excess cash. So I know you're limited in your ability to buy back even more stock in year 1. So should we think about this cash build as giving you more firepower for repurchases in year 2? Or might you do something else with that cash? Rahul Ghai : No. Absolutely, Rob. We've said this before. I mean post close, our priority -- we've done with the debt repayment. With the sale of our Night Vision business, as even that closes, we're going to prefund the combined L3-Harris pension. And with that, Harris standalone pension is prefunded till 2025; L3 pension, should that be funded, till about '22 based on the modeling that we have done. So the pension should be funded with no near-term funding requirements.  And that would -- and we've said -- M&A, it won't be if it's absolutely critical. So all excess cash should go back to shareholders whether in form of dividends or share buyback. And dividends, we've kind of thought, I think, between 30% to 35% of our free cash. So that leaves a lot of firepower for share buyback. And we should keep -- we should need to keep about $500 million in the balance sheet. So all excess cash back -- goes back to shareholders. William Brown : And I would just add, I think you know our debt ratios quite well. So we don't have any debt payments in the near term either or the medium term, Rahul. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Richard Safran : Generally, I'd like to ask you for defense. We're seeing a lot of programs transition from development to production, and I wanted to ask you about the DoD classified and unclassified contracting environment that you're seeing versus what you may have been expecting. For example, as programs transition to production, are you seeing a more favorable contracting environment? And if possible in your answer, could you comment directionally on how contracting may impact your margins going forward? William Brown : Look, it's a pretty broad question. I think in general, we're seeing opportunities put on contract a little bit faster than it would've been a year or 2 ago. In terms of the way things are being done, that -- it's not changing all that much in terms of mix, cost plus fixed price, encouragement to industry to invest in IRAD. As you know, Richard, there's been a conversation around contracts financing. That still is out on the horizon. I think there was an attempt to change contract finance structure back in September of last year. This is still an open discussion.  But I don't really see substantive changes in terms of anything that's kind of generalized with either classified or none that would impact margin structure going forward. Our margins in the classified side, they're typically -- more typically, they're cost plus, and they tend to come with cost-plus margins as I think that's what you'd see on the cost plus side. That's not really -- or the classified side. But I don't see that changing much here at all. Rahul, I don't know if you have a... Rahul Ghai : No. I think you're right. And I think even with everything else that's going on, I think we're growing margins this year. All segment margins are expanding in all 3 segments and, in response to Sheila's question, to kind of provide a little bit of forward-looking statements on our expected margins going forward. Richard Safran : Okay. Just quick follow-up here, just on the classified backlog growth. I thought I'd ask if you could comment on how quickly you see classified revenues grow -- growing relative to unclassified part of the business. And on that part of the business, are you finding margins for classified wins at/or above standard margins? And do you think that the trends that you're seeing in the classified programs are going to impact you positively in '20? William Brown : Well, first of all, the classified business over the last couple of years has gone very, very well for us. Our bookings continue to be very strong in the mid-teens rate, book to bill is over 1, revenue up in the double-digit mid-teens level, has been very, very good and has been over the last couple of years. It's an exquisite systems. It's in small satellites. It's in ground adjacencies. In these areas, we really can't talk much more about, but it's pretty broad-based. And I think it reflects a drive that we've had over the last number of years that to invest in technology and to move from providing components to subsystems to now more complete mission solutions, and that's been a multiyear journey for us. And we're seeing our growth, our position, our share increasing as the budgets are inflecting. I think that's what's driving positive growth for us. In terms of the margins on that business, a lot of it -- some of it is fixed price. But much of it is because you're pushing the envelope of technology, much is going to come more in a cost-plus side. They come with slightly more compressed margins.  But as we look out at the next couple of years, I see our Space business, where a lot of the classified business happens to be, it's also on ES, but a lot's in Space, I see it holding the margins in that area as we continue to drive productivity, take out cost, take out costs and the pieces are not classified or a fixed price and absorb the mix differential as the classified business grows a bit. So I'm not terribly concerned about that. I think it's very good business. In fact, some of the technology that you develop in the classified world does help your business over time in unclassified. So it's terrific business, and we're pleased to be a strong player there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Myles Walton : Bill, I think it sounded like you're kind of confident on the turn in the environmental headwinds Space, Intel. So I'm just curious, can you size kind of what you had to absorb this year in your fiscal '19 that you grew 7% in spite of that and then just confirm that you don't see that as a headwind year-on-year into '20 and maybe what that outlook is from there? William Brown : Yes. Look, we've -- this year, our environmental business, I mean it's kind of in the range of $270 million or so, like little less than $300 million, is down mid-teens in size. We do believe it's troughing here this year. The book to bill, as I mentioned in my remarks, was about 1.4. So it's -- the book to bill has been good. The backlog is obviously up. We see '20 to at least be flat with '19 and perhaps a little bit of growth there and beyond. We've gone through some budget pressures here over the last couple of years.  We continue to see things put on order for NOAA. It's GOES-R ground modernization, that we're seeing some opportunities there. We're seeing opportunities in -- over time, in U.S. and international centers. We've launched 5 satellites, five instruments in the last 12 months. These things go in phases. So as they launch, you have both U.S. and international customers starting to look at developing the next-generation instruments. We sell into Japan, Korea as well -- South Korea as well as here in the States.  So we're seeing opportunities to grow at adjacencies on RF spectrum management, DoD weather, thermal detection. So we're seeing a number of different things here that indicate to us that '20 should not be another set-down, and perhaps there should be opportunities beyond that. And that basically sizes that business. Myles Walton : So could Space and Intel be your fastest growing or at least the business that's accelerating the most into 2020? William Brown : I think it's too soon to say right now. We're going to come back and give you some guidances in early August as we close the year. It has been -- as you could tell, it's been a headwind for us over the last couple of years and certainly into fiscal '19. But we've got to look at the whole portfolio, in the outlook, on the budgets and how it's going to roll into our business. I wouldn't say it's going to be the highest grower, but I think it should be a pretty healthy grower over the next several years. Last time we provided medium-term guidance, we've said it would be mid-single digits, and we'll come back and revisit that come early August. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : So I wanted to ask a little bit about the tactical radios. It looks like, probably on a DoD side, be up to somewhere in the $660 million or something like that range for this year. When you think about what the growth drivers are in terms of the key programs that we know that you're on, the key growth drivers in 2020 within DoD Tactical. William Brown : Well, look, I think as we go from here, the growth drivers are going to be modernization. It's going to be the Marine Corps ramp, Army ramp, both on the handheld and the manpack. We'll see SOCOM continuing to grow. Those will be the principal drivers. I mean your numbers are in the ballpark here in fiscal '19 on DoD. If you go back just two years, in '17, it's up about 2/3. The budget has been up about 2/3 in that period of time. But what's interesting and what's I think very encouraging here, Seth, as you go out the next 2 to 3 years, the budget's grow by another 2/3. So they touch $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion a couple of years out. And when you just look at -- even holding constant share, if those budgets happen, we would see that business continuing to grow pretty substantially and probably touch on $1 billion three years out. So if anything, we remain very encouraged about the growth outlook in DoD Tactical. Seth Seifman : Okay. And then in the -- I guess in the Electronics Systems, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the -- do you observe any changes in the competitive environment? I mean that's a place where just about all of the defense primes and some others play. There's a lot of new work out there. Some are growing really fast, some less fast, everybody wants to grow. Can you talk about any changes you've observed in that competitive environment, if there are any? William Brown : Well, look, I mean yes, these things are shifting. It's not over weeks or months. It's over several years. And I think what we try to point out here in various investor meetings is that we've invested in new technologies over the last 3, 4, 5 years, in open-systems architecture, and that has matured itself. It's such a place where we won the open-system mission processor for the F-35, the brain of the F-35, which is a very, very big win. It's a multiyear platform, and we feel very good about that. That was a competitive win. We're also leveraging our open systems technology into other new platforms that -- at Boeing, the T-X and the MQ-25. You can imagine in the drive towards nonproprietary solutions. There are other platforms that are looking at this. Certainly, next-gen platforms will be open system. Even some opportunities on the F-18 to drive open systems, we've done that a couple of years ago. We've also made a lot of investments in electronic warfare over the last 3 or 4 years, moving to software-defined EW with better capabilities.  And those investments, I think, are positioning this company in a spot where we're growing on those long-term platforms. And we're growing and we're going at a faster rate than, I believe, others in areas because I believe we're taking share. We continued to perform well, the teams working hard driving -- making sure we're successful here. We continue to execute well.  And as we merge with L3, if anything, the combined capabilities will open up some new opportunities in some areas that we're not really on today. So Seth, it is competitive. The dynamic is shifting, but I think we're well positioned here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Colin Canfield : This is Colin on for John. Can you just update your thoughts on the $3 billion free cash flow target, what you're seeing in existing budgets and combination, international that could either buy us growth either upwards or downwards? William Brown : I think we're feeling as good today as we did before on $3 billion in 3 years. As Rahul mentioned, we're sort of over the last 12 months, over $2 billion of combined cash between us and L3. We see organic growth opportunities both internationally and domestically. We didn't really split those pieces, but we see organic growth driving cash generation. We see that the cash effect of cost synergies kicking in, another 6 or 7 days' worth of working capital, all of which gets us to that $3 billion range.  And if anything, sitting here today, we're more confident about that than we would've been 6 months ago, just given the trajectory since the merger announcement on growth in the company, on working capital improvements, on the things that we're all talking about in terms of prefunding pension which eliminates cash flow contribution several years out. So if anything, we feel better today on achieving $3 billion three years out. Colin Canfield : Got it. And then if you could just talk a little bit about modernization trends that you're seeing among NATO partners, in terms of both the NATO and U.S. interoperability. The social forces comment points to pretty constructive trend there. I just want to see in terms of the kind of larger forces what you're seeing. William Brown : Well, it's very -- it's a very good question because we're seeing really good positive trends here. And I think what we see typically is our international partners, starting with the 5 Is and then moving to others, modernize and upgrade capabilities as they see the DoD upgrading with products. And those same products, for example, the 2-channel handheld, eventually starts to find its way into allied nations in -- starting with their special forces and then working into the regular services as well.  And that's a trend that we've seen here in the first couple of quarters of the year, very recently in the last quarter, into Canada, a couple of NATO countries in Europe. We see in Australia as well. So there's a positive momentum behind modernization. As you know, 1.5 years ago, we won a very large contract in Australia. We're executing well under modernization. So these things are all kind of going in waves. I believe the U.S. DoD, if you see the funding, were the front end of a multiyear modernization ramp. And we're seeing the same thing now starting to occur in various countries around the world. U.K. is a little bit further out. It's probably 2 or 3 years out with the Morpheus program, which is the upgrade or modernization of the Bowman program. Just given some of the Brexit concern, I think that might have moved a little bit. But the reality, that's still out in the horizon. And we'll be a good player in all of those different competitions because of the strength of the product offering and the maturity of the product offering that we have here with the DoD. Rahul Ghai : Colin, the only thing I'd add there is that if you look at our radio business, our investment in Europe is up more than 50% this year primarily driven by the modernization and some of the allied nations buying our radio products. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : A couple of quick questions. Bill, just to follow up on international radios. You gave a lot of great qualitative color. Any view directionally on how that business goes in fiscal '20? It's always kind of opaque for us, I think. William Brown : Well, it's a little bit too soon to kind of call what '20 is going to look like. I'd like to complete fiscal '19, and we'll provide some deeper guidance as we see some trends evolving beyond that. Just this year, it's evolving as we had expected. We're going to be up low to mid-single digits. The first half was up 7%. The back half is flat. We're up 4% year-to-date. On the full year basis, we see up -- Asia Pacific up mid-single digits mainly because of the Australia ramp. We see Europe up mid-single digits, which is a positive outcome. Rahul just mentioned about what's happening in Western Europe. It's offsetting a decline in Eastern Europe as we had thought would happen. MEA, Middle East, Africa is about flat. Africa has been a strong market for us this year. We likely will see continued trends that are strong in Africa going into next year. CALA and Central Asia have both been relatively weak, but they're relatively small base. We do expect in '20 and beyond, those start to rebound. We see some good signals coming out of Brazil and Mexico about growth outlooks. We're seeing more positive news come out of Afghanistan because of the U.S. pullout -- anticipated pullout and the need to build their forces and equip their forces. There's some more -- likely, we'll see growth in Afghanistan. So we'll see some things shift around. This year, again, playing out as we expected, and I think we'll see sort of some of the same trends into next year. Peter Skibitski : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my last one. How are you guys thinking about the length and magnitude of the headwind from this UAE program transitioning? William Brown : Well, this year, it's down quite a bit because -- and it was expected it would be down. There's a gap between initial operating capability and the full operating capability, which is moving from the one brigade to now another 4, so total of 5. And then there'll be other services, could be radios coming along. So we expect that to be a growth driver in fiscal '20. But we saw a little bit of a headwind here this year because of that particular transition.  The good news here is that the team has been doing exceptionally well here. The program has gone very well. The mission readiness exercise that was done with this one brigade towards the beginning of our fiscal year was very successful. Our reputation in UAE is very, very strong. If anything, we're more encouraged today about $1 billion total opportunity in the UAE than we would've been a year or so ago. So a little bit of transition here in fiscal '19 that we're absorbing, and we'll see the turnaround drive to growth in fiscal '20. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Joshua Sullivan : So you mentioned more open systems competitions going forward. Can you talk about your historical win rates on open platforms? Maybe JTRS comes to mind. But as the market evolves in that direction, just be curious to hear Harris' historical win rate in that environment. William Brown : Well, it's target, call it, win rate because they're very different markets, and it really is just an evolving one. I think the big open system competition, the one that's truly notable because of how sizable it was, was really on the F-35. And winning that -- that was a multiyear process, started with, I don't know, either 10 different competitors. It was down selected to 3. It was a head-to-head competition, and we won that competition over very, very formidable components and competitors in the space. And the team has just done such a great job with that. We brought great technology, great execution, a good cost structure. That also has allowed us to bridge into other new platforms. It started with some open-systems work we had done over some time at -- on F-18 with Boeing. So I think it's been several years. I think we're winning -- the ones that we're in, I think we're winning the ones that we happen to be on.  If you consider the JTRS platform as an open system, which you can because it's a [indiscernible] protocol in the waveforms, as you've seen over the last 5 years, we've become exceptionally well positioned on JTRS programs. To take you back 6 years or 5 years ago, we weren't even the Program of Record. We weren't even able to compete for the program dollars, and now we're actually competing. We've got -- we're on contracts. We're on programs. We're delivering radio. We're executing well. So I think this company has demonstrated an ability to find a way to win when it goes towards nonproprietary solution. That points to the agility of the company, but also to the willingness to invest ahead of the curve in R&D. And I think they all kind of go hand-in-hand together. Joshua Sullivan : Helpful. And then I just want to ask one on your efforts in robotics. I believe you competed the T7 robot on the CRS program. Is this an area where you see Harris expanding its efforts? And then it would seem there might be some good cross-functionality with L-3. Are they already in your supply chain on the robotics side? William Brown : Well, I don't believe they're in the supply chain on the robotics side, but there could be some opportunities here. I won't comment specifically on that, but there certainly could be. Look, I'm very pleased with what's happened on robotics from just where we were 3 or 4 years ago. As you know, we won the U.K. MoD program with the T7. It was \u00a355 million or about $70 million. I think we've delivered, I don't know, 4 -- 10 units, I think, we delivered into the U.K. They're all performing exceptionally well. We've got a sort of a very strong support by the U.K. MoD as we go around the world and offer the T7. They love the robot. They love the performance of what we've shown. There's another opportunity called Dark Rose in the U.K. It's a smaller robot that we'd be competitive on. We're on the -- we're down selected on the Common Robotic System-Heavy, the CRS-H program in the U.S., which should be awarded sometime this summer. We think we're well positioned on that.  We think globally, the opportunity set is -- could be in the -- close to $1 billion here for robotics. So we're on the front end of this. And I think just the early wins with a strong -- very reputable MoD in the U.K., I think it's very encouraging for us in robotics. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Rahul, you commented on the cash progression through the year. I just want to circle back on that. It looks like the free cash flow guidance [indiscernible] some pretty big step-down in Q4 relative to what you did in Q2 and Q3. It looks like it assumed some sort of working capital drag. Can you just elaborate a little bit on why free cash flow is off so much in Q4? Rahul Ghai : Yes. So a couple of different ways of looking at it, David. I mean clearly, we're driving more linear working capital performance through the year. And if you compare ourselves to last year Q4, where we had driven kind of half the cash flow for the full year in Q4, we got 20-plus days of working capital, call it 20 days of working capital improvement in Q4 last year. And this year, we're only getting less than 10 days. And that's driving a huge change between what we delivered in Q4 in cash last year, what we're delivering this year in Q4.  CapEx is a little bit up versus last year as well and step-up from Q3. So all in all -- and there is timing of tax payments, some accrued expenses. We've got some nonexecutive bonuses getting paid out in Q4 as well. So you put all that in, that's why Q4 is lower than Q4 last year in spite lower than Q3 '19 as well. But having said all that, I mean we are -- we've been delivering -- we delivered 10 days of working capital in Q2. We're delivering 12 days or better year-over-year performance in Q3. We're aiming for [indiscernible] in Q4. So there could be some upside to Q4 cash if we drive a little bit better performance in working capital. David Strauss : Okay. Bill, a question on how -- how are you thinking about -- I know you've been giving consideration around how you would report the combined company in terms of adjusted EPS number and what might be excluded. Could you give us an update there? And assuming the deal closed, let's say, in late June or early July, when would -- would you immediately come out and give guidance for the combined company? Or would this be something and wait until later? William Brown : David, I think if we close at the end of our fiscal year or thereabouts, Chris and I will work then in July as we close our books and report earnings early in August. My thinking at the moment, I think Chris is aligned with this, is that we would guide to the stub year, the 6-month back end of our calendar '19 and then maybe towards the end of the year or early in calendar '20, then guide to '20. And that's kind of what we're thinking at the moment. Again, we'll say more in the coming months. It all hinges on when we actually close the transaction.  We're still contemplating cash EPS likely to exclude amortization expense. But any more detail on that in terms of exactly how we're going to report that, I think, is still going to be determined. And Chris and I with the CFO of the company will certainly give some thought to that and share more about that as we get closer to close.

For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and our SEC filings.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the quarterly materials on the Investor Relations section of our website, where a replay of this call also will be available.  As supplemental information for investors, discussions also will include selected L3and Harris combined financial information, which combines the historical operating results as if the business had been operated together on the basis of a newly announced four segment structure during prior periods, but excluding the operating results of Harris\u2019 night vision business and L3\u2019s divested businesses. With that, Bill, I will turn it over to you. William Brown : So, thank you Anurag, good morning everybody. I\u2019m excited to welcome you to our first ever L3Harris Technologies earnings call. I\u2019m also pleased to welcome our new Chief Financial Officer, Jay Malave, who joined us on July 1 from United Technologies where he most recently was CFO of Carrier.  Prior to that Jay spent more than 20 years at the aerospace businesses, including as CFO of United Technologies Aerospace Systems and working the integration of the Goodrich acquisition. Many of you know Jay from his time leading the Investor Relations function at United Technologies and I\u2019m thrilled to have him onboard and confident he will be a strong business partner to me, Chris and the rest of the management team.  As you are aware on June 29, in fact in minutes after we ended Harris\u2019s fiscal \u201819, we successfully completed the transformative merger establishing L3Harris Technologies and we really hit the ground running.  On the first working day after closing, we consolidated headquarters activities between Harris and L3 and announced our new organizational model, creating four mission focused segments that combine the top talent of both companies.  In the first week we completed 115 Town Halls with senior leadership touching 80% of all employees, and then in the second week we held a multi-day leadership meeting were Chris and I shared our joint vision, values and operating philosophy with nearly 100 executives and then set out our initial game plan. I have to say that the level of energy and excitement across the company is extraordinary. So we are off to a good start as a combined company. We\u2019ll talk more about that in a few minutes. But let me first begin by providing an update on Harris\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal \u201819 results, followed by Chris with L3, Q2 and first half results and then Jay with combined L3 and Harris Financials and guidance.  So starting with Harris on slide three, we ended fiscal \u201819 on a high note with fourth quarter at non-GAAP earnings per share of 39% and revenue growth of 12%, the highest top line growth we\u2019ve seen in eight years.  Overall the company margin in the fourth quarter expanded 80 basis points to a record 20.2%. These results cap an exceptional year in which we accelerated revenue growth and had margin expansion in all three segments. We outperformed on all guidance metrics, and we delivered a record earnings per share of $8.29, up 30% and free cash flow of $1.055 billion. Total company book-to-bill was 1.1, driving funded backlog growth of 12%, and setting us up for continued toppling growth. All three segments contributed to our strong performance, driven by their top line growth which continued to exceed expectations. Let me take a few minutes to recap some of the highlights of the year on slide four and five, with the additional segment detail in the appendix. Communication Systems had a terrific year with revenue up 14% from solid growth in DoD Tactical and Public Safety. DoD Tactical ended the year with revenue of 31% from last year, and up 80% from fiscal \u201817. This strong growth was driven by nearly $300 million of modernization demand from the Army, Marine Corps and SOCOM as they embark on a multiyear upgrade cycle.  Modernization order momentum continued in the quarter with the Army awarding us a second HMS Manpack LRIP Order, followed in July with the release of the 2 Channel Leader Radio RFP. We also continued to execute well on our strategy to penetrate adjacent airborne markets and we were awarded the initial prototype phase of the Air Force\u2019s Airborne High Frequency Radio Modernization program, expanding our leadership is HF from ground airborne. International Tactical performed as expected and revenue was up 3% for the year, driven by the ramp on the Australian Modernization program, early adoption of multi-channel products in Canada and Western Europe and ongoing counterterrorism support in Africa.  Overall Tactical ended the year stronger than initially expected, with revenue up 14%, book-to-bill of 1.1 and backlog up 17% to $1.1 billion. This combined with the well supported DoD budget request, increasing international demand for 2 Channel Radios and executing on expansion into adjacency gives us confidence in the continued growth trajectory in Tactical for the second half of the year and the medium term.  In Electronic Systems, revenue increased 14%, the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth ending the year at 9%. The strong performance was driven by sustained growth in long term platforms F-35, F-18 and F-16 and more recently by growth on B-52 and SOCOM Rotary Aircraft, all of which collectively grew double digit as we leverage technology upgrades and ramp production. Orders were strong in ES ending the year at nearly $3 billion in booking, with two-thirds from the avionics and electronic warfare franchises as we continue to leverage our long standing customer relationships to solidify our position on new and long term platforms.  In April we received a $340 million award for F-35 Release Systems, supporting LRIP 12-14, which means all of our F-35 production content across avionics and release systems is now under multiyear contracts, which increases medium term visibility.  We also received a $72 million production order to deliver Upgraded Countermeasure Electronic Warfare Systems for the B-52 Platform, bringing that programs current value to over $430 million against the $1.3 billion total opportunity.  This order momentum, along with our investments in innovation, increased content on existing platforms and expansion of the next-gen platforms will drive a multiyear growth cycle in avionics and electronic warfare.  In Space and Intel, revenue was up 8% for the quarter and the year, well above our initial expectation of 4% to 5%, driven by mid-teens growth in our classified business. Order momentum was even stronger as we saw continued success in strengthening incumbent positions and expanding the addressable market of our classified business by providing end-to-end mission solutions and penetrating new adjacency.  I\u2019m also pleased with our relentless focus on operational excellence, which drove the margin expansion across each of our segments, despite the mixed challenges that come with new program starts.  Our operational excellence program called HPX has driven net productivity savings that more than offset the dilutive margin impact of DoD Tactical modernization and revenue growth on long-term platforms in classified space, resulting in total company margin of 20.2% for the fourth quarter and 19.8% for the year, 90 basis points of margin expansion.  Similarly, our multiyear focus on working capital has delivered terrific results. We ended the year with working capital of 41 days, a four day improvement over last year at a 37 day improvement since the XLS acquisition. Our working capital reduction, combined with earnings growth resulted in record free cash flow of $1.055 billion, exceeding the post XLS acquisition goal of $1 billion by 2019.  Overall, we had an outstanding year of accelerating revenue growth, margin expansion and record EPS and free cash flow, exceeding the targets we set for ourselves, and we\u2019ll continue building on this momentum as we go forward as L3Harris to drive continued above market growth, margin expansion and cash generation, creating long term value for our shareholders.  Let me now turn it over to Chris to discuss L3 results for the quarter and the first half. Chris? Chris Kubasik : Okay, thank you Bill and good morning everyone. Let me take a moment to thank and congratulate the L3 and Harris teams for their hard work this past quarter. Today\u2019s results from both companies are due to everyone\u2019s focus and the uncertain times leading up to the close of this historic merger.  As Bill mentioned, day one was seamless. We rolled out new email addresses to all L3 Harris employees, launched a new website and portal that connected to 50,000 employees across the globe and installed new signage at our 50 largest sites. On the operational side, in the first week we issued nearly 40 RFPs to our supplier base totaling $900 million in annual spend to start leveraging the purchasing power of the combined enterprise and to work towards our cost synergies goal.  Shifting now to L3 results, we had a solid second quarter, highlighted by our consolidated margin and free cash flow, both outperforming the second quarter guidance we discussed on our May earnings call. Margins expanded 160 basis points to 12.2% and free cash flow was up 38% to $220 million. Non-GAAP EPS was up 18% to $2.91 on 2% revenue growth. These results caped a strong first half with EPS up 21% on 8% revenue growth.  Total company margins expanded 130 basis points to 11.9% and free cash flow was $365 million or 5x last year\u2019s first half, as we executed on working capital improvements that resulted in a 12 day reduction over the past 12 months. Orders were up 8% resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.11 and funded backlog increased 16%. Turning to the segments on slide six, ISR revenue grew 2%, driven by a ramp up in WESCAM turret systems and the strength of our ISR missionization business, as several key programs accelerated, including the Australian Peregrine and the Presidential Aircraft recapitalization program.  This growth was partially offset by lower deliveries of night vision products due to export timing and operating income was up 50%, resulting in margin expansion of 460 basis points to 14.3%. This was due to higher volume, improved contract performance and L365 savings. In the first half ISR revenue was up 12% and operating income grew 45%, with margin expansion of 280 basis points to 12.3%.  In the Communication Segment revenue was flat in the quarter with higher production volume for UAV Communication System offset by lower volume in the Integrated Maritime and Microwave product sectors. Margins declined by 130 basis points to 7.9% from the dilutive mix impact of the Maritime Developmental Programs and the continued investment in Unmanned Undersea Vehicles. For the first half, segment revenue was up 5% with margin expansion of 20 basis points to 9.3%.  Lastly the Electronics Segment second quarter revenue was up 3% with strong growth in Precision Engagement Systems which includes the fuzing and ordnance business, F-35 Display Systems and Airport Security Equipment, more than offsetting the expected headwind in the Defense Training Solutions due to last year\u2019s competitive loss of the C-17 training contract and lower volume from Commercial Flight Simulator sales.  Margin expanded 10 basis points to 13.6% and in the first half segment revenue was up 3% with margin expansion of 10 basis points to 14.1%. Overall L3 had a strong first half, tracking above the guidance set at the beginning of the year and ahead of the amounts disclosed in the S4. Looking forward, as we announced on July 1 and detailed in the appendix to the webcast slides, we have organized L3 Harris into four segments, that group technologies and capabilities to allow us to compete across multiple missions and domains. Cutting across these segments, we have business development, operations and program excellent functions to drive further growth, while achieving greater costs and operational and programmatic efficiency.  We have worked on the structure since we announced the merger in October and have assembled an outstanding, seasoned and collaborative team to lead the new organization. I\u2019m excited to be part of it and look forward to the work ahead.  With that, I will turn it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s an honor to join the L3 Harris team and I look forward to working with the analyst investor community once again.  In a moment I will discuss L3 Harris guidance for the second half of calendar year 2019 and as a reminder, we have transitioned to calendar year reporting. But beforehand, in order to provide context and support for the guidance, I will walk through the L3 and Harris combined financials for the first half of calendar year 2019, which we prepared on the basis Anurag described at the start of the call and I\u2019ll also note various drivers in year-over-year comparisons in those results. Similarly all comparisons included in the guidance discussion are to the compatible prior year period L3 and Harris combined financials. Okay, starting with results. In the second quarter revenue was up 7% and EBIT increased 16% on higher volume and operational efficiencies, resulting in margin expansion of 140 basis points to 16.3%.  EPS grew by 27% to $4.65 and free cash flow was slightly above $1 billion, up more than 50% from last year. First half book-to-bill was 1.07.  Turning to our new segment structure on slide eight, integrated Mission Systems revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, up 3% driven by strong growth in Electro-Optical Airborne Imaging Systems and continued strength in the ISR Aircraft Missionization business, including the Australian Peregrine program. Operating income for the segment was up 14% to $150 million from higher volume and improved program performance. Operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 12.6%.  For the first half, segment revenue was up 12% and operating income increased 17% with margin expansion of 50 basis points to 12.1%. First half book-to-bill was 1.16.  Next in Space and Airborne Systems on slide nine, revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 17%, driven by double digit growth in avionics and electronic warfare, from a production ramp and new contact on long term aircraft platforms, as well as continued strength in classified space. Segment operating income increased 25% to $225 million and margin expanded 120 basis points to 18.8% from higher volume, stronger program performance and operational efficiencies. For the first half, segment revenue was up 16% and operating income increased 19% with margin of 18.2%. First half book-to-bill was 1.13.  Switching to Communication Systems on slide 10, revenue for the quarter was up 6% from strong growth in DoD Tactical and Public Safety, partially offset by lower deliveries of L3 night vision products due to timing and the transitional impact to full operational capability of the UAE Land Tactical System program.  Segment operating income was up 10%, and margin expanded 80 basis points to 21.6%. A strong program execution offset the mix impact from the ramp in Tactical Radio Modernization programs.  For the first half, segment revenue was up 12% and operating income increased 18% with margin expansion of 100 basis points to 21.5%. First half book-to-bill was 0.96 and that\u2019s coming off a book-to-bill of 1.27 in the last six months of 2018.  And lastly in Aviation Systems on slide 11, revenue for the quarter was up 2% as growth in precision engagement, airport security equipment and FAA programs was partially offset by the expected headwind in Defense Training Solutions due to last year\u2019s loss of the C-17 training contract and lower volume for Commercial Flight Simulators.  Segment operating income was up 11% and margin expanded 90 basis points from better cost management. For the first half segment revenue was up 1% and operating income increased 9% with margin expansion of 90 basis points to 10.5%. First half book-to-bill was 0.99.  Okay, now turning to guidance for the second half on slide 12. The strong year-to-date performance gives us confidence that we will continue to outperform markets in the back half of the year.  Starting with the top-line, we expect second half revenue to be up in the range of 9.5% to 10.5% with strong growth across all segments. This is supported by high visibility sales coverage from our backlog and high probability follow-on opportunities.  Second half total company EBIT margin is expected to be up approximately 170 basis points to 16.7% from higher volume, operational efficiencies and cost synergies. EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.95 to $5.05, which reflects higher profit and share repurchases which we will initiate over the next few days.  As announced on July 1, the Board has approved a 10% dividend increase and a $4 billion dollar share repurchase authorization program of which we will utilize $2.5 billion over the next 12 months.  In the second half we expect to generate free cash flow in a range of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion, reflecting higher earnings and one to two day reduction in working capital from June 2019. Capital expenditures are expected to be $190 million or 2% of revenue in the second half.  For the full year revenue is expected to be up in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%, with EBIT margin of approximately 16.2%, and EPS in the range of $9.60 to $9.70. Full year free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.35 billion.  Turning to the EPS bridges on slides 14 and 15, expected second half EPS at the midpoint of $5 reflects an increase of $0.94, driven by higher volume across the four segments, operational efficiencies and cost synergies, partially offset by the impact of a higher tax rate of about 18%. Expected full year EPS at the midpoint of $9.65 reflects a total increase of $1.65 with a $1.70 driven by operational improvement and cost synergies, an additional $0.17 coming from the elimination of L3 intangible and pension amortization and lower interest and share count, partially offset by a $0.22 tax headwind. Switching to the segment outlook : In Integrated Mission Systems we expect revenue to be up approximately 10.5% in the second half, driven by continued strength in Airborne Imaging Systems and growth in ISR Aircraft Missionization and Maritime Platforms with operating margin of approximately 12.5%.  Full year segment revenue is expected to be up approximately 11.2%, with operating margin of approximately 12.3%. Space and Airborne Systems revenue is expected to be up approximately 11.5% in the second half, driven by continued double digit growth in avionics and electronic warfare and strong growth in classified space. Segment operating margin is expected to be approximately 18.7%. Full year segment revenue is expected to grow approximately 13.9% with operating margin of approximately 18.4%. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be up approximately 9.5% in the second half, driven by strong growth across all sectors with operating margin in the range of 22.1%. Full year segment revenue is expected to be up approximately 10.7% with operating margin of approximately 21.8%.  Lastly, Aviation Systems revenue is expected to be up approximately 7% in the second half, driven largely by continued double digit growth in precision engagement. Operating margin is expected to be up \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, expected to be approximately 14% from improvements in EDD and productivity initiatives across the second.  Full year segment revenue is expected to grow approximately 4% with operating margin of about 12.3%. So to summarize, we expect the first half momentum to carry over to the second half in addition to the benefit from cost synergies, resulting in a strong 2019.  I\u2019ll stop here and turn it back over to Bill for closing remarks. William Brown : Well, thank you Jay and that\u2019s a lot to take in. So let me wrap up with a few comments on the budget and our strategic priorities going forward.  In regard to the budget, I\u2019m very encouraged by the recent bipartisan deal ranging the BCA caps over the next two years and removing the thread of sequestration. We continue to believe the House of Senate will support increased funding to meet the national security demands, which are well aligned with our core franchises. With budget outlays continuing to lag budget appropriations, we expect growth momentum to continue in the medium term.  A few weeks ago Chris and I aligned with our leadership team on our top strategic priorities, first and foremost being integration and accelerating the capture of cost synergies. We now expect to hit our gross run rate of $150 million by the end of calendar \u201919, putting us on track to meet or exceed 40% or $200 million of gross savings in calendar 2020.  We are off to a great start on segment and head quarter consolidations and supply chain activities, and we are growing increasingly confident exceeding $500 million gross cost synergies in calendar \u201822. Other priorities include, driving operational excellence to our new program called E3 : Excellence Everywhere Everyday, establishing a new performance culture, building on the strengths of both companies, investing smartly and aggressively in technology to grow revenue and increase share, reshaping our portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth, technology differentiated businesses and maximizing cash flow that will be returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.  Overall the progress and alignment in the first 30 days has exceeded our expectations, and we feel even more confident in the strategic combination, and our ability to deliver shareholder value.  So with that, let me turn to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners. Caller, you may proceed. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Bill Brown : Hey, good morning Robert. Robert Stallard : Maybe a quick first question for Bill. There was some commentary, the Paris Air Show, the combined company might be looking at some post-merger disposals and I wonder if there had been any further thought or development on that front? William Brown : Well Rob, thanks for the question. Yeah, it\u2019s definitely a key priority as I mentioned in my closing remarks in terms of top priorities for the management team. Certainly as we\u2019ve talked about before on this call and other venues, a broader mix of businesses gives us an opportunity to take a fresh look at the combined company portfolio and really think about what fits, what doesn\u2019t fit, certainly gives us an optionality to do something\u2019s with businesses that we no longer consider strategic.  We continue to look at this through a couple of different lenses. Certainly one is, does the business have technology that\u2019s required by differentiation? Can we deliver good returns? Can we grow and win, gain share etcetera, and we are going to evaluate what businesses were based on those metrics.  We continue to have this dialogue, Chris and I are working very hard on this, we are engaging our new board on this as well. We are not going to deliberate decisions and discussions in public, but it\u2019s really top of mind to us Rob. Robert Stallard : Okay thanks, and then maybe as a follow-on Jay and welcome back. In the free cash flow guidance, that\u2019s around $400 million worth of adjustments and I was wondering how many of these one off items for 2019 and won\u2019t be repeating themselves in 2020 and beyond? Thanks. Jay Malave : Are you talking about the back half, Rob. Robert Stallard : Yeah, it\u2019s in the release. There\u2019s a reconciliation of the guidance for the full year. We\u2019ve got 1875 to 1925 and then the number of adjustments gets you to 2.3 to 2.35 adjusted free cash flow for the year. Jay Malave : Right, so when you look at that, we will continue to expect some of the integration costs, we\u2019ll still see it going into next year from a cash basis. But let me just take you back to the second half of free cash flow, because we expect you know an up-tick in net income. There will be a little bit of an outflow related to our working capital within one or two days improvement, but we\u2019re going to try to hold that flat and we\u2019ll see a little bit of a benefit in cash taxes.  So we feel good about the second half, specific to your question in terms of what we see going next year. As I mentioned there will be some continued costs related to the integration, restructuring type level of costs and those type of items, but beyond that I don\u2019t expect there to be other significant items that will repeat going forward. Bill Brown : I mean just in a nutshell, I think for the year Rob, $260 million of free cash impact from deal and integration cost. We had about $25 million or so in the first half. The $235 million will be in the back half. About $100 million of that 95 are going to be deal cots; that\u2019s going to be behind us by Q3. You know the balance is integration costs and we\u2019ll see some little drag forward into calendar \u201820 on integration costs as well. Robert Stallard : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Caller you may proceed. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks. Good morning Bill and Chris and welcome Jay. On the deal closing you guys increased share repurchases in your dividends, how are you may be thinking about your overall free cash flow target and targeting return to shareholders? Bill Brown : Well, I think you know as Jay was alluding to, we feel good about this year in terms of cash generation. We are still targeting $3 billion three years out, that\u2019s calendar \u201922, we\u2019ll certainly ramp to that. So I think we\u2019re off to a really good start in terms of the cash we generated in the first half. You know LTM cash, what we are going to do this year. So you know, all that\u2019s looking pretty good. We ended June on a proforma basis with $1.7 billion of balance sheet. You know we are going to generate about say $2.5 billion more or less in the next 12 months. So that\u2019s puts us about $4.2 billion more or less of cash available for deployment. You know our dividend is about $700 million, $680 million and that\u2019s including the 10% increase we did, that we announced on July 1 that will be enacted here in August, we\u2019ll reevaluate that in January, about $700 million in dividends.  We have about $300 million worth of deal and integration costs, we just spoke about that over the next 12 months. We had to fund the surf [ph] and differed compensation programs, but what that means, that leave you about $3 billion over that period of time. For things that do, $2.5 billion is on buyback and about $0.5 billion Sheila, that\u2019s going to be held on the balance sheet, just because that\u2019s what we require for normal working capital needs. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Sure. Thanks and then maybe just on the margins, the pro forma margin guidance for the total company implies second half margins are up 80 basis points over the first half. But just a decent acceleration, can you maybe talk about the moving pieces, how much of that is coming from synergies versus the underlying business profitability? Bill Brown : Yeah, so you\u2019re right Sheila, the first half on a pro forma basis up 90 basis points, the second half up 170, so it\u2019s up subsequently as well, 16.7. For the year about 130 basis points of margin expansion, so 16 too, a little bit better than we had though when we put the deal together in the S4, so we feel good about the trajectory.  You know as we mentioned on the call about $40 million on the back half is coming from net cost synergies. There\u2019s a road map in the back on the EPS bridge which indicates the absence of L3 intangibles and pension amortization for another $40 million $43 million.  We see an operational improvement year-over-year in a couple of businesses from L3 including EDD. We see operational excellence savings which offset some mix, grow some investments in the back half, all of which gets us to about that 170 in the back half and we feel it\u2019s pretty well calibrated. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks. Very precise as always. Operator : Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Caller, you may proceed. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Bill Brown : Good morning. Carter Copeland : Just a couple quick ones. One, I realize it\u2019s hard because we didn\u2019t have a, you know a Harris guide for the next, you know sort of fiscal year out there. But it looks like on a pro forma basis the top line that you\u2019ve you know put forth for the second half is a little bit ahead of where we may have been on a pro forma basis coming in. Can you just verify that and maybe help us size it. And then as a follow on, you know I wondered as part of the many decisions you made in getting the deal closed and what not, where you shook out on things like incentive compensation, not necessarily for the executive team, but as you go a layer down in terms of you know driving this sort of behavior that you want and so was anything useful or notable to speak about there that that will help us understand, you know where your points of emphasis are? Thanks guys. Bill Brown : Yeah, sure Carter, thanks. So really on the first point, first of all Harris is feeling a little bit backtracking, a bit better on our calendar \u201819 in terms of versus the S4 and a combined company basis. For calendar \u201819 we are about a $0.5 billion better. So you know it\u2019s quite a bit stronger than we envisioned late last year when we put out the S4, but again as we mentioned at that time, the S4 was related to strategic plans which were put together earlier in the year over the summer. You know when the markets guide a bit better, we want some strategic opportunities, so we feel good about where we are at in calendar \u201919, a bit better than we started. You know \u201820 is looking pretty good as well as certainly with the budget, a backdrop, you know a strong funded backlog at the beginning \u2013 at the midpoint of the year, up 15%. So a lot of this tracking I think for really good top line progress.  On the comp program, you know we are still in discussions with our Board in terms of what we do going forward, but you know Chris and I, you know obviously there\u2019s a short term plan and a longer term plan. On the short term basis it will be some combination of revenue op-income and free cash, and since we all know the importance of cash generation, the impotence of driving working capital improvements, you know there\u2019s probably a slight tilt towards free cash, much like we did a number of years ago at Harris. You\u2019ll note Chris mention about the big step up in the first half and free cash generation, a 5x over the first half of last year. I think 50% of the short term comp for the L3 executives came on free cash, and we all know when you incentivize for something you get results. So that\u2019s kind of what we are thinking on a short term basis. Longer term it will be performance based equity, you know that will be tied to the targets we are discussing with share owners. Carter Copeland : Okay, great. Thanks. Bill Brown : You bet Carter. Carter Copeland : Our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Caller, you may proceed. Peter Arment : Yeah thanks. Good morning Bill, Chris, Jay. A question Jay, I guess on CapEx you mention $190 million for the second half of the year, about 2% of revenues. Just thinking about longer term as we think over the forecast period and thinking about your integration period, is that still a good number to go off of about 2% of sales? Chris Kubasik : Yeah I believe it is Peter, I mean 2% this year on a full year basis, that\u2019s $380 million, $190 million in the first half, $190 million in the second half. I think going forward it feels like that\u2019s the right place to be to fund and be prepare for the growth, and yeah, I think 2% is where we should go with. Peter Arment : Okay, and just as a quick follow up. I know you are not talking about quarterly guidance here, but just thinking about the second half guidance that you put out. Is there anything you\u2019d call out regarding 3Q versus 4Q either on the EPS or free cash flow, just thinking from a modeling perspective for the street? Thanks. Bill Brown : Nothing material Peter. There\u2019ll be additional non-GAAP charges in Q3, because of some of the deal and integration expenses, but on a non-GAAP reported earnings per share, revenue growth should all look pretty stable, Q3 versus Q4. Peter Arment : Thank you for the color. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Caller, you may proceed. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for all the information and welcome Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, David. David Strauss : Bill, you used to have \u2013 in the Harris deck you had a slide that showed the medium term outlook by segment. I want to see if you might offer, since we are new to the combined company segment, so I wanted to see if you would offer your thoughts on kind of how the growth rates relative to each other among the segments might look going forward and also from a margin opportunity, beyond what we\u2019re looking at for the second half of \u201919. Jay Malave : Well David, I mean it\u2019s still a bit early. I mean obviously we just put the company together and it took enormous work to put together pro forma guidance in the back half. So it\u2019s a little bit premature to get out beyond that, but maybe just some high level comments without getting into the segment by segment looks here.  You know for us, I mean looking at 10% growth in a calendar year, in the industry that happened to be in, it\u2019s pretty special. You follow us, you follow others in the space. You know looking at 10% in the back half feels pretty good as well. So you know I mentioned the S4 is a little dated. We are doing a lot better than the S4, about $0.5 billion stronger this year. So we\u2019re coming off a stronger starting point. You know in the S4 I think L3 numbers were growing at 5% to 6% in that range. We are a bit, a little bit higher than that. You know I see us continuing to grow in that mid to high single digit range into \u201820 and maybe a little bit beyond that.  It comes from you know a good bipartisan budget deal. You know the topline budget is not growing that much, 3% and then basically flat the year after, but the certainty that provides, the funding lines that we see tactical, F-35, other plays that affect the business look very, very good and very positive. It features a $122 billion worth of appropriations that are out there, that are exceeding the outlays. So those outlays have to catch up. This is a lot of dry-powder in the system that should keep, well you know all of the boats moving in the water and we feel pretty good about the medium term outlook.  On the margins side, look ending at 16.2 this year will be a great result. You know we\u2019re at the front end of our ramp on synergies. Only $40 million this year getting to $300 million several years out, that\u2019s another 170, 180 basis points. So if you could kind of run the math and get to 18% pretty quickly a few years out, and we\u2019ll ramp to that as quickly as we can. So you know as we look out in the back end of the year we feel great and I think the outlook into calendar \u201820 also looks pretty good too. David Strauss : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. As a follow-up I wanted to ask about the free cash flow cadence beyond this year. So you know you are guiding to the full year adjusted free cash flow number around $2 billion, $3 billion. You\u2019ve got this $3 billion target for 2022, I guess counter 2022. You know and applies like a little less than 10% CAGR between here and there, which just seems a little light given what you are talking about from a working capital upside opportunity and synergies. Can you just help square that, why it\u2019s not a higher growth rate between here and there? Bill Brown : You know look, we feel really good about where we ended on an LTM basis on cash and just for you know referencing a couple of data points. I mean Harris over the last 12 months was better than, by four days of working capital. So we went from 45 to 41, a day or two better than we thought a couple months ago.  L3s results were 12 days better, year-over-year in the June ending quarter. You know so we are making good progress. Over the balance of the year we are only looking at another day or two between June and the back end of the year. You know but we are starting from our 75 days pro forma at the end of June. You know Harris is sitting at 41.  You know I think we got a lot of opportunity ahead of us, let\u2019s get through the next couple of quarters, we\u2019ll give you guidance on calendar \u201920, and certainly as I look at Chris and Jay, you know we\u2019re all over trying to figure out a way to make sure the cash gets accelerated, that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re trying to do. Chris Kubasik : David, keep in mind, the working capital is going to want to grow with the increase in volume. So our challenge is going to be to take out the productivity in working capital and hold it flat over that period of time. Chris Kubasik : You know I\u2019ll just chime in, that we are clearly focused on this David. You\u2019ve seen the progress as Bill mentioned, the 12 days. The good news is a lot of that is coming out of inventory, a little bit out of day sales outstanding. So we haven\u2019t even really focused on the payable levels. So the teams are working as hard and we\u2019re allocating targets right down to the program manager level. Everybody knows what they need to do to achieve these targets. David Strauss : Great! Thanks everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen. Caller, you may proceed. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thank you. I may have missed it, but Bill could you talk about maybe some sort of ballpark of what you expect in divestments now that the deal is closed in terms of size? Maybe by sales, and then I have a follow-up. Bill Brown : No, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re to sort of size it because the decisions aren\u2019t yet made you know, and we are at the front end of the process. It\u2019s going to take some time to get alignment, you know work the process and what I\u2019ll do Gautam as I\u2019ve done before, I know Chris has done before is, you know rather than talking about something that we are going to do, I\u2019ll talk about what we have done when that is done. So we don\u2019t have a predetermined target for what we\u2019re trying to do. Again what we are looking at is, is we want to make sure the management team is focused on the business that are strategic, ones that are technology driven, have great returns we can win and Chris and I spent a lot of time in the last few months on this. We working with our boards; we\u2019ve got a meeting coming up in a couple of weeks on this. So we are on it, but I\u2019m not going to size how much the divestiture might be until we really get around to making some decisions around that. Gautam Khanna : I appreciate that. Just a quick follow up, tactical comp, book-to-bill look pretty strong. I was wondering if you could give us some flavor on you know the 12 to 18 months outlook, the pipeline, international domestic and just any commentary you can give around. Chris Kubasik : Yeah, but look, I mean the international pipeline remains pretty good at about $2.5 billion and the shape of its not changed a lot. So we had a good finish on international, basically flattish on Q4, but we had a good year about 3%. You know DoD pipeline is around $1.7 billion, so it\u2019s up a little bit. What\u2019s interesting is the mix. It\u2019s about 50/50 now between base and modernization, as we would have expected, modernization is starting to grow and we\u2019re seeing that over the course of fiscal \u201919. It basically tripled in size in terms of modernization. The pipeline is now half modernization, that\u2019s back stopped by what is a pretty good budget outlook.  So I got to tell you Gautam, we had a good year intact, where the guys did such a great job. You know we were up about 13% this year in calendar \u201919. You know it\u2019s going to be you know about 10%, 12% or so, low double digit in the back half. DoD is going to continue to grow pretty well.  When we see international, the low to mid-single digit range, so we see continued momentum in this business you know and it goes beyond the back end of the year based on what I\u2019m seeing in the budget. So you know the tactical business is performing very well as expected. Gautam Khanna : And last one from me, Bill any major recompletion monitoring over the next 12 months. Thank you. Bill Brown : In major recompetes, what was the question? Okay, I think if it was a major recompetes, we are going to see a lot over the last 12 months. I mean there\u2019s always places that we are bidding, and there\u2019s opportunities out there, you know but there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really significant. The one that really comes to the mind is what we call our sensor program. That\u2019s where we do maintenance for ground based telescopes, out of all sites around the work, the legacy Exelis program to $150 million to $200 million a year of revenue, it\u2019s under a recompete.  But it\u2019s one of those programs I feel very strongly about. From way back when we bought Exelis it was about 35%, 38% on time delivery. We closed the quarter around 94%, 95% very, very good reputation with the customer. So that\u2019s the only one that\u2019s jumping off my mind as a recompete and certainly I got my eye on it, but nothing more than that Gautam. So thanks for the question. Gautam Khanna : Thanks you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of SunTrust. Caller you may proceed. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions and a nice result. Just on the second half margins, specifically the aviation segment, I think you\u2019ve got you know pretty strong margin expansion in the second half of the year. They are looking at 14% versus you know 10.5%. You gave some initial comments on what\u2019s driving that, but can you be a little bit more specific there on the sharp margin expansion in that segment? Chris Kubasik : Yeah, this is Chris. We see an up ramp from a couple of main drivers. If you recall we have the EDD business in there, which of course is a tough compare for \u201818 compared to \u201919. So we talked earlier in January about a significant improvement, 40 basis points from not having the same issues of EDD which we don\u2019t expect to have in \u201819 that we had an \u201918.  We have some E3 savings that are pretty significant in the $40 million range and we have a pretty good road path to execute upon those and you know we have some growth opportunities in the commercial aviation sector, specifically avionics that has higher margins in addition to some, using an ordinance opportunities. All that contributes to the guidance we gave. Michael Ciarmoli : Got it, and then just a bigger picture on the defense budget. I know we\u2019ve got the two year budget deal, but any thoughts on sort of what\u2019s taking place now with the expansion of this night core process that you know mark us for looks to be implementing. Do you guys see this as a risk or opportunity as you look at the potential pipeline of business, you know versus modernization, legacy, I know you know funding lines look good now, but it seems like you know what we saw take place at the Army could be expanding now into the Navy and Air Force and just wondering how you guys are viewing that process? Bill Brown : Well look, I think it\u2019s still very early. It was only confirmed very recently, but through what he did when he was Army Secretary was actually a very positive, very productive. I think it\u2019s notable that he with Ryan McCarthy, with the Chief got together and really prioritize where they want to spend limited army dollars and focus on key priorities, and start to move away from things that weren\u2019t you know all that critical.  The fact is I think between what we do, what L3 does on a combined basis. You know the fact is working on important programs and I think we ended up doing very well through the army process. I\u2019d envision the same thing for across DoD what is now going to work on. So you know the discipline of looking at where they want to spend dollars is important and I think based on the things that were working on, you know we are going to be, I would think we are going to end up being pretty strong here. Michael Ciarmoli : Sounds good. Thanks guys. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Caller, you may proceed. George Shapiro : Hi, good morning. I was wondering, Bill if you could provide a breakdown of your revenues between the O&M budget and the investment budget, because L3 had a high percentage from the O&M budget? Bill Brown : Yeah, no, on the DoD side, so we are about 55%, 60% DoD and it\u2019s not 50/50 O&M versus procurement. George Shapiro : Okay and then with some of the shorter cycle businesses that you are in and the flattening of the budget, is there any concern that your growth rate can slow somewhat quickly or more quickly than others with longer cycle businesses might have or you think that you gained enough share that we keep going on with better than industry growth rates. Bill Brown : Yeah I mean the short cycle business that we really have talked about in the past George is really around the tactical radio business and that has become, you know when we merge with Exelis, it became a smaller piece of the overall company. Certainly as we improved in the other segment you know so it was like 35%, 36% of the legacy Harris companies, not even the smaller part of L3 Harris.  You know but the fact is, it is a relatively quick turn business, but it\u2019s a little bit different today than it would have been a few years ago. But today lot more of the business is driven by modernization, and modernization, there\u2019s a lot more visibility into it than these quick turn O&M funded orders that we would have gotten in the past. So I\u2019m not terribly concerned, we had a very, very strong calendar of fiscal \u201919. We had a really extraordinary first half of calendar \u201919 in DoD Tactical. Well, that would naturally mitigate itself from or slow down a little bit in the back half, but it\u2019s still very healthy growth, north of 20%. So look, it\u2019s a great business, we\u2019re across all of the different platforms, different contract vehicles, all the services on the front end of what we believe is a multiyear ramp here George. George Shapiro : Okay, very good. Thanks very much. A - Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Caller, you may proceed. Rob Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning Rob. Rob Spingarn : Congrats on the deal. I just wanted to go back to the guidance and this really could be for anybody, but Jay this is the guidance you gave. If I look at the second half revenues, it looks like in everything but AS, we have a slight decrease in growth. Is that just comps or is there anything else going on there? Jay Malave : Yeah Rob, some of it is comps. We had you know up in the last half of last year some pretty significant growth rates, but you\u2019re talking, you\u2019re kind of splitting hairs. In the Integration Mission System business it was 12% growth in the first half, we were expecting around 10.5%, so a real slight reduction there. In Communication Systems we are nearly 12%, we\u2019re going to be 9.5% there, close to 10%.  And so yeah, I\u2019d say more compares than anything else, but the growth rates are still pretty substantial and pretty significant to support the 10% in the back half. As I said in my comments, high visibility with the backlog. We have 90% visibility in the backlog to the back half and so we feel really good about going into this next six months. Rob Spingarn : And then I guess for the increase in growth in AS, does this go back to the comments that Chris just made about some new programs or are there things ramping there? Bill Brown : We are seeing, you know what Chris called the Precision Engagement Systems business. It ramps a bit more in the back half than the front half. It grew really nicely in the first half. You know even stronger in the back and it\u2019s just a lot of classified work that Chris and his team have solidify themselves on, plus a lot of fusing business for munitions and that [inaudible] there is pretty high. We\u2019re also getting you know a little bit better comps on the commercial training business, the defense training business looks a little bit better, the C-17 carries for the full year, but there\u2019s F-16 wins that have happened that\u2019s going to help mitigate the C-17 loss in the back half. So really across all the pieces of AS it just get better and that\u2019s where we are seeing you know better growth in the back half than the front half. Rob Spingarn : Okay, and then just a clarification, just on the proceeds from the night vision sale, just the L3 pension pre-funding that I think you were going to direct those proceeds toward, has that happened? Is that in the op-cash flow guidance for this year? Bill Brown : You know what\u2019s going to happen is so we\u2019re still on track with that. The net proceeds will be about $325 million. We expect to get through the process in Q3, its deep in the sypheus [ph] review and that will be used to prefund the pension. You know that would basically mitigate any cash contributions on the all three sides of the pension through the next couple years into calendar \u201922. So that\u2019s like a $70 million, $80 million improvement if you will in cash, but you know remember night vision generated some cash, so there\u2019s a bit of an offset. On an annualized basis that sort of a $50 million, $60 million net benefit to us on the free cash side and that is in our guidance. Rob Spingarn : The timing is in the guidance for this year. Bill Brown : Its not in the back half. It\u2019s in the outlook as we are getting into \u201920 and beyond. Rob Spingarn : Okay, thank you that. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research Group. Caller, you may proceed. Richard Safran : Thanks. Bill, Chris, Jay good morning, how are you? Bill Brown : Good Rich, good morning. Richard Safran : First I had a bit of a top level kind of philosophy question here. You know for lack of a better term, you know commercial business model has really been at the core of Harris. So what I wanted to ask was how long you might think it might take to apply that model to the new combined company? How long do you think it might be before we see tangible results? Just interested in any color you could provide there on how you are thinking about implementing that? Bill Brown : Well, it\u2019s a great question and its less philosophical, more a financial in a sense of what we\u2019ve tried to do. You know relate back to where we were three years ago with Exelis. Exelis manufactured radios and for Wayne it was under a sort of normal model and with cost disclosures and we moved that up to Rochester. It took us some time, but that\u2019s now our full commercial model business.  And L3 WESCAM, the WESCAM business had a very profitable, nice size business, growing very well, great positions around the world, that\u2019s a commercial model business, much like what we do in the tactical side. There\u2019s a possibility to take the SATCOM business that L3 has was very strong and over time migrate that to a commercial model. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll work on. It may not be a needle mover in the next couple of years. It\u2019s something that obviously we are focused on, but I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s going to be the key driver to margin expansion. It\u2019s going to come through operational excellence, it\u2019s going to come through synergy, it\u2019s going to come though basic better performance in our company. So I mean we are certainly on it, Richard. Richard Safran : Okay, thanks for that. Now, just quickly on the F-35 program, you know just following up on your opening remarks, you know just generally we\u2019ve see a lot of changes among suppliers on the F- 35 program. So I just wanted to know, you know are there still incremental opportunities out there for you on that program and if possible in your answer, could you just discuss how your content on that platform is evolved? Bill Brown : Yeah, sure. We you know \u2013 now I\u2019m going to quote the number. This is probably just legacy of Harris. I\u2019m looking to Anurag and Jay to confirm this. So there\u2019s like $2.2 million per ship set today. So we do the common components, we do the maddle [ph] system, we do the release systems, so about $2.2 million. That we know is going to grow to about $2.7 million over the next several years. You know we won three different pieces of what they call Tech New Fresh , so one is the mission computer called the ICP. You know there is the aircraft memory system, as well as the electronic unit, the Panorama cockpit display, PCD EU and all those things add together over time to give us another $0.5 billion of content for F-35. So that\u2019s going to grow in terms of content per ship set and then it\u2019s going to also grow with the ramp, which is why it\u2019s an important one for us to keep talking about. As the number of the ship set continue to growth, plus our content continues to grow, it\u2019s going to continue to be a growth driver for the company. Chris Kubasik : And Richard on the Legacy L3, as you know we have the crypto, we have the display, so you know think of another 500 or 600 per ship set as well and when we put the merger together, we talked about the benefits of scale. I think Lockheed Martin would knowledge we were one of the top suppliers. It gives you better access to the management team to be a part of the strategy and we would expect a bid on other components in the years ahead, given our scale and investments. Richard Safran : Thanks very much; appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Caller, you may proceed. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning everybody. Bill Brown : Morning. Noah Poponak : In the three, the $3 billion, three year free cash flow target, what is the you know underlying organic business segment. So you know putting aside anything below the line, putting aside the working capital opportunity in the synergies, just the core newly combined business segment EBITDA growth rate on that three year basis that you are assuming in the $3 billion. Bill Brown : Yeah, I think topline is around 5%, 6%, a little bit higher than that on a EBITDA growth. When we \u2013 it yields about $0.5 billion of incremental net income, incremental cash coming from growth over the three year period. Noah Poponak : Okay. I guess 500 on the new \u2013 should I be thinking about that relative to the 23 to 23.5, so I would kind of 20% of that, but over three years, so call it a 6% CAGR. Bill Brown : Yet it was off like a $2.0 billion to $2.1 billion free cash basis. So it\u2019s going to be maybe a little bit less than that, but yeah it\u2019s in about that range, 6%, 7%. Noah Poponak : Okay. And then just to make sure I have the bridge correct, working off of this year, in the 23 to 23.5 how much working capital and synergy is in there? It sounded like the one to two days of working capitals maybe $50 million and then I thought I saw $40 million of synergy in the deck, but then I, Bill I heard you saying 150. I didn\u2019t know if maybe that was a run rate number. Can you just clarify those for me? Bill Brown : Yeah sure, so there\u2019s $40 million of net synergies in the back half, net synergies in the full year as well and that drop through into generating cash on an after tax basis. The 150 is the run rate will be added in terms of costs synergies by the calendar year. So that\u2019s the run rate we\u2019ll be at \u2013 which gives us confidence that we can be at $200 million, so in calendar \u201820 gross savings dropping through, so that\u2019s how we talked about it.  Over the course of the back end of the year, I think we\u2019re around 75 days on a pro forma basis in June. As Jay pointed out, we\u2019re expecting one to two days of improvement, sequentially through the back end of the working capital, so anything around 74, 73 days. Noah Poponak : Okay, so I should be kind of in the zone of maybe call it $100 million of the $500 million that you had for the \u2013 in that free cash flow bridge of net after tax energy plus capital efficiency, maybe $100 million of the $500 million is happening in 2019. Bill Brown : I\u2019m not sure. I mean we\u2019re looking at each other here, not sure\u2026 Noah Poponak : Well, if its $40 million to $50 million of synergy and then one of two days of working capital, I guess, that would be. Bill Brown : The one \u2013 two ways of working capital on a full year basis is probably on the order of $30 million, $60 million in that range. So will be half that over the course of the back end of the year. Noah Poponak : Okay. And then just you know a bigger picture on the margins, you know clearly the margins will expand if you achieve the synergy plans, but should we be giving consideration for margin expansion in the underlying business before synergies. You know Harris kind of had incremental margins from the partially commercial model. Legacy L3 had plans to continue to improve the operations in the margins of the business before the deal. Is it fair to assume the margins are expanding independent of the synergies, and then synergies in addition to that?  It\u2019s fair to assume that. Yeah, both independent businesses had talked about margin expansion. You know in both pieces it was on the order of 100 basis points and certainly the synergies that we had talked about that would be incremental to that, which is you know going back you know when we first talked about the deal on a pro forma basis, the EBIT margin was around 14. We said that we\u2019d get around 17 through 100 basis point organic growth of margins, another 200 basis points on synergy to get to 17. Obviously while you\u2019re coming here into calendar 16, we are doing a bit better than that as starting off here. So yeah, it is incremental to the benefits of synergies Noah. Noah Poponak : Great. Thanks very much. Bill Brown : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Caller, you may proceed. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Apologize if I missed it in the prepared remarks, I know there was a lot going on, but the profitability in the communications business at L3 in the quarter, you know just nearly 8%. Maybe if you can address that, and it kind of seemed like we were moving path last year as she is and kind of \u2013 what kind of risks that presents going forward? Chris Kubasik : Yeah Seth, this is Chris. That was driven as we put in the prepared comments, mainly by the Maritime sector. We have a pretty strong international focus in Maritime, we have some steady cornerstone programs as they cover them on, there\u2019s a column focused on sensors and control systems, but there are some new developments going on.  One, in the on Mandarin both service and undersea and that requires investments and I think we have some new programs for the Columbia and the destroyer and laser weapons. Those were slowed in the quarter by some additional costs to get those development programs on track, and those will have long 10 to 20 year lag once we get going. So it was focused on Maritime development to answer your question. Seth Seifman : Great, thanks. And then Bill in Legacy Harris, the Space and Intelligence Segment, it seems like the book-to-bill for fiscal \u201819 was probably around 1.0, which is pretty solid and obviously there\u2019s some good growth there, but there\u2019s also you know a ton of growth in the Space budget. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about the visibility you have there, and you know the confidence you have that you guys are taking your fair share on the Space side? Bill Brown : Yeah look, Seth we feel very good about the space business. You\u2019re right, I mean in the year the book-to-bill is over one, you know backlog came up a little bit, so there\u2019s a good trend there and we\u2019ve talked about that pretty consistently over the course of a fiscal \u201819 with the classified business being up in the teens or is looking pretty good.  That comes in a couple different areas. When we talk about classified businesses, it\u2019s not just Space. So there\u2019s opportunities in Space, it\u2019s both exquisite as well as moving to SmallSat and the team has just done a great job, you know maintaining a strong position on exquisite components, while at the same time taking the lead on full end admission solutions with SmallSat. But our classified business in that area also relates to other domains and that\u2019s business continues to go well. Again, the same philosophy moving from providing components to subsystem to now full mission solutions, whether they be terrestrial systems, near shore system, deep water systems, you know and that business has gone very well and it\u2019s really this philosophy. There\u2019s the budgets are coming up, and we are expanding in our ability to compete on more full end admission solutions, and you can see the trajectory happening in the back end of the year. We continue to see strong growth in the classified business. Chris Kubasik : I\u2019ll just day that Bill and I spent a fair amount of time last week reviewing the classified business and I was thoroughly impressed with the technology and the opportunities. So we\u2019re excited about the Space business going forward and other classified as well. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Caller, you may proceed. Jon Raviv : Hey, good morning, and thank you. Now that we had some more time pass, any sort of additional perspective on industry M&A would be appreciated by you guys as others talk of you know more skilled investments to increase their probability of wins, and by definition taking some market share. What do you consider the impact to be on LHX going forward besides bagging you a nice CFO? Bill Brown : [Cross Talk] Exactly. So let me start into them as you led the fact. Chris Kubasik : Well look, I think we \u2013 so Chris and I started this conversation quite a long time ago, you know with a goal of creating a very large scale mission solutions prime and that's exactly what we've done. We continue to assess implication of what other people in the space do, but from what I look at, we\u2019re just a company that we have created and the opportunities ahead of us; I think we're very well positioned.  When you talk about scale, I think we are scaling places where we need to be scaled. We were scaled in tactical radios and becoming scale in the space business, so scale in lots of different areas of the company you know and we feel great.  The company is a technology leader. You know our strategy is to continue to invest significantly and aggressively in innovation. You know we've been running about 4% of our revenue in Iraq and we continue to see that continue to go up. You know we've got great set of people who are great technologists and business leaders to drive our business.  You know what's going to require for us to win is continuing to accelerate the deployment of technologies into the market place, into the field as a war fighter and then continue to execute well on our programs. You know that's what we can do, and no matter what happens in the market and the changes in the structure, we're going to keep focused on what we do well, the things that we can control and it's a technology in a way we execute, so I think we're in a good spot here John. Jon Raviv : Great, thanks. I\u2019ll keep it to one since I know we\u2019re up for time here. Bill Brown : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Joshua Sullivan of Seaport Global Securities. Caller, you may proceed. Joshua Sullivan : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the time for the last question here. You are just given the success with the Exelis combination and maybe using that as a benchmark, can you talk about how the experience so far with L3 has then maybe similar to that integration and then maybe where it's been a little more dynamic? Bill Brown : Well, certainly it\u2019s a much bigger scale you know clearly and there's a lot of complexity within L3 was a company built over 20 years through a lot of M&A and Chris has talked about the desire to move from a holding company to an operating company and we server one that journey. So getting information, getting it you know consistently across businesses is a bit of a challenge, but the reality is we\u2019ve out of the gauge very, very, quickly; we've got a great seasoned integration team; people that are very experienced, they've done this before.  There are a lot of people from the Exelis integration. We're getting data very quickly; you know the enthusiasm and energy across the company is very good. You know it's gone from my vantage point certainly better than we would have imagined and better than we did with Exelis. You know we're going faster on supply chain. That was an area that took a little time to ramp up too on Exelis, so we\u2019re acting a lot faster this time. Obviously with the segments and the headquarters we made those decisions, we execute on that on day one here which is very important.  You know the revenue opportunities ahead of us are quite significant, something that Chris is spending a lot of time on and we\u2019re very encouraged. So we're going to get on that probably a lot faster this time than we do with excels. Keep in mind we're in a different market space, we\u2019re different sort of part in the cycle.  Back with Exelis, we're still coming out of sequestration. The visibility and the budgets weren\u2019t very strong, you know so we focused much more on cost side. This time it\u2019s different, you know and Chris and the team are really putting a lot of time and effort into making sure we understand what the revenue opportunities are and then making sure that we fund them. So you know I'm optimistic about the trajectory that we\u2019re on here and clearly we want a great path to deliver $0.5 billion of gross cost synergies and hopefully a bit that more than that over time Josh. Joshua Sullivan : I appreciate that. I\u2019ll keep it to one as well, thank you. A - Bill Brown : So that wraps up our call. So thank you very, very much. Chris and I are very excited about the company that we\u2019ve created and getting to the closure of this historic merger on exactly the minute that we thought we would be in mid-October of last year. There's a lot of precision in that as you'd expect from us in this team.  We're very excited, we're confident, created a lot of value for owners, but importantly Chris mentioned this in his comments; we have 50,000 employees of this company who are working very, very hard to deliver results, keep their focus on the customer and we want to thank them for all their efforts and we look forward to updating you again on the merger and the progress we\u2019re having at the end of October for the next earnings release. So thank you very much. Operator : Today's concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day!",

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter calendar year 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis as reflected in the 8-K filed yesterday. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. William Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning everyone. As we're all aware the environment has changed considerably since our last update due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority remains the safety and well-being of our employees while continuing to deliver the mission essential products and services to our customers. And I will start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication through this crisis. While we have a resilient portfolio and customer base and we're well-positioned, we're not immune to the effects of COVID-19. Despite the solid start to the year, we're trimming our outlook for revenue and earnings per share due principally to our commercial aerospace exposure and our recently completed divestiture plus some anticipated softness in international and Public Safety and potential risks from supply chain disruption. We move quickly with cost and other actions to offset these headwinds holding earnings per share within 2% of our prior guidance while increasing our margin outlook and maintaining free cash flow. Our core U.S. government business which represents about 75% of revenue is performing well and without significant challenges. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.80 up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Company margins increased 170 basis points to 17.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $533 million. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.11 driving funded backlog up 3% versus the prior year. These results were ahead of our expectations. We're actively assessing and monitoring global developments and continue to use best practices to mitigate risks related to COVID-19. We've mandated work from home for those who can, implemented social distancing, and canceled all travel and external events. In our production facilities, we've staggered work shifts, redesigned stations and implemented stringent cleaning protocols. As of today all our facilities are up and running with limited disruptions reported to date. We continue to receive a great deal of support from our key customers the DoD, the FAA, NAS and others and a large majority of our programs and facilities as well as those of our suppliers have been deemed essential to national security. The DoD has moved quickly to adjust the terms of progress payments to drive cash into the industrial base which we have passed through to our small suppliers and started a dialogue with industry on how to size and cover COVID-19 related costs. These measures combined with potential tax deferred benefits through the CARES Act provide some risk mitigation for our company and supply chain. Looking at our credit profile, our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect to have over $3.5 billion in liquidity in the form of cash on hand and revolver availability at the end of the quarter. Jay will discuss this in some more detail. In these uncertain times, we continue to execute well on the strategic priorities that we previously outlined, which is helping us deal with the crisis at hand while at the same time delivering long-term value for our shareholders. First, we continue to make great progress on integration despite the environment. Our team delivered $55 million of net synergies in Q1 from improvements in benefits in overhead costs and we now expect to achieve $165 million of incremental net savings in 2020 up versus our previous expectation of $115 million, as we accelerate savings and manage through the pandemic. And there is no change to achieving $300 million in cumulative net savings or about $500 million gross in 2021, which as we've announced before is about one-year ahead of schedule. Second, we continue to drive a culture of operational excellence deep into the company to improve quality and productivity and expand margins. This was evident in our first quarter results where we built upon last year's performance and delivered E3 savings on top of synergies offset mix headwinds. For the year, the combination of cost synergies and E3 savings allow us to increase full year margin by 25 basis points to 17.5% at the midpoint despite the cost absorption challenge from revenue headwinds and the expenses being occurred to fight the pandemic. And in our working capital we continue on the improvement trajectory from the stub year with another two-day operational reduction since year-end and about 10 days operationally since the merger close primarily from better inventory management. We believe we have the tools and proper focus to manage in the current environment leaving the path of 50 days of working capital intact for 2020. Third is to invest in technology and innovation in anticipation of customer needs to grow revenue in the long run. And we expect to sustain our industry leading spend on R&D despite the pandemic. The team is making terrific progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments, creating room in our budget to support investment in the growing pipeline of revenue synergy opportunities. We have now submitted 41 revenue synergy proposals, up 18 from last quarter with another 3 down selects out of 8 in the first quarter, primarily related to classified work in our Space and Aviation Systems segments. To-date, we've been down selected on half of the 16 proposals awarded with orders booked in the tens of millions and a lifetime revenue potential of over $2 billion. Our fourth priority is reshaping the portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth and technology differentiated businesses. And this has not changed. So far we've announced three transactions representing about 3% of revenue that will result in about a billion dollars in proceeds. Our airport security and automation business, the largest of these announcements closed yesterday with two smaller ones closing later this month and by mid-year, neither of which have a financing contingency. We're still targeting divestitures in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue including the divestitures announced to-date. And while the timing is now more fluid, we continue to have active discussions and are committed to maximizing value. And then finally, our fifth priority is to maximize cash flow to sustainably grow free cash flow per share. We're maintaining our adjusted free cash flow guide for 2020 at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and remain on track to achieve $3 billion in 2022. In the quarter, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned $883 million to shareholders, including $700 million in buybacks and dividends, and dividends which were increased 13% in the quarter. For the year, we have now assumed $1.7 billion in share repurchases including the proceeds from divestitures, which leaves us with plenty of liquidity given the environment. Moving to 2020 guidance, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% versus the prior 5% to 7% as we consider risks related to our commercial aerospace, International and Public Safety businesses due to the pandemic. On margins again, we are expanding guidance at the upper end and hovering the range to 17.4% to 17.6%, and we expect earnings per share of $11.15 to $11.55 with our free cash flow outlook unchanged. Overall I'm proud of the dedication of L3Harris employees and their commitment to the mission at hand. And I'm confident in our ability to proactively manage risk, so we can navigate these unprecedented times. So with that, let me turn over to Chris to provide an update on our operations and segment performance. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I'll start with what we're doing from an operational standpoint to mitigate business risk due to COVID-19 then shift to our operating performance and results. The management team has taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees at our over 100 facilities. We've modified the workspace especially in areas with high capacity such as our production floors in Rochester, New York and Clifton, New Jersey to either create space for individuals between workstations or to install partitions in social distancing is impossible. In addition we've adjusted our work schedules by implementing multiple shifts or staggered shifts across our company and at several of our locations that have higher risk, we have already implemented temperature checks and health screening before employees enter buildings. We provided PPE to employees, eliminating travel and taking other recommended precautions. The environment changes daily and these safety protocols are mitigating risk and continue to limit disruption for our company. Turning to the supply chain, we\u2019re managing risk daily with crossed company crisis teams established to assess and develop mitigation plans where needed. We've provided essential certification letters to all of our key suppliers globally and continue to engage in active dialogue and analysis to identify areas of vulnerability. With the recent changes by the DoD around its progress payment policy, we expect a slowdown in excess of $100 million of cash to help small businesses during these unprecedented times. As of today we've advanced approximately $80 million and expect to exceed $100 million this week. Now turning to a quarterly segment results on Slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems grew revenue 1% from a ramp in our maritime business and classified programs partially offset by timing and Electro Optical and ISR following double digit performance last year. Order momentum was broad based with a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 in every IMS sector during the quarter resulting in the overall segment 1.37 for the quarter and 1.09 since the merger. One highlight was over $800 million and award activity from our leading position on the Big Safari program. First quarter operating income was up 22% and margin expanded 260 basis points to 14.7% from operational excellence and integration benefit. On Slide 7 Space & Airborne systems revenue increased 7% in the quarter. The solid performance was driven by a production ramp and increased content on the F-35 platform as well as growth on classified programs in Intel & Cyber. Funded book-to-bill was 1.16 for the quarter and about 1.0 since the merger. In the quarter we secured our position as a prime mission integrator for our nation's space domain awareness program called Mosaic. This award is fully exercised has the potential to reach $2 billion. Segment operating income was up 12% and margin expanded 70 basis points to 18.5% driven by strong program execution and integration benefits. On Slide 8 Communication Systems revenue was up 5% for the quarter as DoD tactical benefited from modernization demand that supported weekly deliveries of the two channel multi-band radio increasing by 50% sequentially. Additionally solid growth in broadband communications partially offset by timing of sales and international tactical in prior year strength and public safety factored into the growth rate. Funded book-to-bill has a slight downshift to 0.8% in the quarter due to timing, so it's been solid at 1.03% since the merger. The awards included a $383 million sole source IDIQ from the U.S. Marines for next-generation HF radio systems as part of a multi-year modernization effort and an IDIQ for $500 million from the U.S. Space Force to provide secure and anti-jam satellite communications for the A3M program. Segment operating income was up 11% and margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.9% in the quarter from integration benefits and from strong operational performance partially offset by the mix impact from the ramp and in the tactical radio modernization program. Lastly on Slide 9, Aviation Systems revenue grew 11% in the quarter driven by our defense businesses. Orders outpaced sales on the defense side leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.05% for the quarter and 1.09% since the merger. Segment operating income was up 40% and margins expanded 300 basis points to 14.5% from improved operational efficiencies and integration of benefits. Looking ahead, we expect the headwinds on the commercial side to pick-up. As a result, we\u2019ve taken a number of measures to improve the cost structure based on the market condition. The downturn has also been triggering event that led to over $300 million of non-cash impairments for goodwill and other assets of the segment. We're committed to supporting our employees, our supply base and our customers to ensure we get through this together. With that, I'll turn it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris. I'll begin with a quick recap of first quarter results before discussing our revised outlook and liquidity position. Revenue was up 5% and EBIT increased 17% leading to EPS growth of 21% with solid margin expansion of 170 basis points, 17.5% primarily from integration savings and pension benefits. Free cash flow for the quarter was $533 million and we ended the period with 62 days in working capital before purchase accounting adjustments. Overall, solid results in the face of a tough compare and its deteriorating backdrop. Okay. Let's now turn to the 2020 outlook on Slide 10 and I'll provide more color on our updated guidance. Starting with the top line, organic revenue is now expected to be up 3% to 5% versus our original guidance of up 5% to 7% about two thirds of this comes from resetting expectations for our commercial aerospace businesses due to COVID-19 and its impact on the macro environment. When adjusting for the sale of airport security and automation, the remaining business generated about $800 million in sales in 2019 tied to commercial aerospace through training in avionics equipment. Commercial training represents roughly 40% of the sales and includes the manufacturing of simulators and training of new pilots, as well as those of airlines. And within avionics we manufacture and service a number of components including collision avoidance systems, transponders, as well as voice and data recorders. These businesses are tied to broader aviation trends, including air traffic, airline profitability and OEM production rates, which are all under pressure. For instance, IATA has forecasted traffic to be down nearly 50% for the year. As a result, our guidance now reflects approximately $500 million in revenues or a reduction of about half of the sales for the remainder of the year, when compared to 2019 In addition we factored in pressures at our public safety radio's business which in 2019 had $500 million in sales. This business is focused on state and local municipalities in North America which are facing budget and operational constraints due to the pandemic leading to an over 10% decline relative to our prior expectation of low single digit growth. Finally on the international front which comprises roughly 20% of our sales we are now assuming a more flattish outlook versus an increase in the low to mid-single digits previously. In contrast we expect higher revenues from our DOD businesses including tactical radios and ISR. On a margin outlook Bill talked about the acceleration of integration and productivity benefits that drive that 25 basis points increase in our margin guide of 17.5% putting us at the upper end of the prior range. And that's net of approximately 30 basis points of headwinds associated with fixed cost absorption from volume declines that we've offset with expense reductions bringing this down to our full year EPS we now see $11.15 to $11.55 or $11.35 at the midpoint down $0.20 as compared to our prior guide midpoint. The range is premised on 270 million shares inclusive of the $1.7 billion in share buybacks noted earlier and a 17% tax rate and bridging EPS it to our prior guide on Slide 12 we were $0.15 in headwinds from the timing of divestitures and repurchases while the $0.52 in COVID related headwinds are merely offset by incremental synergies and improved performance from midpoint to midpoint. Finally a quick note on the profile of EPS for the remainder of the year we expect the pandemic related impact to be most notable in the second quarter with stronger growth anticipated in the second half. Moving to free cash flow our guide up $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion is intact and so is the multi-year outlook. For this year our cash flow is bolstered by accelerated synergies, federal stimulus and cost takeout, which will offset the reduced revenues discussed earlier. In our working capital, we'll also look to manage the environment for a three-day goal of improvement in 2020 remains in place as well. Moving over to liquidity, as Bill noted earlier we remain in a strong position. We ended the first quarter with over $400 million of cash on hand, net of the April debt maturity and a $2 billion untapped credit revolver. We're looking ahead to the end of the second quarter our liquidity should reach over $3.5 billion post divestitures which would include at least $1.5 billion in cash and full access to the revolver. Also our net debt maturity of $650 million isn't due until early 2021 and our balance sheet is healthy at 2 times leverage. Now switching to the segment outlook, we've narrowed our integrated Mission Systems revenue range to be up 5.5% to 7% versus the prior 5% to 7% guidance during primarily by strength in our ISR business. Segment operating margin is projected to be about 13.5% or 25 basis point increase from the previous midpoint reflecting performance to date and increased synergy benefits. Next Space and Airborne systems also narrowed our revenue range a 6% to 7.5% growth driven by modernization and sustainment on the F-35 platform in Mission avionics. Segment operating margin is expected to be 18.75% and is unchanged at the midpoint. Communication Systems revenue is now expected to be up between 3.5% to 5% versus the prior guide of 6.5% to 8.5% this reflects headwinds in our public safety business of about 1.5 points and a reduction of international volumes in tactical radios and in integrated vision. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be about 23.75% that's up 100 basis points relative to the prior midpoint reflecting increased cost and integration benefits. And finally in Aviation Systems we're forecasting an organic revenue decline of 1% to 5% year-over-year primarily from the factors I noted earlier in commercial aerospace. This points to reported revenues of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year post divestitures. On the commercial side, revenues are set to be down around 35% organically for the year and for government related businesses which include mission networks, military training and defense aviation products, they are expected to be up in the mid to high single digits. Segment operating margins are expected to be approximately 13.25% down versus the prior guide by 75 basis points from the midpoint, due primarily to fixed cost absorption from the volume declines partially offset by cost actions. The margin guide also accounts for the airport security and automation divestiture we closed yesterday. So to summarize and put it all together, overall pullback in our outlook, but one with a pandemic related impacts have been nearly offset by management actions with the remainder being the result of a more flexible approach to capital deployment in this environment. With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland : Just a quick clarification and a question I wondered Jay if you could give us a little bit more color on the cash bridge on the guidance for all the moving pieces with AS and tax and suppliers and progress payments and synergies. I think that would help everyone and just bigger picture Bill or Chris you know with respect to how the business, the combined business is evolving? I mean you highlighted the synergy opportunities, the revenue synergy opportunities you look at that opportunity pipeline. You look at what the business is going to look like in the wake of COVID-19. How does all of this influence your thoughts on portfolio and shaping and whatnot, any updated thoughts there would be great? Thanks. Jay Malave : Sure, Carter. Let me start with the free cash flow, as we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we have the benefit of the progress payments going from 80% to 90%. That an excess of around $100 million that's being slowed down to the suppliers, and so net-net that's a very little impact. There is a benefit and stimulus related to taxes, which is helping us offset some of the other impacts across the business. But when you take a look at net income, that is moving, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we've largely offset that. And so, with the benefit of the stimulus efforts, we're just holding that as a placeholder. We may have to go deeper into supplier payments. We may have to think about our pension contributions and things like that. But for the most part, we've held the working capital intact after three days. Net income is a little bit lower. We're getting benefits from the stimulus efforts and we're just kind of holding that as a placeholder for other things for later in the year. William Brown : And Carter on your question on - for the long-term outlook, look we're very pleased with the progress of the integration so far, the cost synergies are going very, very well. We're finding great opportunities and revenue opportunities and it's testament to the power of the combined portfolio as we laid out 18 months ago, when we announced the merger. And the areas that we could offer new mission sets to our customers and the COVID-19 notwithstanding, it's playing out as we had expected. We have much more powerful competitive offering and it's helping us quite substantially in mitigating some of the risks that we\u2019re seeing coming through in small parts of the portfolio now through the pandemic. Now in the portfolio shaping we've been at this now for 18 months, we've made some good progress here. We've about a third of the way through in terms of the revenue we anticipated, divesting. We had sized that for investors back in early February that was pre-COVID. We keep looking at the portfolio, it's an ongoing process, but we're going to shape our decisions on what is in our portfolio based on long-term strategy. Our ability to differentiate via technology, ability to grow and win in those segments and that hasn't changed based on the pandemic. We continue to look at that. I don\u2019t know Chris if you wanted to maybe augment with that. Chris Kubasik : Carter I\u2019ll just chime in that when I look at our new business opportunities and some of the things we're currently working on I continue to believe our portfolio is well aligned with our customers focus and desire. You hear a lot about multi-function systems which we are currently implementing in space. We are submitting white papers on ABMS and of course the Navy's coming out with an offering or and RFP on Spectral. So I think we're well aligned there on the capability front. And then the modular open system architecture I think the F-35 is a good example of those capabilities. So I think it positions us well for the long-term. Operator : Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : So Bill, just wanted to ask on working capital progress. It doesn't sound like the progress payment change benefited you at all in Q1. But you got two days of sequential improvement I think you\u2019d talked about that in Q1 you might have given back some of the upside that you saw in early collections in Q4. And so, maybe just comment on that and I think from here you're only assuming about one day of additional working capital improvement through the rest of the year? Thanks. William Brown : Yes David that's all factual prog pay did really - it benefited us in the first quarter. It\u2019s really just starting now in some ways. It's not a big part of our portfolio it's only about 7% of our revenue so you're not going to see big numbers. And as Jay and others and Chris pointed out what we're receiving from the government through progress payment acceleration we're flowing that out to the supplier base. So that net-net won't be a factor in the year. So we're making good progress. So two days sequentially 10 days operationally since the beginning of when we closed on the merger it's - I think it's just fantastic work that the team has done. A lot of it's coming out of inventory. We're seeing some opportunities elsewhere, but a lot of inventory coming out as we've been pointing out to investors for some time. And we're expecting maybe another day towards the balance of the year. There's some purchase accounting opportunities here if you will, in the year. So we'll end this year below 60 probably in a 58 day range. And as we look out the next couple of years again three to four days per year in 2021 three or four days in 2022. So we - see ourselves around 50 days of working capital by the time we get out into 2022 which as you know we\u2019re still about five days higher than our peers were at the end of 2019 and about 10 days higher than where Harris was before we closed on the transaction. So, we still see some good opportunities to continue to drive working capital performance beyond 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : On the adjustment to the aviation guidance for the year I was wondering if you could elaborate on whether this has resulted from the order intake or the conversations with your customers or whether it is your best estimate at this stage is relatively early days. And in relation to that Chris, I was wondering if you could comment on what sort of flexibility you have to reallocate cost or capacity in the aerospace business to defense or elsewhere? Thank you. William Brown : So Rob really on both I mean Jay went through the details I think pretty carefully in his script. So the business that was $800 million going down to $500 million so down 40%. We talked about the components to be very clear. Training is about 40% you know effectively what - and that we see being down 40%, 45% for the year. But in fact what we\u2019ve done is that we won't sell any new full flight simulators beyond Q1, so we sort of zero that out that could be conservative. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed so far, it is through conversations with the airlines, with OEMs, it's really pretty detailed bottoms up analysis that the team has done and really is worked on over the last four to six weeks. I think he's done a good job on that, 60% of the businesses is avionics we see that business down for the year around 30%. But it's got several components, there's a commercial OE and aftermarket component that obviously that's going to be down substantially based on line race that we're hearing from Airbus and Boeing based on I added data on our RPK. There's a piece of it that provides military avionics. In other words it provides avionics on a commercial platform that's military in use that's relatively stable, which is why avionics isn't being hit quite as much as you might expect. So for the year, we've got quite a bit of the back end of the year in backlog we're watching this very, very carefully watching order intake rate. And we think based on what we see today, we've sized it appropriately, again but it's a very, very volatile environment and we're watching it very closely. Now let maybe Chris talk about some of the shifts that are happening in the workforce. Chris Kubasik : Yes, good morning, Robert. We\u2019ve taken the actions in commercial aviation to reduce the cost with the operating expense maybe down $20 million for the remainder of the year. And we've been pretty aggressive with reductions enforced and furloughs. But to your question specifically on the engineering front as of today we have over 50 engineers that were working on the avionics products that have been redeployed to DoD work. And now that we're all learning how to work remotely and, a little more creatively not many of those individuals needed to relocate. So, I think it's a good story relative to the engineering talent. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Just a couple of questions. First on communications systems I was wondering in the revised guidance sort of what\u2019s the anticipated or in tactical RF change relative to what the prior was? And at PSPC you know how much of a lingering drag beyond 2020 do you anticipate being as a result of the recession? William Brown : So Gautam I\u2019ll. You know let me touch on both of those pieces. So overall tactic we had I think a pretty good start to the year we're up 12%. The DOD was really strong international was down mid-teens and pretty close to what we had expected it will be down that same range in the second quarter as well recovering in the back half. You'll start to see a little softer year-over-year growth in DOD simply because of the tough compare. So now what we see international to be is roughly flat for the year before we thought it would be up low to mid-single digit so call that 3% so now about flat. You know in that flatness we still see the APAC or Asia-Pacific region up low double digits Central Asia up significantly you know because of Afghanistan and some of the drawdown that\u2019s happening there. You know we still see Middle East Africa to be up low single digits but that has come down from the last guidance. So Europe will be down mid-single digits. We know Western Europe is getting a little bit better. Eastern Europe still going to be down. And then that's really - those really the bigger pieces here. Central America is roughly flat and Canada is going to be down as we had expected in the year. So overall, we still see DoD being up, in fact a little bit better, up low to mid-teens around 14%. Now we know we see international being about flat. On Public Safety, we've had a very good run here, over the last six quarters to eight quarters have been very, very strong. There's been growing like last year was close to 20% growth. Margins were coming up. We've got a great product line better quality, really good execution. So we felt very good about that. This year we were guiding to low single digits, which is in line with the LMR growth rate in North America. You know as Jay pointed out, you know down more than 10 points from that, so call it down 10%, so it's about $60 million of revenue erosion. You know we'll see that pretty prominently here in the second quarter and probably you'll see it'll - about the same to the balance of the year, it's going to be a pretty tough back end of the year for Public Safety. I think beyond 2020, it depends on what happens to the economy, state and tax - state and local tax revenues. Right now we're fighting in Q2 not just a revenue impact, but just the fact that you have the states and localities dealing with coded and not able to work, doing an installed system that's Public Safety. So we're hopeful, we could get a little better in 2021, but it's too soon to say that, got them. Gautam Khanna : Now that\u2019s a very helpful overview. And then just maybe I missed that the integration, Integrated Vision Systems, what\u2019s going on there, in terms of decline, maybe I missed a misheard you in the opening remarks, but what sort of, what changed? William Brown : You\u2019re talking about IMS, the Integrated Missions Systems business? Chris Kubasik : Integrated Vision. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Is there any\u2026 William Brown : Oh, Integrated Vision, the night vision business? Gautam Khanna : Integrated Vision Systems, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not IMS segment? William Brown : Yes. Integrated Vision Systems is performing well on the ENVG program. We're meeting our delivery schedules and looking forward to additional opportunities later in the year that's more domestically. I think that the question is probably related to some of the opportunities we have in the Middle East and we talked about you know more conservatism in the Mideast. We have not had any cancellations. What we're seeing are delays or holdups. And I think a lot of that has just ties to the several factors. You know the export approval process including congressional notification is a whole new process and it's all being done remotely and virtually. And some of our international customers are working remotely. Some have closed their ministries and some actually have curfews in place. We just see all those items contributing to more of a timing issues, so we reduced the outlook there if that helps. Chris Kubasik : But still it's still lower to mid-single digits in night vision for the year. Gautam Khanna : And that was compared to what it was the prior? Chris Kubasik : It was in the low double-digits. Operator : Our next question is Doug Harned with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : You know when you when you talk about the about the synergies you're ahead of plan $165 million that synergies for 2020 and you've had the - and you've also had I would assume some impediments from COVID-19. I mean this seems like awfully good progress. I mean how does this give you more optimism when you look at that $300 million net synergy total overall. And I'd say that from two things. One is you're ahead of plan here, but also you're ahead of plan and perhaps you could have even done better had you not had the COVID-19 issues? Jay Malave : Yes. We're making really good progress here Doug. Look we did move forward the $500 million, $300 million net, which we had expected in calendar 2022 to calendar 2021. So we're not going to be done at the end of 2021. We're going to continue working this into 2022, and will become part of normal operations. So we do expect that the ultimate synergy value coming out of this merger is going to be beyond the $500 million and $300 million we've talked about previously because we're seeing it already it\u2019s coming forward and it's likely to go up. So we had $65 million in a stub year, we start out of the gauge very, very quickly. I wouldn\u2019t say it was conservatism coming into this year, but we were still a fairly new company. There were a lot of moving parts in the year. We guided to an incremental $115 million in net synergies earlier this year that's getting quite a bit better, more visibility that we're seeing right now in indirect spend. We've seen the consolidation of all of our benefits programs now being completely implemented. All of the CHQ and segment consolidations are now essentially done. We're just seeing just better progress. So is there any impact from COVID it is probably on the fringes there are going to be some issues that we might have that are already embedded in these numbers that we're talking about here, Doug. Some of the opportunities are really supply chain related they may slip out a little bit, but we feel very good about the trajectory we happen to be on. We've got a very seasoned integration team people that know how to work and drive their jobs in and are doing a great job remotely. So we feel good about this. And if anything we have maybe a little more opportunity in the year as opposed to risk. Operator : Our next question is Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Noah Poponak : Bill just trying to rethink through the 2022 $3 billion free cash flow target as we all do every quarter. And at one point it looked pretty conservative. It's now taken the hit of you know if you're going to divest 8% to 10% of the revenues, and then if there is still aerospace coronavirus impacts that far out. But you're reiterating 2020 with the business so to lay those out of the free cash flow and then the reset the aerospace businesses and then the $3 billion is kind of 5% or 6% growth each of the next two years. So I guess one, just kind of high level, do you still view that number as having some conservatism in it or is it just sort of hanging on despite the hits that it's taken and specifically in the aerospace businesses, do those need to recover by then to get to the $3 billion, or it can they actually just walk along the bottom and you can still get to the $3 billion? Chris Kubasik : Well, let me start here Noah. Again $3 billion as Bill mentioned is premised on us being able to continue to get improvement in the working capital to around run the 50 days. We still see in spite of the business where things are today, the path to be able to deliver that. We've identified the opportunities in a lot of that as Bill mentioned is sitting in inventory and a lot of those benefits weren't necessarily pegged to the commercial business or some of it that was there and yes, we'll see it that at the lower cash flow projection than we otherwise would have before the COVID-19 in commercial. But we have the runway and in working capital to be able to do that. As Bill mentioned, we see the path, it's not going that it's certainly it\u2019s going to be more challenging than it was before, but I wouldn't care - I wouldn't characterize it as hanging on. I would say that perhaps our buffer our questions is a little bit lower than it was before, but - but the path is still very clear to us. Noah Poponak : Okay, that's really helpful. And Jay just a quick follow-up on the free cash flow and any ability to articulate to us what you know ongoing seasonality through the year should be because I - if I remember correctly you had discussed pulling some forward into the fourth quarter of 2019, but then the first quarter of 2020 is better than expected. I know you have some, I know there is a lot of moving pieces in there, but should the free cash flow through the years going forward be relatively level loaded or should it be a pretty steep ramp through the year? Jay Malave : It's probably somewhere a mix between the two. It's been kind of back end loaded over the past number of years I would say in 2019, even 2019 was a little bit more level loaded. This year you know $533 million is a pretty consistent with what we did for the two companies combined last year. And so our goal is to make it more linear throughout the year, but I think there is some natural level of linearity in there we're probably be still a little bit more back end loaded there. So yes it'll still probably stay a little back end loaded, but again a lot better than it's been historically in 2019 I think was started that. Operator : Our next question Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning Bill, Chris and Jay and thanks for the time. The growth is muted in 2020 at 3% to 5% organic and just from what we've become accustomed to I understand aviation has two points of that headwind. I guess how do we think about some of the revenue capture opportunities and timing whether it's the 41 proposals you mentioned and the three incremental down flex this quarter and or how the core business just accelerates in 2020 and 2021. Chris Kubasik : Sheila, thanks so much for the question. The revenue synergies you know rolling out over the next probably 12 to 18 months. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, orders are in the tens of millions they could grow more substantial in 2021 and 2022 they required that were down select. They have to be then finally awarded and they start to build in time again year and a half order or so. So yes, we're down we're at 3% to 5% this year. The defense business remains very good for us, it's up around 8% you know international is as Jay mentioned we're flattish, but the commercial part of the portfolio which is aerospace public safety is going to be down more than 20%. So the defense piece, the core defense part of the organization is very healthy it's high single-digits. And as we look out over in the next year, we you know we've got, we see you know good bookings this year. We see a very good pipeline about $64 billion of pipeline of opportunities; it's up about 8% since we closed on the merger. We have revenue synergy opportunities are starting to kick in. So I see us getting back in 2021, 2022 to more in that mid-single-digit range. We'll see how the next nine months play out this year and what happens with the COVID pandemic, but in the budget process beyond 2021. But you know I think things should recover, we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape beyond this year. Operator : Our next question Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Sorry, we have lost his line. We\u2019ll move to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed. Jon Raviv : Bill and Jay, can you talk about capital allocation, I do certainly appreciate the message around growing free cash flow per share, and how repurchases is a big tool for you guys. But can you address that tool in an environment where potentially the norm can move against repurchases, what else could you do with cash in that kind of dynamic? Jay Malave : Well, look, I mean, for - at the moment Jon I mean, our overall philosophy on capital deployment really hasn't changed. We're going to drive and generate substantial free cash. We're going to pay an attractive dividend that has a payout ratio in the 30% to 35% range; we saw back in February raised a dividend by 13%, 10% back in August last year. So we\u2019ll continue to be committed to paying an attractive dividend. We don't have our leverage ratio as Jay pointed out is pretty attractive. Anything debt that's coming due will likely be refinanced, so that will be a pull on cash. We don't see pension contributions for probably another year or two depending upon what happens in rates and returns this year. So it does leave a lot of capacity for deployment. And at the moment, we're still committed to returning that to shareholders in the form of repurchases. I have mentioned in my remarks for the year we're going to be a $1.7 billion. So we\u2019ll return the $1 billion in proceeds from selling SDS. Beyond that we'll pause it, but then you have a tremendous amount of capacity back into the year a lot of the liquidity and I see the sort of normalizing as we get into calendar 2021. Operator : Our next question Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ron Epstein : You\u2019ve mentioned the $64 billion of opportunities now with the joint company. Can you talk about some of those that are more due to your term? I think we can keep an eye on it to keep score on how you're doing relative to the $64 million opportunities. Chris Kubasik : Good morning Ron, it's Chris. We have several opportunities that I think are a little more significant you can track later in the third quarter of the current plan is for the Next Gen Jammer contract to be awarded the competitive opportunity. I think that will be an interesting to watch. We've talked a lot about our responsive satellites. We've been getting orders and continue to get orders on those satellites. So you can track that. On the ISR front you know we've talked a lot about the Peregrine program in Australia that will have follow-on opportunities but we also have comparable opportunities in Italy and elsewhere around the world. The EW capabilities are reined UAE comes to mind. Clearly the tactical radios we have a fair amount to go here in 2020. And then even on the international front, we're on the maritime theme with a variety of OEMs and ship builders from Romania to Taiwan to Australia, so you will be able to track those or highlight those as the couple to follow on. Ron Epstein : And if I may just a follow on quickly, do you guys have a position on the Frigate program that was just awarded to Finmeccanica and [indiscernible]. William Brown : Yes, great question. We have you know there were four beds and given our capabilities we were on all four of the teams. So as you would imagine, I think we're well-positioned with Finmeccanica marine and more to come on that. Usually they pick the frigate first and then the second tier suppliers are negotiated and competed, but we feel very comfortable with our capabilities and being able to participate on that program. Operator : Our next question is Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Good morning, Bill, Chris and Jay. Bill you gave us some color on the international just flat for the year, I mean what kind of visibility to have our conversations with your customers I know Chris mentioned that there's some export offices are closed or some customers are even closed just thinking about growth actually exit you know COVID-19 worldwide what people kind of focus you need to see in the second half of this year. Thanks. William Brown : Well, we said we think the revenue in international will be roughly flattish year, so clearly you know booking some of the orders that are important back have will require engaging with customers happening today via phone, but we\u2019re going to sort of start to see an ability to key customers to demonstrate product sign contracts and that's going to require some face to face conversation. So there's a lot of dialogue happening right now. We're trying to get a sense for the timing of some of the opportunities we have in the back end of the year. We think it was appropriate given some of the short-term nature of the opportunities in tactical - and make sure optical to pull that out as which will be done here to recalibrate international for the year. But as this thing starts to open up, we've got a pretty good team internationally and - they're out there, meeting with their customers, talking to their customers and we'll see, as we get towards the back end of the year, how the orders flow through. Peter Arment : Okay, thanks. Just a quick follow-up Chris, is there any incoming - from the Wescam, regarding just from a demography perspective, just an opportunity in the COVID-19 world? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes, the Wescam business is doing quite well. I think, if you're referring to doing some sort of thermal imaging or such, it's really not at that price point, its better sticking with their core market and focused on the airborne assets. So, hope that answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski at Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Pete Skibitski : Bill something I've been curious about kind of top level, is this topic of 5G, and I know it's obviously kind of a commercial standard, but I've also seen you mentioned that DoD is running some pilot projects related to 5G as well. So I'm just curious, if you can give us your thoughts from a top level on whether or not this impacts L3Harris in any way, kind of and/or if we feel like it's a technology you need to be involved in developing or in some other way? Thanks. William Brown : Yes Pete, look it's a good question, I won't be able to give you a complete fulsome answer on this, but we've had - an internal team focused on 5G. We're not an inventor, but we certainly have applications that are using 5G technology, so we do play in the space. We need to be present in the area. We need to find DoD or defense related applications of 5G, it's going to affect Warfighter effectiveness. So we do have specific activities here. I wouldn\u2019t say it's a big driver this year, but certainly over time it's a core capability that we need to have as a leader in spectrum superiority. So clearly Pete that's - it's something that is central to our strategy over the next several years. Pete Skibitski : Okay, more to come, thanks for the color. William Brown : More to come. Operator : Our next question Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Maybe Bill - in addition to the higher progress payments the DoD seems to be also biding pretty aggressive on pulling forward contract awards and getting kind of the money out of the hands of the DoD and obligating that as quick as they can. I'm just curious did you see that in the quarter obviously good booking at SAS and IMS or is that something that might help bookings continued to be strong in second quarter and third quarter? William Brown : Look Myles it\u2019s a good question, credit due to the folks in DoD really across the services we've had very active dialogue both Chris and I and some others on the team with a lot of leaders across DoD and across the services. And they've been very aggressive not just on prog pay, but accelerating awards. You probably heard you know Hondo at the Navy accelerating quite substantially awards. So we did see some opportunities move left some out of Q2 into Q1 some out of the back half of the year into the front half. Chris mentioned A3M that's an opportunity we saw an acceleration of an opportunity in IMS the Virginia AMP. So we did see some opportunities moving left and I think that we'll continue to see that it's you know the DoD is really focused on this. They are trying to put money on contract that we then quickly then put suppliers on contracts. So we keep not just cash flowing, but opportunities flowing into the supply base. So certainly something we're all focused on. Myles Walton : Okay. And clarification Jay on the slide on the lock of EPS, there's pension called out under operations another $0.28, how much of that $0.28 is pension? Jay Malave : About $0.10 in that $0.28, there is a lot of moving parts in there. But the pension is incremental about $25 million. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Just as - I guess as you guys are thinking about COVID related impacts disruptions any other color that you have on your broader supply chain. I mean you guys are pretty technology driven I'm sure there's a lot of smaller components, subsystems, discrete electronics you're procuring? Are you seeing any potential risk either from parts procured and the Asia-Pacific geography or how are you kind of sizing that potential risk as you go forward here any need to build buffer stock of inventory on certain maybe at risk product lines? Chris Kubasik : Yes great, great question, this is Chris. On any given day, there is tens of millions of revenue risk it changes on a weekly basis. We really started looking at this back in January in the Asian markets I think we've been able to mitigate all that risk. And a lot of this depends on the countries India shuts down, Mexico shuts down, we have to monitor those suppliers look for second sources, but I think we're doing a real good job. We have a dedicated team focus specifically on COVID supply chain and Bill and I gets daily updates on the progress. So great question, we're trying to use predictive analysis, identify the risks and mitigate it on a regular basis, hope that helps. Operator : And our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Two quick things, Bill on the state and local budget constraints you talked about before in public safety. How do you think about, how the crisis may have revealed any shortcomings in the public safety communications and what might be the opportunity coming out of this thing? And then I have a higher level question, just on budget austerity and how you and Chris think about the possibility that some you know that the budget the defense budget at some point will be funding stimulus repayment that sort of thing, not necessarily what we saw 10 years ago, but some kind of shift in spending priorities at the federal level couple years down the road? William Brown : So hey, look really good questions, on public safety i.e. this could drive an accelerated shift from LMR to LTE that's been gaining some steam with FirstNet. Fortunately we've got a radio that is LMR LTE capable both qualifiable by ATT and Verizon. So I think we're really well-positioned for that transition. I think that having a domestic supply base here is important in that particular area. We have certain technology and applications that could allow us to open up new markets that go beyond first responders to healthcare providers that we've seen that happen over the last couple of months. So the state and local finances I think will be impacted in the near to medium-term and we've tried to capture that in our thoughts, but it could drive an acceleration from LMR to LTE. And relative to your question on the budget, so as you know the 2021 budget came out a couple of months ago from the President including I think 2% per year growth in the fight that obviously was all pre-COVID. Lot discussion happening right now between the authorizer and the appropriators of what the budget will be for 2021, it - came out about flattish from the President. A lot of the things that we're focused on are well funded and in that including a lot of the classified budgets look pretty good. There's $135 billion of - so if you will surplus investment account funding that still remains out there it\u2019s going to provide a little bit of tailwind to us. As you gotten to 2022 beyond 2022 into 2023 you've got an election year. Eventually you got a $4 trillion deficit that know going to have to be sort of paid for in some ways, but at the same time you got a very dangerous world you could see what the North Koreans are doing, what the Iranians are doing, what Chinese are doing and Russia. So we're going to continue to be tested. The threats remain there and the investments that the DoD is trying to make are really long-term investments in technology back to sustain beyond the next couple of years. And I'm hopeful that that will be a bipartisan alignment to make sure we continue to fund the DoD. So thanks very much for that question, Rob. I appreciate that. William Brown : So thank you all for joining the call this morning. During these uncertain times, we're managing risks aggressively and taking appropriate actions to drive value for all of our shareowners. I hope we\u2019ll soon be operating under more favorable conditions. I want to close by thanking our employees for going above and beyond to support our customers and our essential missions as well as the healthcare workers first responders and everyone in the frontline fighting COVID-19. Thank you all. And be safe. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Second Quarter Calendar Year 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking L3Harris employees for their hard work and dedication of over the last several months. The pandemic has challenged us all to find new ways of working effectively. And our team has responded well to ensure we continue to meet the mission critical needs of our customers even as the virus spreads across southern states, where we have a large presence. And as the environment evolves, the health and safety of our employees will remain our top priority. All of our facilities are up and running and adhering to well-established protocols such as daily health screenings, face coverings, social distancing and adjusted work schedules. Our work from home policy remains in place for about half our workforce. And we are prepared to operate under these conditions over the coming quarters. We continue to pay close attention to our supply base and monitor our risk position daily and we've successfully implemented mitigation plans where needed, including developing alternative sourcing, providing on-site assistance and working with local authorities to secure closure exemptions. In addition, we accelerated nearly $250 million in supplier payments within the quarter and we plan to continue that support through year end. We're also doing our fair share to support our communities' health care workers and first responders through the pandemic. And we continue to hire aggressively to meet our growth needs, adding about 3,000# employees through June and bringing on board our largest cohort of interns and new college grads ever. Chris and Jay will walk through the details in a minute but as you saw earlier today we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.83, up a solid 13% against a tough backdrop. Company margins increased 150 basis points to 18.2% and adjusted free cash flow was $785 million, all above expectations. Reported revenue was flat but adjusted for divestitures was up about 2.5% as strong 8% growth in our core U.S. government-related businesses more than offset a modest decline on the international side and a 35% drop in our small commercial businesses, consistent with what we anticipated. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.09 with funded backlog growing about 5% since the beginning of the year when adjusted for divestitures. Our strategic priorities have remained the same since we closed on the merger a year ago. And we're proud that our nearly 50,000 employees quickly aligned as one operating company. And we're pleased with how well the team is executing and avoiding operational missteps despite the many moving parts. Integration continues to progress well with net synergy savings of $60 million in the quarter and $115 million year-to-date. We have not seen a slowdown in activity due to COVID and now believe we can deliver $185 million in net savings this year, up $20 million from prior estimate, largely due to a steady ramp in savings from the supply chain, shared services and benefits. Our integration roadmap is very methodical and rigorous with a weekly cadence of top-down reviews and we continue to expect to achieve $300 million in cumulative net savings in calendar 2021, one year ahead of original plan. We're making good progress and driving a culture of operational excellence deep into the company and through the quarter, we continue to hold training sessions and conduct lean assessments, quality clinics and value engineering events despite the inability to travel. As we've said before, e3savings are additive to synergies and we're a key part of the margin expansion we achieved in the quarter and year-to-date. But more importantly are essential to expanding margins beyond the integration window. Investments in technology and innovation remain at the top of our agenda and are key to long-term revenue growth. Since the closing, we fully implemented a rigorous stage gate process called Checkpoint and cut 30% of IRAD projects to sharpen our focus on key strategic themes around spectrum superiority, actionable intelligence and war fighter effectiveness, while positioning for the shift to an integrated networked battlefield. We are investing heavily in multi-function, software-defined, open architecture systems that allow us to deliver mission solutions independent of the platform. These investments are evident and are increasing traction on revenue synergies; we've now been down selected on 13 out of 23 proposals and continued to build on our multi-billion pipeline. While we're still in the early innings, the collaboration we're seeing across segments is really impressive with the process to identify new revenue synergy opportunities nearly self-sustaining. On portfolio reshaping, we are set to close today on the divestiture of EOTech, a small consumer-facing business bringing total transactions to date to four with proceeds exceeding $1 billion. We're now about one-third of the way toward our bottoms-up estimate of divesting 8% to 10% of revenue with more progress expected in the coming quarters as we increase our focus on businesses where we're best positioned to win. And on maximizing cash generation, we delivered $785 million of free cash flow in the quarter and about $2.7 billion on a LTM basis, growth of over 20% on a per share basis. Our strong performance along with divestiture proceeds drove a cash balance of $2 billion at quarter end and supports our prior commitment to return capital to shareholders in the third quarter. Longer term, we see a clear path to achieving $3 billion free cash flow in calendar 2022, driven in part by continued improvement in working capital. In the quarter, we achieved another two day sequential improvement with solid momentum toward a calendar 2022 goal of sub 50-days from 68 at merger close adjusted for divestitures and accounting items. Slide 4 illustrates the opportunity ahead of us. 10 businesses account for about 75% of our working capital, six of which have more than 75 days on hand, driving those six the current company average of 55 days would generate nearly $0.5 billion of cash flow with the largest opportunity tied to lower inventory. Shorter cycle times, better forecasting, product rationalization and part commonization, vendor managed inventory and improved supplier delivery performance. The levers are clear. We've done it before and the team is focused and motivated to get it done. Finally, we're all watching carefully the progress towards a 2021 defense budget and signals from Congress, the Biden campaign and the Trump administration on the budget trajectory in 2022 and beyond. We're encouraged by the bipartisan support in advancing the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act through the house and senate and we believe that the heightened threat environment will drive the trajectory of U.S military spending regardless of the election. And while we're conscious of the risks surrounding elevated deficits, we believe our technological capabilities and opportunity set position as well over the coming years. Recent house and senate marks support this as we saw ongoing strength in areas like tactical radio, aircraft ISR, F-35 and space and classified budgets are also set to be well supported. So between budget positioning, revenue synergies, margin expansion potential and shareholder friendly capital deployment, we remain confident in our ability to sustain double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth per share in the medium term. And with that I'll now turn it over to Chris Kubasik to discuss segment results. Chris? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. I'd like to highlight the quarterly segment results starting on slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems increased revenue 7% from growth in our Electro Optical and Maritime Businesses with ISR relatively flat in the quarter, but expected to pick up in the back half of the year. Operating income was up 38% and margin expanded 370 basis points to 16.8% from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with a funded book- to-bill above 1.0 in each business resulting in an overall segment book-to-bill of 1.19 for the quarter and 1.12 since the merger. Our highlight in recent months has been the traction we've seen in our maritime business. In the quarter, we received an order from a classified customer for an unmanned surface vehicle. And just this month, we were selected as the prime contractor for the medium unmanned surface vehicle for the U.S navy. We're also in the process of finalizing our position on the U.S navy's frigate program as a system integrator this initial 10-ship contract has a potential value of over $300 million. So clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in this business. On slide 7, Space and Airborne Systems revenue increased 4% in the quarter. Growth in Avionics from the production and modernization ramp of the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and cyber were partially offset by program transition timing and a tough compare in the space business. Segment operating income was up 3% and margin contracted 20 basis points to 18.8% as operational excellence and integration benefits were offset by program mix from increased developmental work and investments in earlier stage technologies. Overall funded book-to-bill was 0.94 for the quarter and just below 1 since the merger, with particular strength in space, which delivered a book-to-bill over 1.0 in the quarter. As a reminder, in our space business, we are transitioning from a legacy exquisite payload provider to a full end-to-end systems provider for responsive satellite and ground systems. A recent launch for the U.S Air Force demonstrated this capability. We designed, developed and built satellites within a couple years and are now providing the tasking and the command and control for these on-orbit spacecraft. This speed to market is a significant differentiator compared to legacy systems that take nearly a decade to become operational. As war fighting capabilities accelerate in the space domain, we are well positioned to participate and capture new business and have a strong pipeline that exceeds $10 billion to support growth in the medium and long term. On slide 8, Communication Systems revenue was up 2.5% for the quarter as DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from modernization demand, both were up double digits. This strength was partially offset by international tactical radio sales timing and headwinds at our public safety business both of which were down in the mid-teens consistent with prior expectations. Segment operating income was up 11% and margin expanded 190 basis points to 23.9% from integration benefits and cost management. Turning to orders, DoD tactical modernization momentum continued with a $95 million award for an additional low rate production contract on the US army's HMS Manpack. After completion of the operational testing early next year, we anticipate a full rate production award against the previously announced IDIQ of nearly $13 billion. This will support continued revenue growth. Lastly on slide 9, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 7% in the quarter with commercial aviation down about 50% due to the pandemic in line with our expectations. This headwind was partially offset by continued growth within the classified areas at defense aviation products, which was up in the mid-teens. Operating income was down 8% primarily due to the impact of divestitures, but would have grown 4% otherwise. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 12.5% from operational efficiencies, integration benefits and cost actions, partially offset by COVID related headwinds. Orders significantly outpaced sales leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.26 for the quarter and 1.13 since the merger. We saw considerable traction on the defense side for airborne radars, ground vehicle systems and training solutions, as well as within the classified arena. One of the key wins in the quarter was the $900 million single award IDIQ to develop and manage simulator requirements and standards across the Air Force's training portfolio. This solution will leverage open systems architecture and set common standards for the Air Force and aligns with the DoD move towards multi-domain operations and ties to the program direction of JAB C2. It will also position us well for future military training offerings. So before handing it over to Jay, I'd like to echo Bill's comments and thank our employees for their dedication, focus and hard work during the pandemic. We'll continue to prioritize your health and safety as we move forward. With that over to you Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of second quarter results then provide an update on the impact of COVID and then wrap up with guidance. In the quarter, organic revenue was up nearly 2.5% as 8% growth in our US government business more than offset the commercial decline. EBIT increased 9% on 18.2% margins resulting in EPS growth of 13% or 0.32 as shown on slide 10. Of this growth $0.22 came from synergies, $0.15 from operations including cost management and $0.13 from share count, pension and other items including divestitures, partially offset by pandemic related headwinds of $0.18 mainly from our commercial businesses. Free cash flow for the quarter was $785 million and we ended the period with 55 working capital days or two days better sequentially after adjusting for divestitures and purchase accounting adjustments, versus the prior year and our expectations we benefited from accelerating customer collections and ongoing inventory management, while continuing to support our suppliers. Margins in the quarter came in at 18.2% or 150 basis points higher than last year and ahead of our internal views. Most of the expansion or 140 basis points came from the $60 million synergies drop through. We also saw benefits from our cost management efforts and tailwinds from reduced expenses such as for travel and trade shows. Along with operational efficiencies which more than offset 60 basis points of COVID headwind. While some of the expense tailwinds are temporary, our margin performance highlights the portfolio's resiliency during a tough environment and our future earnings potential. Next let's turn to slide 11 for details on the guidance outlook. Organic revenue is unchanged at up 3% to 5% % with top line trending as expected. And overall COVID impacts still sized within our prior range. For our core US government business representing about of 75% sales, we expect the 8% first half growth to carry over to the back half as well. And for our commercial aerospace businesses, which were down about 50% in the quarter, it's generally tracking to our previous forecast for the year and in line with broader industry forecasts. In public safety, the business was down in the mid-teens in the quarter and we now expect that business to decline around 15% from 10% previously, reflecting the slow pace of new awards. On international, we're holding our flattest view for the year based on our second half visibility with upside opportunity in ISR. So overall relatively minor changes with a clear line of sight to our sales outlook, which is supported by a funded book-to-bill of 1.1 in the first half. Shifting the margins. We've increased our outlook to 17.5% plus with the plus indicating potential upside of 10 to 20 basis points versus the prior guidance of 17.5%. Due to performance to date. cost synergies, E3 progress and expense management. Margins step back in the second half versus the second quarter due to higher R&D investment as well as a placeholder for higher COVID related mitigation costs or disruptions, but still continued margin expansion progress on the full year of nearly 100 basis points. On EPS, we're holding the full year guidance range of $11.15 to $11.55 with the contingency at the midpoint from the margin up side to account for the uncertain backdrop amid to pandemic's progression. On capital allocation, we're in a strong cash position and should remain so after completing our committed repurchases with divesture proceeds here in the third quarter. Beyond that we'll continue to monitor market conditions for deployment opportunities such as capital returns and employee pension plan contributions. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion remains intact with similar upward pressure from earnings upside, working capital traction and lighter CapEx. Finally and briefly on the segment outlook. We've maintained our guidance for all line items but for margins at IMS, where we see likely upside. The improvement is coming from synergy drop through and operational excellence via E3 productivity. Both year-to-date and going forward. So a great example of the merger benefits. So to put it all together, a solid growth outlook supported by our year-to-date performance and forward visibility. With an upside bias assuming a stabilizing environment. And with that I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. SethSeifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Bill you talk in the slides about the potential for cash flow growth beyond 2022 and you mentioned your working capital, just wanted to confirm a; is that the chief source of cash flow growth in those out years number one? And b; are there others and if so, kind of what are they? And if you could speak a little bit maybe qualitatively to the magnitude and relative importance of those other drivers? BillBrown: Yes. So Seth thanks for the question. So between now and 2022 time frame mid single digit plus type of revenue growth that we expect because we're seeing good visibility in the 2021 budget, which we think is going to get passed sometime in the next six months or so. Our programs are very well supported there. A lot of unspent dollars from prior years, good opportunities on revenue synergies, growth opportunities international. So we see the top line continue to improve, margins coming up, we're doing very well in margin progression this year. Jay just talked about some of the upside drivers here in calendar 2020 we see continued momentum on margins over the next couple of years. It's certainly not going to end as we get to 2020. There's going to be opportunities even certainly beyond that. Working capital is a driver, we've made great progress down 13 days since the close to 55. We see getting to about 50 days or below 50 by the time we get calendar 2022. But that way we look at this from a bottom up perspective, Harris was at 41. We can see our ability getting down into those 40-41 days. So even as we had 50 days in 2022 an extra 10 beyond that's about $350 million worth of cash, which has great opportunity to deploy it. In the near term certainly next year or so towards share buyback that will reduce our share count. So overall you put all those pieces together, we continue to see double-digit growth in free cash per share. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. RobertStallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. I think it's a question for both Bill and Chris. I mean I'll see a lot of talk out there about what the trajectory of the DoD budget could be over the next few years. But I was wondering if both of you could maybe frame how different the merge company is today versus what you saw in the last defense downturn. And how things could play out? BillBrown: Well, I mean I'll start and I'll let maybe Chris jump in here, Rob. So that's -- it's a great question, look, I think part of the reason why almost two years ago now Chris and I contemplating putting the company together was really to build a more scaled mission solutions, priming Chris talked a lot about becoming a sixth prime. When we sit there in fact when we talked about our merger back in October of 2018, we talked about our presence connecting across all domains a CP or ISR powerhouse company mission solutions prime company. And you can see based on the progression we've seen to-date clearly moving in that direction. Certainly as the DoD moves towards connecting all of their platforms, all sensors, all shooters across all domains. I see us be really being in the sweet spot of that. We've won 7 IDIQs on ABMS. There's a lot of players on the team, but I think it's testament to the capability that this organization has overall in spectrum superiority, spectrum dominance across what we do in electronic warfare, waveforms, communications, ISR, all those pieces come together to help realize that vision of where the DoD needs to move to in order to fight the next fight. You can see really across all domains. The progress in space, the progress in unmanned both airborne and maritime. So we're really I think realizing that vision and I think we're a much more resilient organization today we would have been several years ago with a tremendous opportunity to gain share in a market that may flatten or come down over time. So I think we're just a fundamentally different position today we were a number of years ago. I don't know, if you want to add, Chris. ChrisKubasik: Yes, maybe I'll just add a little bit, Rob. We talked a lot about leveraging the scale of the enterprise and I think in this industry scale matters and you look at this new company with close to $700 million of R&D that positions us well for these new markets and NextGen opportunities. So we're starting with the clean sheet. I believe we're pretty agile and responsive. The national defense strategy talks about disaggregation. Bill mentioned autonomy and some of the capabilities we have there fit nicely with these large platforms and then the ability to connect them. And you look at our ability to attract and hire college grads and others, there's a lot of excitement with this new company. People see that we're growing 8% in the government business and I think we're ahead of schedule and going better than I would have expected after 13-months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. CarterCopeland: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. I hope everybody's well. Bill, I wondered or Chris, I wondered if you might tell us a little bit more about this comments on trimming the IRAD pipeline or narrowing the focus of that IRAD pipeline, just help us think through the price prioritization and that thought process. Are you looking to prioritize capabilities or ROIs or customers, any granularity you can give us on how you're thinking through that process? Thanks. BillBrown: Hey, Carter. It's a great question and it really I'm glad you asked it because I think it's a fundamental part of the value creation story that we have in front of us. We've been talking about this for a couple of years of taking, as Chris just mentioned $700 million worth of IRAD that previously was distributed very deeply and broadly across the company not centrally coordinated, no clear business rationale across the individual investments and through the work that CTO Ross has done here to really get at and categorize where all that money is going. We looked at it; we saw 30% of the projects that were -- didn't have a business case or were overlapping were duplicates. And we've provided two investors some examples of that, so allows us to focus that firepower that's pretty potent on a smaller set of opportunities really around the areas around multi-function, open systems architecture, software-defined everything that really is the heart of what we're trying to do in spectrum superiority, sensing solutions, delivering actionable intelligence. That's where we're really focused and as I think about this that's -- that is going to enable us to continue to invest in these new opportunities that we're seeing coming through in revenue synergies. We've won quite a few here. They're small today in terms of revenue impact. They'll grow over time but the pipeline is large, is getting bigger and really positions us and I think in a fundamentally different way. So when you think about value creation, a potential into the future for a technology company we call L3Harris, this is fundamental to the value creation story. ChrisKubasik: And I'll just chime in Carter, I mean; this is what we've been talking about for almost a year and internally and externally. This is about optimizing the enterprise the greater good of L3Harris versus optimizing the divisions and this is part of the transition from more of a holding company to an operating company. And when we look at things holistically from the top down, we're able to prioritize those to get the greater growth and the greater returns. Same process applies to CapEx and everything else that Bill, Jay and I look at on a regular basis. So that's the origin of the 30% that Bill referenced. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. NoahPoponak: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me, okay? Great. I'd love to get a little more specific on the capital deployment plan and specifically the intent to buy back stock, just given the large cash balance at the end of the quarter and how much free cash you're set to generate moving forward here. And if there's going to be even more proceeds from divestitures. One, will you restart in the third quarter on an underlying basis even before the Leidos proceeds like are we just buying back stock again now or not. And when I add up all those pieces, it looks like you could be buying back several billion dollars a year going forward. Is that a reasonable assumption? BillBrown: Yes. So, Noah, look in Q3, we will use the proceeds we received from the sale of SDS to Leidos, was $1 billion we closed that out in Q2. We'll deploy that back to owners as we've always said we would in Q3 we sold an asset and we're buying back an asset, happy to be our stock. As we look to the back end of the year with a $1.3 billion, 3 billion four-ish in free cash generation in the second half. We'll end the year with a pretty strong balance of cash in the [one seven one eight] kind of $1 billion range. So still opportunities beyond that for deployment as we've been talking a lot we see that growing $3 billion by 2022. There's no debt pay down requirements at all, we'll refinance some debt but at 1.7 going to1.5 leverage ratio. We've got, I think a good leverage basis we don't see any significant M&A on the near term horizon. So it gives a lot of opportunity to deploy that upward to $3 billion a year in free cash generation back to owners as we said we would. And that just to remind everybody is after significant investments in development internally hiring people, training people, spending investment on capital driving IRAD at close to 4% as Chris mentioned a couple of minutes ago significant investments inside the company even with that gives us an opportunity to deploy that cash effectively with shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. GautamKhanna: Thanks. Good morning, guys. How you doing good? Hey, I wanted to ask Bill if you could maybe numerically express the revenue synergy opportunity in some reasonable time frame. So whether it's 2022 and 2023, what should we be anticipating, so what you're going to get incrementally from some of these captures you're pursuing that combine the capabilities of L3 and Harries. And how do you see that playing out over the next 5 or 10 years. Could give a quantification of it? BillBrown: Yes. So again we won 13, it's in the tens of millions of dollars and it's actually growing it's -- we're seeing good traction there. You'll see it a little bit in the 2020 results will start to grow in 2021, little bit beyond that. The pipeline itself is north of $5 billion and it's growing every time we meet with the team. And it's pretty substantial. The opportunities that we want are in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of lifetime revenue. So I would expect I don't commit Chris and Jay to something here, so maybe I'll let Chris jump in here but I would expect that it'll be something growing north of $100 million a year, but Chris maybe you could add. ChrisKubasik: Yes, no. I'll sign up to at least $100 million a year and would you say 10 years from now, no, it's as Bill said it's going better than we expected. And we have a very strict definition of what we're calling revenue synergy. These are bids that neither company would have submitted had we not merged together. So we're getting the momentum, a lot of these are the initial wins some from DARPA, some from rapid capability office and then we got a win from four to two to one but we like the momentum. And I would expect that this will contribute to our top line growth for the foreseeable future. And we'll quantify it for you as we start to move up and get some of these wins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. DougHarned: Good morning. Thank you. If I think back to Chris to what L3 looked like not that long ago and you had all of more than 80 or so businesses with overlapping overhead functions and the sense of need to rationalize the supply chains and facilities. And if we roll forward where does--where do things stand today in terms of addressing a lot of the opportunities and costs that you had before because I'm just -- you continue to find new cost synergy. So I'm trying to figure out what the pathway looks like in terms of the things you've gotten done, the things that are still to go here and where you can potentially be? ChrisKubasik: Yes, no, that's a great question, Doug. And I say we made a really good progress in the last 13 months but a lot of the progress we made was a result of starting early even the pre-merger. I'd say we're ahead of schedule on the synergies that we talked about, but everything that we've looked at shows continued margin upside and cost take off opportunities well beyond the initial three-year period. The facility consolidations are ongoing. Those will take the most time as you would expect. I think we've made great progress on the supply chain and that's just something we're going to continue to work on year after year. And also not only on the value capture but improving the resiliency given some of the recent challenges in the COVID environment. So if this were a baseball game we're probably in the second or third inning as I see it holistically. And really hitting the ground running on day one. The benefits and the HR and all those initiatives were done on the first cycle which was pretty impressive. So I think there's a lot more to go and we see this as part of our culture of operating excellence and it's just going to go year after year and I think there's a lot more to go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. SheilaKahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, everyone and thank you. Bill, I think you mentioned six businesses with high working capital and you quantified the opportunity which is quite big at $500 million, I'm guessing the size of these businesses might be fairly large, but is there anything structurally different about them and how do we think about that working capital drive down contributing to intermediate results? BillBrown: No. There's nothing structurally different about them. They -- what's happening is we're getting into a lot of detail what's driving the working capital to be where it happens to be. And as I mentioned a lot of it is inventory, sometimes inventory is north of 100 days and it's about just prudent management, improving forecasting, improving the performance with suppliers because a lack of confidence in when a supplier is going to deliver a component drives management to increase buffer stock. It's managing better the development of new product so that you're leveraging components that exist across other products. So you reduce sort of both SKUs as well as the parts that go into the SKU. So it's really across all of those fundamental pieces, Chris and I and Jay have a weekly evidence just right next to our integration meeting is the focus on working capital. We've been doing this since day one. We've got dedicated teams focused on this, is driven by the general managers themselves. The teams are incentivized to improve cash. We incentivize and drive working capital. So we expect to make a big achievement in those six businesses but the reality is we have 19 different sectors all of which have opportunities to improve working capital and we're going after every single one of them. That's what gives us confidence of taking the 55 to below 50 and hitting 40 over the next couple of years. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. RichardSafran: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I hope everybody's well. So Bill and Chris, I thought I had another question on your revenue synergies. I thought you might try to explain the driver of the revenue synergies. And if they continue why the potential is north of $5 billion. And why they've come so much earlier than expected? To me Pentagon's giving awards to non-traditional players in major platform markets, you have space with launchers. And you recently with Maritime, so is that the driver here, why you stand to benefit? Is the Pentagon looking for more competitors? And bringing in non-traditional players? And I guess is there room now for moving LHX to the next level as a sixth prime? BillBrown: I think the DoD is looking for more competition, more company suppliers that can bring unique mission solutions that can simplify what they're doing bring additional capabilities it\u2019s driven through technology investment. I think what we've proven is the ability to a; invest the technology dollars. And then find ways of delivering new capability from those investments. So I think that's clearly the direction that the DoD happens to be moving into, but I think we have just a great opportunity across our portfolio. We've had from day one, people getting together in classified spaces and open spaces sharing ideas. And when you have a good sense of what the mission need is, and you put technologists in a room. To try to look at what we can do differently. There are just lots of great opportunities that, that come from the capabilities that being brought by this new entity. So, we're still early days. This is only one year and it's moving faster than we had expected. There's been a lot of resonance with the customer as you could see by the winds we've had so far. We've got to follow through; we've got to win some of the down selects, move some of the studies that Chris mentioned here with DARPA into actual programs of record but that happen over time with continued focus and investment. And if anything that the opportunity said is getting bigger than smaller. A lot of it's coming in the classified side as well. I mean keep in mind too in the classified domain a lot of these things are relatively stovepipe and the larger companies have a broader view across multiple different programs. So what we're now doing is getting more visibility across multiple different types of programs, classified programs and we're bringing different mission solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. GeorgeShapiro: Yes, good morning. This is probably for Jay. I was curious as to how much incremental cash you got from the change in progress payments? I noticed that accounts payable were down $328 million. So, you obviously gave some of that back at the same time receivables, inventories and contract assets were down $447 million. So maybe just expand on that. And then what you would expect it to be for the year and is that a potential increment to the cash flow guidance that you have? Thanks. JayMalave: Okay, George. So I'll just go to the quarter and then the year. In the quarter the progress payment benefits were in the range of $100 million. And that was pretty much flowed down through to the suppliers. Separate from that we did have customer payment accelerations that also we benefited from in the quarter, you're in the range of say $150million or so. The flow through of that to the full year is really dependent on what the customers do. If the customers continue to on that type of prepayment schedule on the non-progress payment type of a payment schedule. Then we would see a potential upside in the year if it's, if not and then they go back we'll probably see a snap back and it really would just be pulling into the second quarter. So, it could be upside, we have to kind of just monitor the customer behavior over the back half for the year as far as these accelerated payments. I mean if the progress payments right now we're expecting those will continue but those could shift as well but as I just mentioned that's been basically flowed down to the suppliers. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. PeterArment: Yes, good morning Bill, Chris, Jay. Bill I want to circle back on the budget kind of topic. We get a lot from investors about maybe L3Harris as exposure to kind of the OEM, O&M side of the budget? And I think it's reasonably high. How should we think about that part of the budget if that, if the overall budget starts to compress how that impacts you? I know there's a lot of ISR missions and activities that flow through there but maybe just some color on how we should think about that? BillBrown: Well, it's sound -- I think we size it in the 40 percentage range of our of our business, it\u2019s O&M funded. I think this year the DoD is under running the spending on O&M, so it does create actually some additional opportunities for O&M dollars and you mentioned exactly right some of that does fund some of the ISR missions that we happen to have here. So we think we're well positioned on that. I don't think it's a major concern as we go into 2021. I don't know Chris or Jay if you have any thought on that but-- ChrisKubasik: I think it's just good diversity and various sources and colors of money. I think is actually strength. So yes I echo what Bill says I think we're in good shape. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. DavidStrauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, I want to follow-up you mentioned E3, if you could maybe talk about what kind of organic margin upside you've seen so far from E3, how much further you think it can go? And then on the synergy side, you said a bunch of times there's upside to $300 million any sort of quantification of how much upside there could be beyond that? Thanks. BillBrown: So David, look, we're making really good progress on E3 in fact at L3, Chris instituted a program called L365. We had our own program here at Harris HBX the combination of that I think has yielded a process internal process that's been driven deep into the organization. We typically would expect something like 2% to 3% net of inflation, net of giving back to the customer as well of costs coming out and we're seeing E3 in that range over the course of the year is getting a little bit better. I think we would sustain that in 2021 and 2022. So it sizes it a bit. As we get beyond the calendar 2022 time period and integration starts to wind down in terms of that focus process the drive to achieving cost savings will continue. It all merges into what we now call E3. So we do expect to hit $300 million net in 2021. We do see opportunities beyond that some of the -- I think that Chris mentioned a minute ago about facility rationalization. They do take a bit longer. They won't be fully completed in 2021. So we'd see a little bit of step up in beyond 2021 on just this consolidation of the facility. So we can't really size it today as we get further down the path, we'll continue to update investors on this, but as you think about where we've been over the last six months we started out the year guiding to about $115 million net. We went to $165 million now we are at $185 million in an environment that's very uncertain with the COVID pandemic. So we continue to make great progress here, great progress on E3 and all of this is going to drive us north of 18% margins next year with some upside beyond that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. PeteSkibitski: Yes. Good morning, guys. Hey just on the really strong second quarter margin rate at IMS was there any one-off benefit in there and it looks like guidance is assuming kind of a lower rate sequentially in the second half of the year. Jay kind of touched on a little bit but any color that you could add there? JayMalave: Sure, Pete. It's really strong synergy drop through over 200 basis points. They do have a benefit of pension running through because that's a predominantly legacy l3 business, but they also had strong productivity E3 productivity dropping through which pretty much offset any mixed headwinds. And a little bit slower on R&D there and as I mentioned we expect R&D to step up in the back half of the year. For the full year, they're just --they're doing well. We originally 13.5%, it does step down as I said for the R&D as well as a little bit of a mix as we induct some aircraft, but bottom line there you're going to see some solid margins around 14.5% for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. MichaelCiarmoli: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to stay on that R&D looking at the second half margins they obviously come down a bit, you talked about that COVID placeholder and I think you called that out maybe as a contingency in the earnings bridge. So maybe that's $10 million or so, but how big -- how do we think about the R&D step up? and I guess I'm thinking about it too in the context you're talking about of 30% IRAD but it sounds like cutting 30% that IRAD but it sounds like some of that's just going to be reinvested. Is that the right way to think about sort of the reprioritizing of the IRAD and kind of funneling it back into higher areas of opportunity? JayMalave: Yes. A lot of the reprioritization occurred as part of our planning process for the year. We're going to step up around 3.5% to about 3.7% in the back half of the year and what we're talking about is as part of the checkpoint process is really just a process for defining prioritizing those projects. There might be some timing differences here and there and we continue to monitor them as part of that process. But there's not been any type of effort to actually reduce R&D spends as we dealt with some of the headwinds with COVID that's really been more other expense type of discretionary spends items that we've been dealing with. And so our goal has been to hold our R&D and protect the investment and for all the items and revenue synergies that the Bill referenced before. ChrisKubasik: I'll just chime in with a 1.19 book-to-bill and IMS specifically. A lot of these as you know start out as more developmental programs and then over the course of the life of the program you get into low rate production and ultimately production of the margins increase. So a little bit of the second half pressure is coming from some of these recent maritime wins which are good margins but dilutive in the near term but we'll ramp up as we continue to deliver on them. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. RobertSpingarn: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wondered if we could disaggregate the space group, space and airborne a little bit just the primes are having such strong growth there. And I'm wondering if you're seeing a higher growth in space than airborne if you could talk about that a little bit. And then if longer term on the space side, you think you can potentially outgrow the market just given the share gain opportunities if you have in front of you. BillBrown: Yes. So, we feel very encouraged by the space business as a whole. Just in the quarter, we had a couple of programs that are transitioning and just the year-over-year comp was particularly difficult in the second quarter last year in 2019 Q2 which as you recall was Q4, the last fiscal quarter of Harris. We had sort of 18%-19% growth in that space segment. So it was quite strong and the comp was kind of difficult just on a year-over-year basis. So, a little bit of impact on just calendarization pretty good book-to-bill in the first half of the year just over one. We were very confident about that business, very strong pipeline of opportunities coming at us in space as we transition from an exquisite provider to end-to-end responsive mission solutions prime, Chris talked about that in his remarks that's both ground -- both space capability and ground support for space capability. The pipeline in those businesses is quite large. It's about $10 billion. We have about a $1 billion of proposals outstanding that are pending awards. So, as we look at this, we expect towards the back end of this year, we'll see some recovery but overall through the technology investments we've had, some of the revenue synergy opportunities that'll come through in the space domain, we feel very good about the opportunities in space. So that space segment also has airborne and airborne has been quite strong for us. That's a lot of the F-35 growth; it's modernization, it's production, it's some sustainment growth there as well. So, we see in our classified part of that space business is growing quite well. So look, we feel very confident about space, it'll come back towards the back end of the year and be a driver getting into 2021. ChrisKubasik: Hey, Robert, I'll just chime in, one of the things that were very exciting about this merger was space and of course pre-merger, you couldn't look at it due to clearances but once we got all the clearances set up. And I got into the program several months back. I got to say I'm even more impressed now than what I thought was suspected that we had. So I think we're in good shape. We just got to continue to win and perform and I think there's some long-term growth here that's going to be pretty impressive. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. MylesWalton: Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to ask other guys in the space and people in the space have size the R&D tax amortization in 2022. I'm curious if you can do the same. And then secondarily on the segments, I know that the pension adjustment being made there was a [$98.9] million in the quarter. Bill, is there any assumption about how much pension helps or hurts that you have to absorb going forward over the next couple of years? And your comment about 18% margin next year and beyond. BillBrown: So, on taxes the impact in 2022 is north of $500 million if the law stays as it is. As you know, others as well as us believe that wasn't necessarily, the intent of the legislation to penalize R&D investment and so that's something obviously we're continuing to work, but just to answer your question specifically. It will be north of $500 million. On pension, if you look at gross pension this year it's about $300 million of benefit; year-over- year it is about $60 million. There's a $100 million in the FAS pension benefit that's offset by about $50 million of lower cash recovery and so net-net you're talking about $50 million - $60 million. Right now, we're not expecting any significant changes in pension benefits next year. If we were to strike it right now would be generally in line with that. I mean a little bit worse obviously on the returns but that gets amortized. So right now we're pretty much holding in line there for what I told you about $300 million FAS and $60 million of cash. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. JonRaviv: Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. So, when you're talking, Bill and Chris, you're talking about transition obviously to an operating company while the industry itself has been in some transition. We know what the NDS wants for capabilities. Can you talk about how it's acquired? How those things are changing like investment requirements, business models, partnerships, leveraging commercial. You've got a big prime out there with new leadership talking about new ways of doing business like 5G, some of it sounds like stuff that you do. So, you can just expand on what the next generation of defense industry you think looks like here? BillBrown: Well, Jon, I'll start and maybe Chris can jump in here. But the way I look at this without commenting on what other players in the space happen to be doing. We're very unique in a sense that we've got this opportunity that can only be created by this significant transformation driven by a merger. It's a seminal event allows us to drive a clean sheet and take a fresh approach about how you drive connectivity, cooperation, collaboration across the enterprise and that's what we talk about when we drive towards an operating company is from a technology perspective making sure all of the pieces are connected across the enterprise. We believe success in the future is going to come from driving our business as operating entities not as disconnected pieces of an [indiscernible] organization like a holding company would have. So, we have an opportunity to drive that as part of the DNA that's being created in the organization that we're building. We're not trying to start from an existing large position, but we've got good momentum that's built here and we feel pretty good about our ability to compete and win based on that particular model. ChrisKubasik: And I'll just say from the customer perspective. And I will throw out the customers have been great here during the pandemic. I mean Bill and I have had unfettered access to them and there's been a lot of creativity accepting a lot of our products using video and virtual means and inspecting the products. But the customer talks a lot about speed and they have rapid capability offices. They're using OTAs as an example. And I think we've been pretty good in responding and quick turns and winning some of these new business opportunities, several of which are revenue synergies. And again I think the mission systems are becoming more and more important and the customers are looking at maybe procuring those directly from companies like us and there are several initiatives in that regard ABMS and others. So, I think we're well positioned and we can adjust to the customer as they change their buying patterns. And if there's new business models, I think we're more than capable to support that so. BillBrown: And certainly there's not -- we're not beholden to a platform. There's not a loss risk -- risk of loss of revenue from moving from proprietary to open systems. We're building the organization from the start with a focus on open systems architecture, which we believe is an opportunity for us and certainly what we're here to do. So, I want to thank everybody for joining the call today. And I'd like to close by again thanking our employees as well as the leadership team for their hard work, for their dedication as we wrap up our first year as L3Harris. And for continuing meeting customer commitments during these very challenging times. So, thank you to everyone and be safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Third Quarter Calendar Year 2020 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, the first half of prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. So two years ago this month, we announced the merger of L3 and Harris. And thanks to the hard work and perseverance of our employees, we've been able to deliver results consistent with or better than expectations, despite market volatility and unforeseen obstacles like COVID. Their efforts have led to another strong quarter and put us in a position to raise our 2020 guidance. The mitigation plans we implemented earlier in the year to manage COVID-19 have proven effective in keeping our employees safe and our facilities open and will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We also continue to support our supply chain through accelerated payments, totaling over $200 million in the quarter and nearly $0.5 billion year-to-date and we expect these advances will continue in the fourth quarter. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.84, up a solid 10%. Company margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% on organic revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $726 million. Our core U.S. and international government businesses were up over 7% including double-digit growth internationally, partially offset by COVID-related impacts on our commercial businesses that were down largely in line with expectations. With another quarter of strong execution on our under our belt, we're improving our outlook for the year and increasing margins, earnings per share and free cash flow to the upper end of the prior range, while narrowing organic revenue growth to the prior midpoint of approximately 4%. It's worth noting that despite the pandemic headwinds, we're back to the midpoint of our initial 2020 earnings per share guide, a testament to the benefits of the merger and our earnings power. Integration activity continued to progress well. And then in the quarter we delivered net cost synergies of $50 million, bringing year-to-date savings to $165 million and well on track to meet our $185 million target this year. At this rate, we'll exit the year with $250 million in net cumulative savings, which positions us to deliver at least $300 million net in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our E3 operational excellence program continues to mature and become institutionalized and alongside cost synergies was a key driver of the 60 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 130 basis points year-to-date. With our strong performance to date, we're increasing our margin guidance to approximately 17.75% for the year, a 100 basis point improvement from 2019 and a solid base to build on over the medium term. As we look beyond 2020, we see three primary building blocks supporting mid-single-digit top line growth. First, we have a portfolio that is well aligned with national security priorities irrespective of the outcome of the elections. Our broad C5ISR capabilities are essential elements encountering the near-peer threats identified in the National Defense Strategy : resilient communications, open architecture command and control, offensive and defensive cyber and ISR across all spectrums electro optical, infrared, hyperspectral, RF, sonar; and all forms of intelligence, signals, comms, electronic and image. We have leadership positions in many of these areas and operate in all domains. And we've realigned our R&D efforts to extend our position through investments in open architecture, multifunction, software-defined technologies. The security threats are real and we anticipate that future defense budgets will continue to prioritize spending in these areas where we're well positioned and we're investing. Second, we uniquely benefit from the revenue synergy opportunities created in a merger of two complementary companies that expanded our addressable market. This quarter we received an additional 12 revenue synergy awards bringing the total down selected proposals to 25 out of 37 for a cumulative value of over $300 million, an initial down payment on our multi-billion dollar pipeline. Two recent wins worth highlighting are the Space Development Agency's tracking layer, which leveraged legacy Harris' strength in space payloads and integration with L3's onboard space avionics solutions. The other is SAFE-SiM, a DARPA program to simulate and train for future multi-domain battle that addresses the challenge of secured data sharing of highly classified sensors. And third, we see upside in international which at about 20% of revenue is underrepresented versus peers. With a now larger international footprint, we can better leverage our scale and extensive sales channels and capitalize on our domestic position to support global modernization efforts and extend our ISR leadership in the airborne, land and maritime domains. And as seen with recent awards this quarter to deliver missionized aircraft to both Canada and the Royal Australian Air Force, we're making progress. Our top-line and margin opportunities along with our discipline around working capital and CapEx support our free cash flow potential as well as our ability to return capital to shareholders. We're off to a good start to-date and now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion for the year at the top end of our prior guidance. This performance coupled with divestiture proceeds has enabled us to return over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the third quarter, which put share repurchases to-date at $1.85 billion ahead of our full year 2020 commitment of $1.7 billion. For the full year, we now expect share repurchases to be about $2.2 billion, a pace we plan to sustain through next year. On portfolio reshaping, we're about one-third of the way through our bottoms-up target of divesting 8% to 10% of revenues and activity continues to be robust. Our criteria and strategy haven't changed as a result of recent events. We continue to be patient and persistent as we look to maximize value. And as previously stated, we will announce divestitures as they occur with proceeds primarily used for capital returns. So overall, we're executing well despite the uncertain times. And with our unique revenue, margin and cash opportunities we remain focused on delivering double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share. So with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss segment results. Chris? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems revenue increased 6.2% primarily from growth in our Maritime business as recently awarded manned and classified programs began to ramp up along with growth from our ISR business driven by strength in aircraft missionization. The modest decline in our Electro Optical business was due to timing of deliveries. Operating income was up 21% and margins expanded 190 basis points to 15.5% from operational excellence and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D investments. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with particular strength in Maritime resulting in a segment funded book-to-bill of 1.08 for the quarter and 1.22 year-to-date. Our Maritime business continued to build out its pipeline of opportunities following the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle award. Additionally, the team finalized its position on the largest -- as the largest subcontractor on the U.S. Navy's frigate program. We're playing a key role as a mission solutions provider for electrical propulsion and navigation systems. The current 10-ship contract could exceed $300 million if all options are exercised. In addition, the Department of Defense recently reported its long-range plan to significantly expand the U.S. Navy's manned and unmanned ship count to over 500 with the greatest increase planned for unmanned vessels. With our experience and capabilities in both platform types, we are well-positioned to support the Navy's growth. Turning to Space and Airborne Systems. Organic revenue increased 6.8%. Growth in our Avionics business was driven by the production and modernization ramp on the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and Cyber. These were somewhat offset by program timing in the Space and Electronic Warfare businesses, which based on recent awards including the F-18 IDECM contract position us for growth in the coming quarters. Segment operating income was flat and margins contracted 110 basis points to 18.5% as integration benefits and operational excellence were more than offset by program mix from recent wins. Overall funded book-to-bill was 1.04 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date with key awards received in our Space, Avionics and Electronic Warfare businesses. As Bill highlighted, our Space business was one of two awardees for a contract with the Space Development Agency to develop and integrate an end-to-end system of four satellites where we are providing both the bus and mission payload validating our space strategy to become a mission solutions prime. This system will provide warning and tracking of advanced threats including hypersonic missiles. The initial satellites will be launched within the next 24 months and support the tracking layer of the DoD's missile defense network in space. Once fully operational, there could be a demand for many more satellites with the value well into the billions leading to the next space-based franchise for our company. We expect to build on these opportunities in the near to medium-term with a space pipeline of over $10 billion in opportunities. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 6.7% for the quarter driven by tactical growth in the mid-teens, which included international growth of about 20%. The Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific provided most of that growth. Both DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from continued modernization demand. This strength was partially offset by our public safety business due to COVID-19, which was down consistent with expectations in the mid-teens. Segment operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 230 basis points to 25% from operational excellence integration benefits and cost management. Funded book-to-bill was about 1.0 for the quarter and 0.94 year-to-date and was particularly strong in tactical communications at over 1.1 for the quarter. This was driven by an initial full-rate production award on the U.S. SOCOM's multichannel manpack program as part of the $255 million sole-sourced IDIQ, an important milestone for this multiyear modernization strategy. We also saw healthy activity on the international front including customers in the Middle East where we continue to build out our installed base and identify new opportunities. Lastly, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 4.1% as the anticipated COVID-19-related impacts in commercial aviation were partially offset by consistent strong performance in Defense Aviation Products, which was up high teens; and Mission Networks, which was up mid-single digits. Operating income was down 19% with most of the decline resulting from divestitures while margins contracted 40 basis points to 13% as integration benefits operational efficiencies and cost management were more than offset by COVID-19 related market headwinds in commercial aviation. Third quarter funded book-to-bill was 0.94, following strong first half orders resulting in a year-to-date funded book-to-bill of 1.08. Award activity was notable on several ground vehicle programs from the DoD and international customers for our power and propulsion systems, which totaled approximately $150 million. In addition, we recently announced that we're a partner with Northrop on the U.S. Air Force's GBSD program for operations and maintenance training systems, highlighting continued progress with next-generation programs and platforms. Now over to Jay, who will discuss the financials in more detail as well as our guidance. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of third quarter results and then shift over to our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was up 4.4% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% as the benefit from synergies more than offset higher R&D investment. Earnings per share grew 10% or $0.26 as shown on slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.24 along with a lower share count for $0.13, which more than offset headwinds from divestitures and pandemic impacted end markets. Free cash flow for the quarter was $726 million and we ended the quarter with 55 working capital days, holding the strong first half improvement of seven days. With year-to-date organic revenue growth just over 4% and margins of 17.9% along with a 5% higher backlog, L3Harris is set up well to close the year. So let's turn to slide 10 to cover our updated outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be approximately up 4% or at the midpoint of our prior range with the top line trending largely as expected. Our core U.S. government businesses continue to perform well, up about 7% year-to-date and driven by DoD tactical radios, maritime, mission avionics and classified growth at intel and cyber, and defense aviation products. On the international side, the business returned to growth in the third quarter up double digits, which sets up for a flattish year or better supported by ISR and international tactical radios. And finally this guidance reflects about a two-point impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic in the range of our initial assessment. Shifting to margins, we've revised our outlook to approximately 17.75%, a 25 basis point increase versus our prior expectation from better cost performance and mitigation of COVID impacts. On EPS we are raising our full year to approximately $11.55 at the top end of our previous range and consistent with the midpoint set at the beginning of the year. As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.20 from the prior midpoint is primarily driven by $0.13 of improvement in operations including our mitigation efforts plus $0.07 between a lower share count and other items. Moving to free cash flow, we now plan to deliver approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion or the upper end of our prior guidance driven by higher net income and CapEx discipline. This keeps us on track to deliver our 2022 free cash flow target of $3 billion and double-digit annual growth on a per-share basis. On capital returns, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter with $1.15 billion of share repurchases and 175 -- $179 million in dividends. Year-to-date, total buybacks were $1.85 billion ahead of our prior target of $1.7 billion for the year. With an elevated cash position and solid cash generation anticipated in the fourth quarter, we now expect share buybacks for the year to be around $2.2 billion. And we expect to continue our shareholder-friendly capital framework into 2021, as we normalize our cash balance generate healthy cash flow and continue shaping our portfolio. Now switching to our segment outlook. In Integrated Mission Systems, we now anticipate revenues up approximately 6% for the year from the prior range of up 5.5% to 7%, driven by growth in ISR and Maritime. Segment margin is now expected to be about 15%, up 150 basis points versus the prior guidance driven by solid program performance and cost management. At Space and Airborne Systems, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of approximately 7% within the previous range of up 6% to 7.5%, as higher F-35 revenues continue to drive Mission Avionics. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at approximately 18.75%. In Communication Systems, organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 4% and within the prior range of up 3.5% to 5%, mainly driven by modernization strength in DoD tactical radios. Segment margins are now expected to be about 24% a 25 basis point increase from our prior guidance, primarily from mix related to our Tactical business and cost management. And lastly, in Aviation Systems, we now anticipate revenues to be down approximately 3% on an organic basis versus our prior range of down 1% to 5% consistent with our prior estimates in the commercial aero business, partially offset by double-digit growth on the defense side from classified and other programs. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at 13.25% reflecting the timely and decisive actions to mitigate commercial aero headwinds. So overall, we delivered solid performance in the quarter and year-to-date and now expect to deliver results consistent with our original EPS and free cash flow guidance set back in February. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly touch on our outlook post 2020. We'll provide 2021 guidance as we typically do with fourth quarter results. Though note we remain confident in our framework of annual double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, as the building blocks remain the same : mid single-digit top line growth, steady to rising margins, working capital and CapEx discipline and returning our free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Mike [ph] Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning everybody. You increased the repurchase effort by $0.5 billion directionally closer to sort of your pre-COVID capital return level of $3.5 billion, but not quite there yet. I'm just curious, is there anything that would hold you back from going that much higher? And then more philosophically, Bill or Chris, as you look at capital returns through dividends and repurchase, do you have more headroom here to maybe push the dividends a little bit harder? And do you think that would be more appealing to investors? Thanks. Bill Brown : So Myles, I'll start on the second one and maybe I'll ask Jay to come back on the first one on the buyback. Look on capital returns, we -- the philosophy really is 100% of our free cash flow coming back to owners in repurchases or dividends and we see that through next year. We've been leaning pretty heavily into share buybacks and Jay will talk in a minute about our philosophy there. Based on our share price, we think that that's a good value. We do see our dividend with some room to move up. We've been up about 25% in our dividend rate since close. We had raised it twice once at close and once at the beginning of this year. But at about 28% of our free cash flow being paid out, it's below the bottom end of our range. And we'll expect to take a hard look at that early next year and probably lean a little bit heavier into our dividend. But broadly, all of our cash will come back to owners plus divestiture proceeds through at least next year. Jay, you want to talk about the buyback? Jay Malave : Sure. Myles in the third quarter, we increased a little bit relative to the proceeds about $150 million. If you just do the math, I would say $350 million here in Q4. You can back into our free cash flow for the fourth quarter. And with the dividends we're approaching kind of the framework that Bill just mentioned as far as returning free cash flow to shareholders. Yes, there could be a little bit more room there. I mean our balance is elevated with $1.3 billion at the end of September. Given where we are with the guidance we just gave you, we would expect the balance to continue to remain elevated in December. And so there could be opportunity there. We're also evaluating other items which could include some pension contributions but -- so we're leaving our optionality open a little bit. But if it doesn't happen in this quarter then it would carry over into next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ms. Kahyaoglu, I'm showing its muted, you're live for question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, sorry about that. Thank you guys for the question and good morning. I wanted to ask about just integration activity. Clearly, it's been performing really well and EBIT was up $32 million in the quarter. But ex-synergies, your incrementals were about flat. And then the implied incremental for 2021, ex-synergies is 20%. So, how are you thinking about maybe incrementals going forward outside of synergies? And what changes with mix going forward? Thank you. Jay Malave : So, Sheila it's a great question. If you think about it maybe in kind of a little bit bigger picture, we end the year this year we'll be at 17.75% for the year around that ballpark. We do have incremental synergies next year $50 million. That equates to anywhere around 25, 30 basis points of expansion. Our core E3 productivity is obviously going to be a driver for us, but we do have some mixed headwinds that we'll be dealing with and we deal with that every year. And so our intent always is to drive more than the mix headwinds. But I think for now right now as we're continuing to go through the planning offsetting one for one is where we stand at the moment. The only thing I'll say is that we will see a little bit of a headwind in Q1 because of the -- just the roll-through of the commercial the pandemic-related impacts roll through the four quarters. And so that will put a little bit of pressure on Q1 which will also have an impact obviously on the full year. But having said that I think mix is something we just have to keep an eye on, but our core E3 productivity is intended to offset that on a kind of run rate basis and drive. Once we get beyond the synergy period in the integration period, our core E3 operating excellence program will continue to be a driver of margins for us. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey good morning everyone. Bill and Chris what drove your narrower 2020 revenue outlook? And I know it's still too early to talk 2021, but how much of your expected 2021 revenue is already in the backlog versus what you need to go out and win? Bill Brown : So, right now as you'll see in the Q, our funded and unfunded backlog at the end of Q3 was about $20 billion. And you'll note there about two-thirds of it 65% rolls out through calendar 2021. So, we think that that part of our business is pretty solid. We've got a very good pipeline $69 billion. It's come up over the last quarter. It's come up about 8% or 10% since the beginning of the year. So, it continues to grow be very robust. And as we look into next year and to Jay's points about mid-single-digit growth we see good solid growth in our core U.S. government businesses. You've heard a couple of our peers talk about low to mid-single-digit growth there. We will add on top of that with revenue synergies that we've talked quite a bit about. We see international growing. It's a growth business for us here in the back half. Book-to-bill was very good. The pipeline is really strong internationally. We see that being a contributor into next year. And certainly as Jay just mentioned about commercial, it will be a little bit of a headwind until we lap one year on COVID. But the other dimensions will be pretty strong going to next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe two areas following up there to talk about growth. One is in space. I know Chris you mentioned a lot of the opportunities there. Is there a point in which we should see the -- maybe the book-to-bill step up even further and the backlog start to grow a little bit more? And then Bill you just mentioned the international opportunities. Are those principally on the tactical radio side, or are they across IMS or avionics or other areas? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Hey good morning Seth. I'll take a first shot at both of those. Yes, so in space, we're going to be seeing the book-to-bill increase. We talked about some of the key wins we had here in the third quarter. We talked about our strategy to be a mission solutions prime and it's really taken traction here. The SDA win was a big one. There are some opportunities coming down the pipe in the fourth quarter. A fair amount of them are in the classified world but you'll be able to see that in the quarters ahead. As Bill said on the international side, we do have a strong pipeline a good book-to-bill. The tactical radios are going to grow. That represents about 20% to 25% of our international revenue. We're really seeing it across the board. The ISR platforms are doing well with the aircraft missionization and of course the Maritime business. So it's pretty well spread out across the portfolio and the domains. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Good morning. Thanks and congrats on the SDA win. Guys I was hoping you could elaborate on the revenue synergy opportunity. The SDA win seems like that was -- that kind of establishes a new franchise for you guys. Are there other kind of new franchise-setting opportunities within that pipeline that you could maybe elaborate on, so we could think about growth beyond 2021 as well? And would you be willing to opine on where you think the topline will shake out in terms of growth rate in '22? Bill Brown : Well, first on '22 it's a little bit further out in the future, but I might -- maybe answer the first part of the question as Chris thinks about if he wants to give any guidance on '22. But we're making really good progress on the revenue synergies. And I think this has been a pleasant surprise to all of us in terms of the pace and magnitude of getting that revenue opportunity. I think, it points to the strategic rationale of the combination and the complementary nature of the technology that we're working on. So again, we're about 80 proposals that have been submitted. It's come up from Q3. We're winning quite a few of them. 25 out of 37 is pretty healthy with $300 million of awards. We talked about a couple of these are some of the -- certainly the SDA win is one of the bigger ones. But generally speaking, they're going to be in the space domain electronic warfare, some in maritime. And there's quite a lot that's happening in the classified domain. As we said over multiple calls, one of the things that was unique here is, as we put our companies together, we got a lot of input and feedback from our classified customers, who really see across our portfolio and across other missions across other companies and really giving us strong guidance as to where there might be opportunities to combine capabilities within L3Harris. And the team has worked very hard to put together some compelling proposals and we continue to win. So, it's modest growth this year. It will start to grow next year and be a good contributor in 2021 and certainly more beyond that. It will grow to hundreds of millions over the next year or two which I think is a very positive sign for not just winning them, but actually seeing them come through in revenue opportunity. So, I'm really, really pleased here Gautam on sort of the revenue synergy. I don't know Chris maybe answer the question on '22 if you want to take a stab at that one. Chris Kubasik : Absolutely. No, I agree with Bill we're really outperforming here on the revenue synergy. And over time and probably by 2022, the business development pursuits and as the business integrates, these things are really going to be merging and part of our overall strategy. So, I'm thinking by the time we get to '22, '23, I'm not sure we're going to be calling these out. What it is going to do is give us higher confidence in our growth rate that we've already talked about. So, I'm looking for good opportunities and year-over-year growth improvement relative to revenue synergies. But over time, it's just going to be merged and part of our normal processes. Bill Brown : And I think Jay's comment about the mid-single-digit framework kind of expand -- spans a bit more than one year. Thank you, Gautam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Bill, I get this question a lot from investors so I thought I'd give it to you. There's this perception that your portfolio is shorter cycle than your peer group. I guess how much of your portfolio do you view as short cycle converting from backlog into sales I guess within 12 to 18 months? And do you view your portfolio as shorter cycle and I guess more at risk than your peer group to lower budgets? Thanks. Bill Brown : So David thanks for the question. Look, as I mentioned earlier about two-thirds of our backlog coming out of Q3 what you'll see in the Q is around 20 -- a little over $20 billion funded and unfunded rolls out over the next year. And what I've seen over time is it's hard to compare our portfolio sort of short long cycle versus peers. But certainly, it has lengthened over the last several years as some of the programs that we worked on specifically in tactical radios have moved from sort of book and ship, a quick turn to replenish spares or radios in Iraq and Afghanistan to now being fundamental long-term programs of record which a lot more -- longer visibility in terms of the buying pattern the spending outlook. So, we certainly see our portfolio being longer term than we were several years ago. And certainly, combining with L3, I think puts us in that position as well. So again, I think our portfolio is very sound. It's robust. We're well positioned to grow into next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Pete Skibitski : Hey good morning guys. Bill, can you maybe talk at a high level about these new concepts as ABMS and JADC2? I think you have some bids in there and they seem pretty well supported in DoD. I just wondered, if you can maybe size the opportunity set for you there. It's still a little nebulous. And maybe talk about timing just maybe level set us on your expectations? Bill Brown : So Pete, it's a very good question. Look, you know what -- and I took some pains in my comments to talk about the broad set of C5ISR capability we've had across the company. And when you break down C5 and ISR into its components and domains different sensing technologies, we've got a very strong position across all of them, all of which are essential in enabling this JADC2 or Joint All-Domain Command and Control vision of the future. We're a strong player there. I think on ABMS we've -- lots of players on the IDIQ, but we are across all seven business areas which is somewhat unique. We had content on Project Convergence which is sort of the Army version of that in partnership with the Air Force. We had a lot of content there and we'll hope to see more as it gets into the next version of it next year. We're very strong in maritime and distributed maritime operations. So we believe this is a strength of ours. We've got very strong capabilities in comms resilient communications which is developing very strong resilient wave forms. L3 was -- had a strength there. We had certainly a strength there, very strong ISR. So to me we're right in the middle of this. And I think it's fundamental that JADC2 or that vision that concept is going to be required in a near-peer competition. It's going to be more about the capabilities on platforms and how they inter-operate as opposed to the platforms themselves. And when I think about this powerhouse that we've created here at L3Harris, Pete I think we're right going to be in the middle of it. It will grow over time. There's funding there and we're confident that's going to be a driver for the company over time. It's hard to size it today, but we believe it's going to be pretty important Pete. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed. Richard Safran : Good morning everybody. How are you doing? Bill Brown : Good morning Richard. Richard Safran : Just a very quick question here on R&D, I wanted to ask you about your opening remarks on research and development. Given the number of wins and the fact that your win rate has been increasing in your remarks, I want to know how you're thinking about R&D longer term, if you think it could be ratcheted back a bit? Do you need to spend more R&D to support the increasing win rate on programs, or are you really just about the right level right now? Bill Brown : Hey Richard thanks for the question. I think you're hitting on a very important topic and that is the power of the IRAD that we spend and the work that's happened over the last five quarters. We're spending in the 3.6% 3.8% of our revenue in that range. We think it's sized well. And I think more importantly what the team has done is worked very hard over the last five quarters to make sure, it's spent on the best highest-value highest-return opportunities and focusing that spear we call IRAD.  We've reduced the number of projects by about 30%. We moved about 10% of the dollars around to really be placed on the technology the areas that we think will have the best returns or aligned to revenue opportunities, revenue synergies. And the second element of it is making -- not just putting the -- making sure we're spending on the right projects, but also doing it efficiently. So we've got good opportunities to drive operational excellence skills into the way we develop products. We're pushing hard on digital engineering on DevOps and a lot of our work is software development. There's lots of ways to improve the effectiveness of our R&D spend. And to me this is going to be a very powerful driver of growth in the future. I don't see it stepping up materially from where we're at. I think it's at a good amount. It will come up with revenue in the terms of a dollar perspective, but I think we're spending a healthy amount on R&D. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. I want to go back really to the budget here. When you look across the portfolio, I'm trying to understand how your businesses are affected by end strength and forward-deployed end strength. And changes really aren't in the plans right now. It's in terms of at least basic number of let's say army troops. But we're about to have an election. So if we were to see military personnel reduced in the coming years how would that affect you? And I'd ask the same thing for changes in forward-deployed troops such as movement in troops out of Afghanistan Iraq or elsewhere. So when you look across the businesses how are you tied to those levels? Bill Brown : So Doug I'll start here maybe going to ask Chris to jump in. I don't think we're going to be much affected by redeployment of overseas troops back onshore. I don't think that's going to be a big driver of growth either a top headwind or a tailwind. On end strength it would come back to things like businesses like night vision goggle or radios where those are distributed out to individual soldiers. But frankly we're on the front end of a modernization ramp, even through the next five years. We're not even 40% through the modernization ramp in -- with radio. So even if end strength comes down as I expect it likely will, I don't think it's going to affect the growth rate in our radio business. I think you are so far underpenetrated with new technology both night vision, as well as radios that we still see good growth opportunities there. So if anything reduced end strength might actually free up some dollars to be put onto modernization investments that really affect a broad part of our business. I don't know if Chris you wanted to add to that? Chris Kubasik : Yes. And if there is a reduction in the forward-deployed troops, I mean you look at the rest of the portfolio Doug and situational awareness is going to be critical. So you look at the ISR assets that we have both in space and air and the need as Bill talked about for the multi-domain comms. It strengthens the rest of the portfolio. So I look at it as kind of a net-net push or maybe a slight positive when you look across all four segments. And the same theory applies internationally. There's just a lot of need for communications and situational awareness. So our ISR capabilities both in space, air, land and maritime are well positioned. Doug Harned : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Noah Poponak : Hey, good morning everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak : Hey, guys. So kind of every quarter since the merger we sort of all get on these earnings calls and question you on the sustainability of your growth rate and ask about short cycle and the O&M exposure. And I think those are sensible questions and you guys provide decent answers to those that have some conservatism, but are mostly qualitative in nature. And after every one of those conversations the stock just de-rates moving sideways, while you're performing well and the numbers are going up. And so, I guess, I wonder how much are you all talking about that internally in terms of a different way to start from scratch and reframe this for investors? I mean, you talk about the handful of franchises you have. The defense budget is broken down into a handful of franchises. Is there a way to sort of while still giving detail like super simplify this so that people can see on a legit three to five-year basis you really can keep growing mid single-digits? Because otherwise it just feels like we're just sort of circling back to the same things every quarter. I don't know. I mean maybe there's no good answer to that and you just have to keep performing and the stock eventually matches to the numbers. But I was pretty curious if you guys talk about that or think about that internally and if you could share any thoughts with us. Bill Brown : Well, yes, go ahead. Jay Malave : Well, no, I think, I'd comment some of the new awards that we talked about. Just I think it demonstrates and is illustrative of our positioning for the modernization trends that we're seeing going forward. And so while people may want to focus on O&M budgets and historical tactical radios, the new awards that we're winning are really positioning us well for the trends that we're seeing in terms of defense priority spending. And so I think you should as Bill mentioned think about our portfolio and our revenue potential more in that broader context. And that's what gives us confidence in our mid single-digit growth over and we're seeing this in our new awards right now. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Bill Brown : Hey, good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard : Bill you've mentioned defense exports a couple of times this morning. And I think earlier this year you were suggesting this area could be a bit slower, but that doesn't seem to have happened. So wondered if you could comment on what changed there. And also looking forward and maybe to follow on Noah's question how big could defense exports be as a percentage of sales going forward? Bill Brown : So, yeah, as we talked earlier this year right after I think it was Q1 maybe Q2 as we looked at the international business we saw it being more flattish for the year. We saw the first half being down a little bit the back half growing and being about flat for the year. Q3 came in strong like we had expected it would a little bit better than we had thought. So it could be up a little bit, so flat to up low single-digits internationally, so a little better than we saw a couple of months ago. International tactical has come in almost exactly as we had expected. You could see the numbers up 21% in the third quarter. We expect the fourth quarter up a similar amount. So we see good recovery in that business. A lot of it is Middle East, Europe, Asia-Pacific mostly Australia and New Zealand. So, there's pretty good growth in tactical. And we've got a nice pipeline of opportunities. I think the number is about $20 billion of international opportunities. The book-to-bill year-to-date is over 1 about 1.06 or so. We see the fourth quarter looking -- shaping up to be pretty sizable in terms of book-to-bill looks pretty good. About $3 billion of those proposals that are out there of our pipeline is in proposal. So it's actually getting to be more nearer term. So it's looking a little bit more encouraging than we thought just a couple of months ago. I think Chris and the team are putting a lot of focus on this. We have resources in place going after 10 focused countries and we're starting to turn the corner. So we're at 20% roughly in terms of our revenue. We expect it's going to grow several points over the next number of years. I don't know Chris if you want to state a goal there but it's going to come up from where we are because it's underrepresented in our portfolio today. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. I think ultimately the next target would be closer to the 25% of revenue over the several years. And what I like about our company is the portfolio and the demand for our products. And when you export there's always a focus on offensive versus defensive products especially as administrations look at approving these exports. And when you look at our ISR capabilities, the maritime capabilities the radio to comms, those are generally easier to export and approve regardless of which administration is running the country. So I think that gives us a lot of confidence. And we've been able to stay in touch with our customers. We have executives forward deployed full time in the focus countries. And all of us have been using new technology to call Zoom and stay in touch with our customers really on a weekly basis, and that's working well. We're negotiating contracts via Zoom and continuing to keep the business running. So, very optimistic on international. Robert Stallard : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yeah. Good morning, Bill. Nice results. Bill, I guess on the working capital you've given us a lot of details. Just kind of a clarification is the seven-day improvement year-to-date the number? And is that a good kind of I guess pacing item as we think about your goal to get to the low 40s as we think about next year and into 2022 to hit that kind of $3 billion free cash flow target? Thanks. Bill Brown : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yeah, so seven days year-to-date it's about 13 days operationally since the close. So we put out our divestitures and purchase accounting. We will see towards the back end of the year. We'll probably stay right on 55 days. So, you won't see seven-days improvement over three quarters as the continued pace into the future. We see the 55 dropping below 50 over the next couple of years three to four days per year. That gets us to the $3 billion goal in calendar 2022. We still see an opportunity to get down to the low 40s or about 40 days. Certainly, that's where legacy Harris was. We've seen our peers at that point. So even after calendar 2022 47, 48 days we see opportunity to continue to prove working capital beyond that. As I said last time and we've talked about this a number of times a lot of it is going to be on inventory. So we've got a lot of opportunity here. We know where it's at. We've got 10 businesses that we're really focused on that drive 75% of our working capital six with more than 75 days. So we know where we're focused. We're driving it hard. We review these every single week. And you can see the progress and trajectory that we happen to be on. So, again, about three to four days a year beyond calendar 2020. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jon Raviv : Good morning. Thank you. I know you talked a lot about margin going above 18% with the synergy drop-through offsetting the mix. I think there's been some conversation over the last month or so about a long-term opportunity for 20% margin. What's your perspective on how you get there? Is it all in your control, or do you need some customer behavior to change? And then also, if we're going to get there is it linear, or could there something \u2013 could something big pop up in a given year such that you have to make a big investment margin could step back for a year or two and then kind of hitting that margin expansion growth trajectory again? So more of a long-term question there around margin? Thank you. Bill Brown : Hey, John, look it's a good question. I mean I think we're really performing better than we had expected on margins even through this year. Keep in mind, we started the year I think guiding to 17% to 17.5%. And now, today it's 17.75%. So in an era of COVID, which actually dinged us about 40 basis points this year, so we're performing very, very well. It comes through the synergy drop-through. It comes through operational excellence, which is maturing at a fast clip. Jay has talked about 18% or so next year. He gave you some of the drivers. Will it go up beyond that? It will likely move up. I don't know if and when it will hit 20%. I think the key thing to be thinking about is we got to make sure that we're leaning in to go after and drive revenue growth capturing some opportunities, which might have a near-term short-term impact on margins, but long term be good businesses for the overall enterprise. We got to make sure we continue to invest at the level required to grow the business on a long-term basis. Anyone could easily pull back investment like IRAD, and drive margin up in the near term, but be detrimental on long-term value for the owners. I think you have to work the pedals here, and I think we do this very, very effectively. So we can't commit to something beyond next year, but we will commit to continue to work the agenda to drive hard on technology investments which drive differentiation and good cost management lean productivity across the whole company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. George Shapiro : Yes. I wanted to know, what's the progress payment benefits you've gotten this year, and then how much benefit from payroll deferral. And is that inhibiting getting to the $3 billion of free cash flow next year? I'm assuming, CapEx probably is no higher next year than what you're saying this year? Thanks. Jay Malave : Sure George. Thanks. The progress payment benefit this year is in the range of say around close to $100 million in that ballpark maybe a little bit lower than that. That one, we basically have offset with small supplier payments. And so it's just one for one as it's come in. We really pushed supplier payments out. On the payroll tax benefit, that's kind of $150 million plus in that ballpark, similar type of effort. We've kind of put a placeholder there to support supply chain there as well. That as you know, will be paid back over two years 2021 and 2022. But I would say, as it relates to kind of longer-term targets and our $3 billion target, there's a number of puts and takes. There's risks and opportunities. We've got that factored in. We feel good about our ability to generate continued working capital improvement and we don't see that getting in the way of us getting to $3 billion in 2022. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ron Epstein : Hey, guys. Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning, Ron. Ron Epstein : Bill, just following up on one of your earlier comments. You gave us some color on the growth in classified. Can you give us more detail on that? And you mentioned that that's a big area for synergies. I mean, -- and then I realize it's classified, right? So it's difficult. But can you give us some more feel around that? And then also how many more opportunities are there out there? Can you share the growth profile? And what percentage of the overall business is classified today? Bill Brown : Okay. So let me hit on a couple of points there, Ron. But you're right a lot of it's classified in terms of its nature. But it's about 20% of our total company revenue is classified. And as you know, the classified budgets both military and national intelligence programs. Those budgets have come up over the last five or six years. They're at a very healthy level. And that does offer some cushion, if you will, as you go into the next several years. If there's more pressure on the non-classified DoD budget, money tends to move and be well supported in the classified domain. And even the elements of that of what's in the classified budget, which is around $85 billion plus or minus between military and national intelligence programs, the elements are actually moving in a direction, which we believe supports a lot of the investments we've made. So, a lot of we focus on is in the space domain, various new technologies for optics RF systems, driving to larger constellations from prototypes running a full end-to-end mission solution. I think what's an interesting element of this is, historically, a lot of the space domain was dominated by the intelligence community. But, because of the lower cost faster time to market, more onboard processing of our small satellites, it's opening up new markets within the DoD. So the addressable base for us is actually expanding, and that's helping us quite a bit. So it's really on the space domain, but there's plenty of other classified opportunities on the land in Maritime domains as well. We've got a strong position really across all of them. So it's hard to shape them, but it gets back to the comment I made on the strength of C5ISR. And a lot of the things that we do in the classified domain leverage off of that, we hone technologies advanced technologies, and then you can leverage that benefit into the non-class environment. And that's been a strategy of the company for a number of years Ron, and I think it's worked pretty well. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Rob Spingarn : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, Bill, just following up on that. It seems like the competitive landscape for some of your work is changing a bit. There are some public companies in government services that are increasingly moving into comms and EW. And then you have some private companies, especially out on the West Coast like Anduril and UAVs and SpaceX and smallsats. And the Air Force is also encouraging new contractor formation, business formation. So, ultimately would you accept the premise the competitive landscape is changing? How do you negotiate this in a potentially flattening budget? And how much will M&A factor in? Bill Brown : Rob, it's a very, very good question. So the landscape is changing. We are seeing greater penetration of some of the Western companies Silicon Valley companies, SpaceX you mentioned. As you know, they were one of the awardees of the SDA tracking layer. We could follow what they've done in commercial launch and with Starlink and other things. So they're playing more. There's a number of other companies. You mentioned a few of them. There are some more typical government contractors who are looking to expand what they do into -- from services to other components. So, the market is moving around and we get it. The way we stay ahead is basically running our strategy, running our game which is really strong investments and performance in R&D and technology moving quickly. There's really nobody that's put up a smallsat with the capability we had and the time frame we've done it just in the last couple of years. And I think that's the way we stay ahead. We continue to drive cost out drive operational excellence, improve quality and meet our program objectives. And I think if we do that and we continue to accelerate the pace at which we can execute on our programs and technologies we're going to stay ahead. I think that's what we need to do. Will M&A play a role in that? Maybe over time. Right now, we're focused on integration our portfolio shaping. But as you go out in time, there could be pieces of other companies or things on the market that could become available to fill a gap in our portfolio. We don't see that today but that's very positive. In fact, it's probably likely it's going to happen over time. But today, we're focused on running our game, and I think that's been an effective strategy. So, Rob thanks for the question. It was very good. I really appreciate that. Bill Brown : Let me just wrap up from here. And I want to thank again the L3Harris team. They've done a fantastic job of staying focused to meeting our customer commitments. They work very, very hard, and that hard work has led to another quarter of very strong results. We're well positioned coming into next -- into the year-end and into the coming years. And I look forward to our next update. Thank you very much everybody for joining us today. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability following the L3Harris merger, prior year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter results, and I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their continued dedication and perseverance through 2020. Despite COVID, we've met customer commitments, advance the integration and deliver bottom-line results ahead of initial expectations all while keeping our workforce safe. We'll continue to follow mitigation plans implemented at the onset of the pandemic and keep them in place until widespread vaccinations have occurred. As a combined company, we're successfully executing the strategy we laid out a year and a half ago to drive shareholder value, and our progress is reflected in our operating results and outlook. First, we delivered solid results in 2020, where we exceeded our initial guidance on margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, offsetting the negative impacts of the pandemic with a solid 7% growth in our core U.S. government business and modest growth on the international side. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% from synergies and operational excellence and drove earnings per share up 13% consistent with our double-digit growth framework. With an eight-day improvement in working capital, we also generated strong free cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion. This along with progress on portfolio shaping enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders and deliver growth and free cash flow per share of over 10%. Second, our guidance for the current year shows continued momentum in the business. With the fiscal 2021 budget now set and broad program support across key areas, we're in a position to deliver mid single-digit organic revenue growth at the midpoint, underpinned by the building blocks we previously described. Our DoD portfolio is well aligned with national security priorities. And while the overall budget is flat, we expect at least low single-digit growth driven by space, maritime, DoD modernization in classified programs. Revenue synergies will contribute about a point of growth with the notable driver being the SDA tracking layer award, as well as continued traction elsewhere with a win rate of about two-thirds of the 40 proposals awarded to-date. On the international front, we expect another \u2013 about another point from mid single-digit growth plus backed by a funded book-to-bill of above 1 in 2020 and a growing pipeline of pursuits. And then finally in our commercial businesses, we foresee a more modest impact of full year results as we lap COVID pressures following the first quarter. We also expect another year margin expansion supported by increased synergies and continued operational excellence, net of dilution from new program starts. We exited the year at $270 million in net cumulative synergy savings, $20 million ahead of our prior estimate. And with more confidence in savings from the supply chain, facility rationalization, shared services and functional efficiencies, we're now increasing our cumulative savings to $320 million to $350 million in 2021, up from a prior estimate of $300 million plus and still a year ahead of schedule. Our free cash flow guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion demonstrates clear progress towards our $3 billion target in 2022 with all cash use for capital returns to support double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth. Yesterday, we announced that our Board approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization alongside a 20% increase in our dividend, the third raise since we closed and bringing us closer to our target of a 30% to 35% payout of free cash flow. And then finally, we continue to position the business for long-term value creation by exiting non-core businesses and focusing our significant R&D investment on more strategic, technology-based business areas. We're now in the latter stages of several portfolio shaping processes, and we'll look to provide updates over the coming months. Our expectation continues to be for divestitures to represent a cumulative 8% to 10% of revenue with about a third completed to-date and all proceeds going towards repurchases. And we'll continue to sustain R&D spending at a peer high of nearly 4% of revenue with a focus on open architecture, multifunction software defined solutions across our broad C5ISR portfolio of capabilities. These technologies are essential to countering near peer threats across all domains and our past investments with a driver behind the recent SDA tracking layer, HBTSS, and next-gen jammer wins. So overall, we're clearly making progress in building a high-performance, technology-focused operating company and positioning L3Harris as a full end-to-end mission solutions prime. And with that, let me turn it over to you, Chris. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contracts for the medium unmanned surface vehicle program and the classified undersea acoustic systems program, which alongside an important win on the U.S. Navy frigate program, affirms our strategy to establish ourselves as both a prime contractor and a systems integrator. This progress was offset by a moderate decline in electro-optical due to program timing and an ISR due to aircraft timing. Our prior guidance assumed a December contract for ISR aircraft from an international customer that was delayed due to the customer's decision to expand the program. We are now awaiting parliamentary approval for that program. For the full year, revenue was up 3.3% from double-digit growth in Maritime and low single-digit growth in ISR. Operating income was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. And margins expanded 100 basis points to 14.3% and 230 basis points to 15.3% for the quarter in year, respectively. Our ISR business made significant progress on its international strategy with a contract to provide missionized ISR aircraft for the Canadian Air Force, capabilities on a Maritime patrol aircraft for a customer in the Asia-Pacific region and the introduction of potted SIGINT capability for unmanned aircraft for deployment in Europe and Asia. We have a strong pipeline as our allies appreciate the need for situational awareness that our systems provide. In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.8% for the quarter from a ramp on the F-35 as we transitioned from development to production on the next-generation mission systems in our Mission Avionics sector and growth in space from new program wins. This growth was partially reduced by low single-digit decline in our Intel and Cyber due to program timing. For the full year, organic revenue increased 5.8% from the F-35 ramp and classified growth in Intel and Cyber. Space and electronic warfare were down due to in-year program transition, but recent wins position space to be a key growth driver for 2021. Operating income was up 13% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the year. And margins expanded 150 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter and 20 basis points to 18.8% for the year. Overall, our space business had a transformative year as we've been awarded contracts within the missile defense area, including the Space Development Agency\u2019s tracking layer, and more recently here in January on the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor program, or HBTSS, culminating multiple years of investment in innovation. On HBTSS, our team will develop a prototype satellite that will demonstrate our capability to detect and track hypersonic weapons in space. The initial launch is targeted for 2023 with an opportunity to build out a constellation thereafter. These competitive wins have potential value of over $5 billion, uniquely positioning L3Harris to play a lead role with multiple agencies and mark the culmination of a successful multi-year repositioning strategy, establishing ourselves as a mission solutions prime with our responsive satellites and within missile defense. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.4% for the quarter, driven by tactical growth of 17%, that included record international sales up over 30% from the the Mid East and Central Asia and continued DoD modernization. This strength was partially offset by anticipated weakness in our public safety business due to the COVID-19 as well as the decline in integrated vision systems from international program timing. Full year revenue was up 4.4% driven by 13% growth in tactical communications, primarily from the ramp in DoD modernization programs, which also benefited Integrated Vision Solutions. As anticipated, we saw solid international growth of 4% in tactical communications with major wins in Australia, Europe and the Mid East. Total Communication Systems orders in Australia exceeded 200 million with contracts for tactical radios and wave forms, supporting crypto modernization requirements and the Land 53 next-gen night vision goggle program. The 17% decline in PSPC was consistent with our expectations and should ease post the first quarter. Operating income was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. And margins expanded 280 basis points to 25.9% and 200 basis points to 24.4% for the quarter and year respectively. Our Broadband business had a major strategic win, with the prime contract award for the U.S. Navy's next generation jammer, low-band program for nearly $500 million. Highlighting our advanced technology and innovative solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate-in, in the future. The program comes with follow-on opportunities in the $4 billion range, demonstrates our standing as a leader in spectrum superiority and electronic warfare for legacy and next-gen platforms. This multi-year pursuit validates our strategy to be a prime and provide leading edge technical solutions to our customers. Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue decreased 11% in the quarter and 3% for the year as expected due to COVID-19 related impacts in the commercial aviation business. Growth with our U.S. government customers remained healthy in defense avionics from a ramp on classified programs and ground vehicle systems, and mission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was down 22% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the year, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses as cost actions and growth in defense aviation and mission networks mitigated our commercial headwinds. Margins were flat at 14.9% in the quarter, full year margins however expanded a 100 basis points to 13.8%. Notable activity in the quarter included $142 million order from the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center to continue the development of the next gen M-Code GPS receivers with inception to-date awards had over $0.5 billion. Over the last few months, we've successfully positioned ourselves for growth with notable awards that represent opportunities in the multi-billion dollar range. These wins provide a long-term visibility and highlight the strength of our portfolio in a range of budget environments and across multiple domains. With a healthy backlog of $22 billion, that's up nearly 80% for the year adjusting for divestitures and a funded book-to-bill of 1.04 we are confident in the sustainability of our growth. As we think about 2021, we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities that are focused on growing the top line, advancing the integration, expanding margins through flawless execution and continuous improvement, reshaping our portfolio and maximizing cash flow to support capital returns. With that I'll hand it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Fourth quarter, organic revenue was flat, largely driven by the effects of the pandemic and aircraft timing. As our core U.S government business was up about 4%, with the international side up modestly. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18.5%, primarily from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management, earnings per share of $11.60 was better than we expected and grew 10% or $0.29 as shown on Slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.47. Along with a lower share comp of $0.15 which more than compensated for the headwinds from divestitures in pandemic impacted end markets For the full year organic revenue was up 3% with our core U.S. government business up 7% and international up a point. Partially offset by the impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guide. With the integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 13% or $1.34, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 4% lower share count, enabling us to deliver on our double-digit growth target. Solid fourth quarter free cash flow of $642 million resulted in the full-year coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. With this cash flow, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock and paid $725 million in dividends. Okay, now switching over to the 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Starting with the top-line, organic revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5% reflecting growth in every segment with a light first quarter as we lap pandemic-related impacts and phase in new programs. On full year EBIT, we expect total company margins to be 18% to 18.5%, a 25 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint, primarily driven by increased cost synergies, operational excellence and pension, net of mix headwinds from space, IMS and tactical radios. This combined with a 4% lower share count will result in 2021 EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13 per share, up double digits at the midpoint versus 2020. On free cash flow, our guide implies nearly $14 per share at the point and clear traction with our growth framework. This reflects a three-day working capital improvement to 51 days, $375 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. Our guidance also reflects approximately $2.3 billion in share repurchases, excluding divestitures as part of our recently approved buyback authorization. And following yesterday's announced dividend increase, this'll be our third hike since the merger, representing a cumulative increase of about 50, reflecting our confidence in continued cash generation. All told, we expect to return $3.1 billion to shareholders this year before accounting for any divestiture proceeds that'll be additive. Switching over to the segments, Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6%. Driven by ISR aircraft missionization demand and maritime from recent wins. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 15.5% at the midpoint as operational excellence, synergy savings and pension benefits are netted by program mix impacts. In Space and Airborne Systems, we expect organic revenue to be up 4% to 6%, driven by traction and space, and continued classified strength in Intel and cyber. Segment operating margin of 18.5% at the midpoint is driven by mixed headwinds from key growth programs that outweigh E3 productivity, pension and integration benefits. Communication systems revenue is expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5%, from continued modernization growth in DoD tactical, as well as international growth integrated vision solutions. Public safety will have a modest headwind in the year, as COVID related impacts lap in the first quarter of 2021, with a recovery later in the year. Segment margins are anticipated to be 24.5% at the midpoint from operational excellence and synergies, partially offset by product mix within tactical radios. And lastly in Aviation Systems, organic revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3%, driven by continued growth in our U.S. government businesses from a ramp on combat propulsion systems and classified programs, which will be moderated by a slight decrease in commercial aerospace for the year. Segment margins of 14% at the midpoint reflect improvement driven by operational excellence, cost management and synergy savings. Okay. Turning to the EPS slide and bridge on Slide 11, expected full-year EPS of $12.80 at the midpoint reflects 10% growth. Of this, operations and synergies will contribute $0.44, along with a lower share count for $0.57. And pension and other items of $0.26, more than offsetting the $0.07 headwind from completed divestitures. All right, so just putting it all together, 2020 performance is demonstrating the resilience of our earnings and cash generating power and our 2021 outlook reflecting further progress against our financial targets, with recurring double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth, driven by rising top line as well as industry leading margins and capital returns. Okay. One last item before getting to your questions, I know there's been interest in a deeper look into our company as well as our growth drivers. So on March 10, we'll start with a virtual business briefing focusing on two of our segments Space and Airborne Systems, and Integrated Mission Systems. That will be followed by a closer look at our other businesses at a later date. Okay. With that operator, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. My apologies. Sheila will continue in just a moment. Please go ahead, Sheila. Your line is open. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bill, Chris, Jay, your EPS guide is up 10% at the midpoint on a 4% revenue increase. And you announced a fairly hefty dividend increase last night of 20%, but your total deployment is up 8% year-over-year. How do you think about growth in cap deployment from here? How does that tie into your medium-term expectations of EPS and free cash flow per share growth? Jay Malave : So Sheila, you see what we saw today, what we announced last night on the dividend is where it's as far as well as including our share repurchase today. This is consistent with the framework we've laid out over the past year and a half, which is returning 100% of free cash flow to share owners. You'll see 3.1 is a little bit in excess of that in 2021, but the framework is intact. It's a framework we expect to continue moving forward. As far as the dividend, may be a little more specific, 20% \u2013 we've had the target as Bill mentioned of 30% to 35% in terms of a cash payout ratio in the dividend, and that's still our target. That's something that we'll look to accelerate or continue accelerating the dividend growth over the next few years to get ourselves in that range. And so I would expect it to be more of the same going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick clarification on a comment you made Chris, and then a question. The contract you mentioned in IMS, the air airplane contracts, is there any ongoing risk there if that doesn't get parliamentary approval or I think you said that was just scope. Just trying to get my arms around that one. Chris Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Carter. No, the program is in the budget and it's just a process to get through the parliament. What happened was the Air Force in this country wanted to add additional scope to the program and we had planned for a December award. But due to the changes to the contract and the ongoing holidays and the usual delays in that time of year, it's moved into 2021. So we're very confident in this award and it\u2019s just a timing flip. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning, Rob. Robert Stallard : It's either for Bill or for Chris. You obviously talked a lot about the defense exports and your ambition to continue to grow this going forward in 2021 and beyond. But we do have a new U.S. administration. They seem to put a few things on hold. Do you see any implications from this freeze for your export sales this year or into next year? Bill Brown : Well, thanks for the question. I do think that we'll see in the Biden administration continued support for exports to our partners or allies. I think that's been clearly signaled. We'll see kind of like with the last administration, some clear support there. You may see some more scrutiny in certain regions like in the Middle East, and you saw an announcement come out just a couple of days ago. Frankly, it wasn't necessarily new news, it was well signaled. It\u2019s sort of a standard practice for the start of a new administration to take a pause on some of these more contentious exports of certain countries; so number one. Two, we're not an arms or weapons provider, so I'm not sure it really affects us very much. But when we look at sales into the region in those two countries, net of backlog is less than 1% of our revenue. So it's relatively small. And then third, it's likely just a matter of timing. We think if there's any impact to us at all, it's a matter of timing and we think that'll all come out within 2021. So we think this all settled down relatively quickly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Good morning. Kristine Liwag : As you continue to shape your portfolio, can you provide us with an update of what you're viewing as core capabilities versus non-core? And whether or not that's changed with the election results? Bill Brown : Well, thanks for the question. No, it's not changing. I mean, this is not really driven by who's in the current administration or what's happening in Congress. It really is driven by those businesses which we think that we can better own and drive value to owners that tend to be ones that are more technology intensive businesses that require investment in IRAD and our 20,000 plus engineers to make them better every day to differentiate versus competitors. Those are the kinds of businesses that we want to be in, and the businesses we're looking to get out are non-core, don't necessarily fit that model. We're making progress. We had a good start to early 2020. COVID sort of slowed us down a little bit. We saw some acceleration in Q4. And then certainly January has been pretty busy. It's not going to be a linear journey on divestitures, but we're patient, we're focused. We do still think it will be 8% to 10% of our revenue. And as I and Jay and others have talked about, we'll deploy proceeds back to owners as soon as we make those announcements and we'll talk to investors as those transactions occur. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions. Gautam Khanna : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Bill Brown : Hey, good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : So one of the questions we frequently get from investors and I wanted you to respond to it is despite all the revenue synergies and the progress you've shown, there's a perception that legacy Harris comm systems business may not fare so well in a flat to down DoD top line environment. And I wondered if you could just kind of speak to that, how you think night vision, tactical comms, et cetera, some of the shorter cycle that might fare over the next couple of years. And if you could provide some metrics around some of the pipeline pursuits that you're pursuing. Thank you. Bill Brown : Yes, sure, Gautam. Look, we're a very different business today than we were seven, eight, nine years ago when a lot of the tac comm business was driven by repairs, resets. It really wasn't focused on a program of record, but that's very different today. So it\u2019s really stepping back. And when we think about our company as a whole, we've got total backlog at the end of last year at about 1.2 times our revenue. So it's a little bit less than what we see with our peers. So we're a shorter cycle if you will, but we're not necessarily short cycle. We've got a piece of the business and you hit some of the key ones that radios, night vision goggles, maybe a couple of other spots that are \u2013 that have backlog less than one times revenue. So for those businesses in particular, most of them are on programs of records today. They're well-supported. They're in the early innings of modernization and we feel very good about that. I'll take tactical radio for a minute on the DoD side. As we know, there's 350,000 to 400,000 radios that will be upgraded. There's about 10% of the way through there. You can see in the budget in 2021 continued to be well-supported in terms of revenue, in terms of budget authority for radio monetizations, and we're in the front end of a long modernization curve on tactical radios. The same thing is on the international side. There's more than a dozen countries on our front end of modernization. A lot of it announced a couple of 100,000 radios, $4 billion worth of pipeline. So, again, we're on the front end of modernization ramp on the international side, which is it tends to follow what happens in the U.S. And then you mentioned night vision goggles. We are on a sole source director requirement for ENVG-B. We delivered about 5,000 goggles to-date. We're on a program of record, which was announced in September, which we're one of the awardees for that, 100,000 plus night vision goggles. So we're 5% of the way through, again, with very clear budget visibility. So when you look at where we're at our modernization and visibility into the budgets, we think the outlook is very, very positive for all of those \u201cshorter cycle businesses\u201d, Gautam. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Hey, good morning, Noah. Noah Poponak : Hey, Jay, just wanted to try to better understand the cash flow progression. In thinking through 2020, there's a few hundred million of adjusted net income growth, which I think gets all the non-cash out. The deck sites eight days of working capital, which using the number you guys used to quote for per day, that's a sizeable increase. I think he had a deferred cash tax. So I'm surprised that that the 2020 final free cash was only up $200 million. Maybe you can help me square up what I'm missing there. And then if you could then just carry into 2021, helping us understand the major moving pieces in the cash flow bridge that are outside of the business guidance you've given. Jay Malave : Sure. Thanks for the question, Noah. Sure. In 2020, at the end of 2020, we accelerated \u2013 we continue to accelerate payments to small suppliers. Total impact, most of which was most suppliers is about 100,000 million of outflow. Say the other piece of it was just a little bit of timing issue between cash taxes. And so there was some timing of cash that was more in 2020 that was paid versus what we'd originally expected that will be a benefit in 2021. So those are the two primary drivers of 2020. In 2021, as I mentioned, we're relying on three days of working capital. We'll also get a benefit from these cash tax a little bit better than we expected. And those are really the two major drivers. And just speaking, going back to working capital, we continue to drive while it's three days our opportunity set is substantially bigger than that. So there's runway beyond 2020, even in \u2013 sorry, 2021, even in 2021, where our projects are by our sectors, by our segments are pretty well-defined particularly in inventory. And we've got a really nice I think a roadmap to deliver 2021 and beyond going forward. And so, these I'd say the moving pieces are not much different from what we've talked about in the past, really focused on working capital to make that not a use of cash and could make it either neutral or a source of cash and dropping through the net income. In 2021, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll get a little bit of a tax benefit, but really kind of set the stage for continued cash flow growth beyond 2021 as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Thanks. Bill, Chris, Jay, Rajeev, good morning. How are you? Bill Brown : Hey, good morning. Richard Safran : So, at IMS, you noted strong Maritime sales in 4Q. You had a ramp in manned and classified programs. You also mentioned it. I believe in your opening remarks about a driver of 2021. So I'm interested in if you could comment a bit more in more detail about sales and margin growth in that business in 2021 and maybe even in longer term. In your answer could you also comment on classified versus unclassified program growth? Bill Brown : So, I'll start that and maybe Chris can jump in on that. Look, Richard, the Maritime business has been a real strong performer for us in 2020. We have a good leadership. There was lots of pieces that were well integrated together. We're not completely through all that, but we're making really good progress. 2020 was a very strong year, was up double digits. The orders were really strong. Book-to-bill came in above 1, factored reasonably above 1, and we see continued growth in calendar 2021. We're calling it mid single-digit range, but lots of good indicators of continued growth there. We just have a very solid position. We do a lot of work on power conversion, power distribution, towed arrays, mass, sonars, crypto, a bunch of different things. And we've got a great position on the unmanned side as well. So it's pretty broad base. It's across both the OEM and service U.S. international, so \u2013 in manned and unmanned. So we liked the position that we happen to have. On the manned side, we've got good content on both Columbia and Virginia. Those programs are well-supported and Chris talked about the future frigate with Fincantieri. We've got a very strong position in content on the future frigate. Those all look really good and well-supported. And on the unmanned side, I think we're on the front end of this. It's not a big part of the business today, but it's growing. We're the only prime of any unmanned maritime vessel here for the U.S. Navy is the MUSV or the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. We're the prime on that. That\u2019s a pretty good contract we're executing on. We've got a study on the LUSV, which is the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel. We're doing mine counter-measure systems. I think we talked about in a press release about a Phase 2 with \u2013 in Europe, with a partner where we're providing substantial content for unmanned manned \u2013 unmanned mind counter countermeasures systems and then all the underwater side. Really can't talk about the \u2013 on the classified business, but we've got a very strong position on undersea classified capabilities as well. So overall a very good business, with the hope and the direction we'd likely see in the budget of more growth focused on the Navy given where the future threats happened to be. I don\u2019t know, Chris, if I missed anything in that. Chris Kubasik : No, I think you got a good summary. I'll also say the future continues to be bright. I mean, we have to execute on all the programs that we just talked about. But just looking ahead to 2021, the Navy is looking at a couple of programs called spectral, spear and spatial, and these are all integrated signal intelligence programs, sensor to shooter, those types of things. They're under an overall umbrella that does maybe referred to as Overwatch. So if you kind of think of that as the Navy's equivalent of the AVMs equivalent. So, we were excited about those opportunities. And as I said in my remarks, both as a system integrator or a prime we're well-positioned. And then of course, internationally, we're getting a lot of interest of supporting OEMs as they take their business abroad. So it's been a good run and the future remains bright for Maritime. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning, David. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Bill and Chris, I guess, when the merger was announced, the management transition I think was Bill, you were going to be CEO for two years, and then Chris was going to take over. And I think that puts us \u2013 that plan in place happening kind of second half of this year. Is that still what we should expect or is there been any sort of a change there? Thanks. Bill Brown : So, David, thank you. No, it's exactly the plan that we're working towards. It's the end of Q2. It's got a date and a time because it's written in a merger agreement and you're working towards that. I think more broadly, let nudges what's in the agreement is, is the partnership that I have with Chris and we're working with Jay, we've got a great leadership team. We're working well together. We're executing well on our strategy. We're aligned on the direction we're taking in the company. And you'll hear and see more of that in the investor briefing we're going to have in March, where Chris will talk a little bit about thoughts on becoming moving more towards emission solutions provider. As you see here, Ed and Sean talking about their businesses as well, but tracking well, performing well, and we're not expecting any sort of strategic redirection ready bump in the performance of the company. Chris Kubasik : And I'll just chime in. I know a lot of people ask is the strategy going to change when you change the leader and that's not the case. So clearly we've been working this together for over two years, there'll be a smooth transition because Bill will remain in the exact chair for an additional year. So I don't see any big surprises coming. We've laid out pretty clearly our focus on the growth and the integration and the margin expansion and the cash flow. So we'll be in good shape. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Thanks. Good morning, Bill, Chris, Jay. Bill or Chris, I guess I just want to talk \u2013 bask about the synergy targets and performance in the quarter was really impressive. You guys beat I think your target for 2020 by 11% and have raised the longer-term target now. Can you just describe a little bit where you're seeing these gains? Is it just across the board from your E3 efforts? Maybe just some color there that'd be helpful. Thanks. Bill Brown : So thanks for the question. No, it's different than E3. E3 is additive to the synergy targets. So now, we had a really good year. The team is performing, very, very well. I talked a little bit about some of the drivers of the outperformance this year and why we took up our number to next year at $320 million to $350 million, which again is well above what we thought we would do in three years. And we are now doing more than that in two. So we're seeing a lot more opportunities in supply chain, we're still working through our facility rationalization, very, very good progress, substantial activities happening over the course of 2021. It has been very, very well and closely managed and monitored. It's going to execute very well. And we're seeing good opportunities are coming through there. Functional efficiencies, shared services, we just keep seeing more and more opportunities to get better. That's the spirit of continuous improvement. That's really, what's behind E3. That's why we think as we wrap up integration at the back end of 2021. And then in 2022, we really talk about it less as integration more as just productivity and operational excellence. We're going to have a good year in 2021, those are the things that drive it, so team is just executing very, very well. Operator : The next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Bill Brown : Good morning. Myles Walton : Two quick ones, maybe on IMS, obviously the sales didn't quite come through on the time you expect it. I'm just curious, Chris, if it's just a slip of timing, why 2021\u2019s growth isn't more significant. It seems like, kind of the $200 million or $150 million slipped would jolt up that growth rate. And then secondarily I think the F-35 in the avionics business in particular is where one of the biggest contributors of 2020 growth. What does that look like in 2021? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Myles. On IMS side I can see where you'd draw that conclusion. We're still looking 4% to 6%, the initial guidance early in the year for IMS. And it really comes down to the number of aircraft that you can induct in the factory in any one year. So, I think of it as maybe some of that 2020 slides to 2021, the latter part of 2021 slides into 2022, if that makes sense. So we're not losing anything. It just kind of slipped out to the right. And then on F-35 and mission avionics, we have multiple systems that we're providing to Lockheed as you well know, especially on the \u2013 what we're calling TR3 the Tech Refresh 3. So we're going through a transition from development to production. We think longer-term there's numerous opportunities for additional content that we could provide, but not withstanding that as the aircrafts ramp up, we get more content per plane and even the potential for sustainment. We see this as a long-term growth driver for years to come, not to mention the international opportunities on top of that. Myles Walton : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jon Raviv : Thanks and good morning. You sort of given the divestitures and also the pandemic impact on commercial in 2020 is a bit of an easy comp into 2021. And then with the commercial in 1Q still being light 2021 is still kind of setting a relatively easy comp as well. So can you talk about just the opportunities for growth rates to actually potentially accelerate beyond 2021, even slightly as you get over the commercial aero comp, these new space activities ramp up, the revenue synergies pick up. And then also within that portfolio, what might be sort of heading in the wrong direction versus what's heading the right direction to sort of maintain at least mid-single digit growth. Bill Brown : So, Jon I think that's a good question. I think you laid out, kind of the response and the question, if you will. So you laid out some of the drivers next year. Yes, we do see \u2013 as I made that in my remarks, DoD in U.S. government low-single digits, we see revenue synergies about a point, we see international mid-single digit plus, some headwinds coming from commercial, but you're exactly right. As you start to get out into 2022 from 2021, we'll see less of it, maybe no commercial headwinds and maybe eventually starts to turn into a tailwind. We see international as a front-end of a build. Again, we're very under penetrated. We have 20% of our revenues in international and Chris laid out a growth target there. We performed very well in the back half of last year. It was up low-to-mid single digits. We had a very good Q3. And we've got some good momentum coming into this year, a very big pipeline, of our $67 billion total company pipeline $16 billion of which is an international. So we've got a lot of opportunities, we're chasing on the international front. And again, we've talked about the revenue synergies, about a point call it $150 million to $200 million net incremental in 2021 from 2020 we're still at the front end of the build. So we have 40 proposals that have been awarded. We won two-thirds of them, but there's 70 that are submitted so another 30 to be awarded or not. There's more that are happening in the future. So we hope to continue to build on that. And we do hope, just given the positioning of ourselves within the DoD budget, then low single digit growth from DoD could actually grow over time, because we're in great places that we are going to continue to get funded, but we're also growing as a mission solutions provider going after a larger addressable market. So, put all those pieces together, that should \u2013 that could drive acceleration beyond 2021. But right now we're laying out the 2021 framework and we are already thinking about mid-single digits beyond that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Okay. Thanks very much, and good morning everyone. Bill Brown : Good morning, Seth. Seth Seifman : I think, Bill, you talked in the past about getting DoD tactical to sort of $1 billion \u2013 over $1 billion of sales in the early 2020 time frame and kind of got right up to that $1 billion level in 2020. And so, I guess is there anything more specific you can say to kind of outline the outlook there over the next couple of years? Bill Brown : So Seth that's a good question, in fact I remember the discussion from a few years ago about getting to $1 billion. And frankly, it happened a little bit sooner than we had even anticipated at that point in time. So we were just a tad under that last year. With our guidance, we'll be at or above \u2013 it will be above $1 billion this year. We're just very well-positioned across the tactical radio business, as you know. We're across all the services, across all the contract vehicles, very strong position and the Marine Corps was a big driver of us in 2020. We're sole-sourced on HF radios. We're sole-sourced there on Manpack. We'll compete on the handheld this year. We're sole-sourced across SOCOM. Army, we compete versus Thales and Collins. But the fact is I think given the momentum that we have here, we see continued share gains within those areas as well within the army. So, I think we're well positioned. The budgets are very supportive. When you look at all tactical radio in total in 2021 over 2020, the budgets themselves are up about 25%. HMS is up 16%, 17%. So there's very good continued budget coverage here. We're starting the year with mid-single-digit growth in DoD. We're coming off a very strong 2020 and an even stronger 2019. So maybe, hopefully, there's some conservatism built into that. But there's some competition happening this year, and we'll keep evaluating and updating investors through the year on just our progress in DoD. But frankly, the team has done a great job in positioning ourselves for success in tactical over a multiyear period. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ron Epstein : Yes. Hi, good morning guys. Bill Brown : Good morning. Ron Epstein : Could you \u2013 with the change in administration, can you talk about \u2013 I mean, every defense company tends to say we're well positioned for the change. And everyone can't possibly be, right? I mean, that's just impossible. Where do you expect to see weaknesses because of the change? Where do you expect to see strength? And then, where are you positioned the best for the change in administration? Bill Brown : So I'll start there. Maybe Jay and Chris can jump in. Look, I think there's going to be continued focus on the space domain, which we have spent a number of years repositioning the company to go after. Last year, it was a softer year. It was a transition year. We had a couple of program transitions. But you see in Q4, we came back very, very strongly. We're up high-single digits. We'll be up high single digits in 2021. We've got good wins. I mean, Chris walked through some of the key ones there. And frankly, that's just going to be continuing to be a growth area. And you heard some of the commentary, from Secretary Austin's commentary at his hearing about the focus on space and it's not just across DoD, there's a lot of classified community investments going on in the space. So I think, number one, we've got a really good position there going from components to systems, and I think a proven strategy. I think some of the things that's happening on the unmanned side are opportunities for the future, both on maritime as well as on the airborne side. We've got really strong positions in both sides. I think that's going to continue to be well-funded. At the end of the day, any fight in the future particularly against these near-peer competitors will require network platforms and not just simply platform improvements themselves, so how they work together. That requires resilient communications. Strong, secure, non-jammable resilient communications, and that is the sweet spot of the company. We keep talking about that. It's very, very important. And there's really no one that's better positioned to enable that JADC2 mission environment than where we happen to be. That's why we're on all of the ABMS contract vehicles, I think we've just had a great position there. That's going to continue to be well supported. So those are the areas that I think are going to be where we're best positioned. And I know what everyone else is talking about. We're sitting here with almost 4% of our revenue in IRAD. We're focusing our company. We've got a very unique situation with this merger where we can start off with a clean sheet and get all of our segments built from the day one to collaborate together, and that's why we're seeing traction here on the revenue synergies. So you put all those pieces together, and that's why I do believe that we've got just a strong powerful portfolio of businesses with good leadership that should outgrow our competitors into the future. Chris Kubasik : And I'll just chime in. Some of the tradeoffs, obviously, are going to be the force structure versus modernization. And then the modernization is it going to be new platforms or upgrading existing platforms and then, there's always the focus on strategic deterrence. So the types of systems and the type of capabilities we have across all domains, I think position us well, there was a question earlier about our content on F-35 as an example, but we're also well positioned on next-generation opportunities. So we can support the upgrades and enhancements to existing systems. I look at what we have in EW. We have five LOAs signed with international countries, for F-16. Modernization is an example. We're on the Columbia class as a strategic deterrent. There's talk about \u2013 next about the nuclear command and control aircraft recapitalization, which again is in our sweet spot. So when you look across the spectrum, space, EW, cyber, ISR, resilient comms, whether we're a prime or a sub, new systems, old systems, I really like where we are. So, thanks for the question, Ron. Operator : Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. George Shapiro : Yes. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, George. George Shapiro : Chris, I just want a little more explanation similar to what you gave Myles on IMS and the SAS sector, because there, you were a little bit short as well in terms of the expectation of 7% growth for the year. You mentioned Intel and Cyber due to program timing, if you could just give some more color on where the shortfall there was. Chris Kubasik : Yes, George, great question, I probably should have elaborated on that. It was really the timing of awards. I mentioned, HBTSS and SDA and some of the classified wins. They took a little longer to get under contract. Or, candidly, some of these were pro-tested and then it caused the delays. So we just saw a slip from the fourth quarter, if you will of 2020 into early 2021. You can't get the contract. You can't get the revenue to get started. So that was just a clear slip from 2020 to 2021 due to timing of those. Intel and Cyber, not too lumpy of a business but nothing to be concerned with there, in fact, when you look at that whole business it\u2019s close to $1 billion, we're seeing growth in 2021 there as well. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. And maybe just back to where Ron was going. A quick one, can you guys \u2013 do you think you can grow the backlog in 2021? And then just looking at that positioning, I think historically, DoD revenues were about 35% tied to O&M exposure. And then, you obviously got some army exposure. But, do you think with the administration change, you're confident in this growth trajectory. Assuming, maybe those prior two would be bill payers? Can you drive enough growth out of maybe air force and space? And maybe even kind of the commercial space to offset some of those O&M and army headwinds if they materialize? Bill Brown : Yes. So, Michael, just very quickly, on Land it's about 20% of our revenue, and it's well supported programs. A lot of its ISR aircraft that we feel very confident it's going to continue. On the service mix, yes, there is going to be kind of a tilt toward sea, air, space center-type platforms in a near-peer competition that's hearing a lot coming out of the navy, and I talked a lot about what's happening with the air force and the space force. So in a flat to declining budget environment, I think there's general speculation, army will be a bill payer here for us. The army is only about 10% of our revenue. It's smaller part of what we do even with the DoD. It's, I think, between the navy and the air force, it's about four times what the army happens to be. So it's not a big part of the company. I think, we are more predisposed to the air force was our biggest customer. And the navy, we spent a lot of time talking about some of the maritime opportunities here. So we think the shift is actually favorable to us. We think we're well-positioned there. And we think we can manage through those shifts happening right now between the services. So we like where we are. We like the positioning of our portfolio. And then, by the way, in 2021, we do think we can build the backlog because we'll see book-to-bill more than one. So, we think that will continue to grow into next year. Bill Brown : So look, that wraps us up here today. Thank you very much. We had a strong solid year. It was a tough backdrop. And I want to thank again our employees for executing well on our strategic priorities, delivering value to our customers and our shareholders, but also providing a solid foundation to build on in 2021 as well as the medium-term. Again, thank you for joining the call this morning. And we look forward to speaking with you more, at our upcoming investor briefing on March 10. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you. Bill Brown : Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics. Organic revenue was up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about 3 points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations. This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic which our team has managed incredibly well and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead. Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9% resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. Free cash flow of $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program with the balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March. Before handing it over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and in L3Harris as CEO. It has been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees, Harris grew from a small niche defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion. I am especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders. The performance culture and the work environment we've created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021, and earlier this year as the world's most admired company. As you know, I'll continue as Exec Chair of the Board for another year working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO. Last week, the independent Directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement indicating their confidence and mind in Chris's ability to lead this company going forward. The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future, and I am excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris's leadership. So with that, Chris let me turn it over to you. Chris Kubasik : Okay, well thank you Bill, and I appreciate your and the Board's vote of confidence and look forward to our continued partnership in your new role. As you've heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us. The strategic priorities we develop together as shown on Slide 3, are the foundations, on which will deliver sustainable topline growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns, all areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter. In terms of the top line, our Q1 results coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22 about 1.5 points versus FY '21 reinforces our optimism for growth. We are encouraged by the continued focus on national security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments. This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains. We are watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies, and international expansion which stem from our R&D investments. In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double-digits driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and tactical radios. Turning to revenue synergies, we received 8 new awards maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million. We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards across all domains that represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. On the Space side, in addition to our recently highlighted HBTSS Responsive Satellite Award with the Missile Defense Agency, our five decades of experience building space-based imaging systems has led to our down select for the initial concept and design of next generation weather imagers. This award supports NOAAs future satellite system recapitalization. The administration's focus on climate initiatives supported by nearly 30% FY '22 budget increase for NOAA, reinforces the opportunity set for L3Harris as we are a leader in weather payload and ground systems, creating an opportunity of $3 billion over the next decade. On the air side, we have strong orders on both new platforms, such as the F-35 and legacy platforms, including the F-18 and F-16. In particular, we leveraged our experience with providing F-16 systems and our expertise in software defined open systems architecture to secure a contract to develop the next-generation electronic warfare suite on international aircraft. We can further expand our global footprint with opportunities in more than a dozen countries, in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This adds to our recent success with the US Navy's next-generation jammer low band award for the EA-18G Growler. We're quickly establishing ourselves as a global leader in electronic warfare and aircraft survivability. We also closed on the ISR aircraft contract with the NATO customer to missionize a series of G550s that was still pending parliamentary approval last quarter, and we continue to work on similar opportunities for other customers, which when combined with the NATO award demonstrates our ability to expand our international footprint and represents over 3 billion of potential value over the next several years. Moving over to the land side, we continue to make progress supporting modernization efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, including a follow-on production order under SOCOM's $255 million multichannel Manpack IDIQ contract. We also received orders for our advanced radio and night vision products from Western Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, further strengthening our international leadership. And finally, in the sea and cyber domains, our maritime team was successful in winning two new prime level programs to provide imaging systems on submarines for international customers. These strategic wins highlight our ability to expand our global maritime solutions to new customers with additional follow-on opportunities to come. And while limited in what we can say, due to its classified nature, our billion dollar Intel & Cyber business received a follow-on order to provide end-to-end mission solutions within its ground-based adjacency franchise as we continue to deliver against our customers' most challenging cyber requirements. These wins provide long-term visibility and support for our funded book-to-bill of 1.10 in the quarter. Our total backlog remains above $21 billion, up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures. In addition, with considerable recent biding proposal activity we're aggressively going after a three-year $125 billion pipeline to deliver sustainable topline growth. Shifting over to margins, this quarter we saw the healthiest results since the merger at nearly 19%, which puts us in a strong position to meet the upper end of our full year guidance. Cost synergies of $33 million, primarily attributable to supply-chain and facilities consolidation, put us well on track to deliver up to $350 million of cumulative net benefits in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our e3 program also gained traction through a strong program performance, factory productivity and supply chain savings. And we continue to believe that there is considerable potential beyond this year to enable another phase of cost opportunities to sustain margin expansion for L3Harris. Lastly, we\u2019re maximizing cash flow through continued working capital and CapEx discipline, driving shareholder friendly capital deployment. And while we\u2019re holding off on updating our $2.3 billion share repurchase target for the year, based on our announced and potential divestitures, we still see considerable up-side to the plan. As an update on portfolio shaping, we\u2019ve recently cleared the U.S. antitrust waiting period on both the previously announced Military Training and Combat Propulsion Systems divestiture and are on track to closing the second half of the year. We\u2019re progressing on other portfolio shaping opportunities and we\u2019ll provide more details over the coming months. And to reiterate, inclusive of divestitures, we remain on track to deliver on our $3 billion free cash flow commitment in 2022 along with double-digit cash growth on a per share basis excluding potential tax policy impacts. So, we\u2019re pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities and progress we\u2019ve made at the start of the year, which gives us confidence to raise the bottom end of our EPS guidance. So, with that, I will hand it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, let me begin with a brief recap of the quarter before I get into segment results. Organic revenue was up about 2% as growth in IMS, SAS and CS was partially offset by the expected decline in AS due to the pandemic. Overall, our core government businesses were up 4.8% reduced by about 3 points of COVID related impacts in our commercial businesses. Margins expanded 140 basis points to 18.9% with expansion in all four segments, primarily from operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management. We did better than expected in the quarter from stronger e3 and cost synergies of roughly 70 basis points as well as some timing benefits from lower R&D and program mix of approximately 50 basis points. This, along with share repurchase activity led to earnings per share growth of 14% or $0.38 to $3.18 as shown on Slide 6. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.34, along with a lower share count, pension and interest totaling $0.23 which offset divested earnings and headwinds, prevent the pandemic impact to end markets. Free cash flow of $630 million was the result of solid net income drop through as well as CapEx and working capital discipline with days roughly steady at 55. And shareholder returns of $909 million were comprised of $700 million in share repurchases and $209 million of dividends. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 5.9% with growth in all three businesses. Double-digit growth in maritime from our ramp unmanned platforms, including the Columbia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate, was complemented by growth in ISR from the NATO award carryover from last year and in electro-optical from deliveries of our WESCAM airborne turrets to the U.S. Army. Operating income was up 19% and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence. Funded book-to-bill was impressive at over a 1.3 in the quarter. In Space & Airborne Systems organic revenue increased 4.1% from responsive programs including SDA tracking and HBTSS, driving high single digit growth in Space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in Mission Avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This strength is partially offset by program timing in electronic warfare. Operating income was up 8.6% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management, including R&D timing, operational excellence, and higher pension income. Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic warfare businesses. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single digit growth in tactical communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization. It also drove integrated Vision Solutions and Global Communication Solutions up double digits. Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments and within public safety due to anticipated COVID related impacts that are now showing signs of stabilization. Operating income was up 12% and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost and management and integration benefits. Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter. Finally, in Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training. High single digit growth in Mission Networks from higher FA volume [ph] paired with fusing and ordinance [ph] growth in defense aviation hope to offset these effects. As we move past the first quarter, we\u2019re anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow. Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% as operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing, and integration benefits more than offset COVID related headwinds. Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter. Okay, let\u2019s shift over to 2021 guidance. We\u2019re off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance and we\u2019re confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our topline growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter. This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full-year EPS guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts. We will provide a more comprehensive update later in the year. In the interim, I\u2019ll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping, and capital returns. On margins, the strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%. We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins. Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance. It will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength. Our portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures, net of buybacks from proceeds. And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divesture process which could have a modest incremental EPS impact for the year. Lastly, as highlighted at our Investor briefing, we have another significant year planned for capital returns. Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion dollars in net divestiture proceeds. So, overall, for 2021 we\u2019re confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share. With that Rob, let\u2019s open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning. Congratulations Bill on building the company you have and Chris of course we look forward to what you have in store for us. I guess, I wanted to focus on two businesses that are doing pretty well are accelerating, so on the international front I think it was up double-digits in the quarter, how are you thinking about the main drivers there going forward? And then maybe more on the domestic side of things, if you could focus in on the Space portion of SAS, you called out growth in programs in Space, but wanted to quantify overall Space and just how do you think about growth drivers there going forward just given wins with STA or HBTSS? Lots in there, sorry. Chris Kubasik : Okay Sheila, thank you very much. Let me start with International. You're right we did have a good quarter with double-digit growth. We had book-to-bill of 1.3. As I mentioned, the aircraft ISR, the Tactical Radios and Maritime were the key drivers. Looking at our pipeline, we have about $35 billion of opportunities over the next three years, so really impressed with the team's work as we position ourselves for future growth. You know it all started with the strategy that we laid out, it's really a two-part strategy, one focusing on the mission systems and the larger programs such as the ISR platforms we have talked about working in tandem with our sales force, which is out there with the products. So, when you look at the Radios, the Night Vision Goggles, the WESCAM, EO/IR turrets, it's a nice complement. So, I think the diversity of our portfolio and the geography with customers in over a 100 countries really positions us well for continued growth. Shifting to the Space question, the Space business is part of SAS. You know I kind of look at it in four buckets. On the low end we have some products, some telemetry and antennas. We do some groundwork, which I think is important to better understand the mission and to support some of these classified constellations. They tend to be mid-single-digit growth, but it's all about the SATs. Historically, we've been on the exquisite satellites as a supplier or a subcontractor. GPS III and classifieds SATs come to mind, but the responsive satellites is really where we've moved the needle last year or so and we're optimistic in the future. So, that's the fastest growing part of the portfolio, double-digits growth for the year. We've talked about the ZEUS program. We talked about SDA Tracking, HBTSS and a fair amount of classified bids that we are working on today. So, hope that gives you a little bit of granularity and insight as to how we are growing Space. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. And best of luck for the future, but it's been quite a ride. Chris Kubasik : Thank you, Rob. Robert Stallard : But my question is quite simple this morning. The Communications margin was very strong in the quarter. I don't think it's a record margin, but certainly feels like it. I was wondering if there was anything unusual that pushed it this high in the first quarter and basically what's going to bring it down into the guidance range for the rest of the year? Chris Kubasik : Sure Rob. There's nothing unusual that was in the results, but a little bit of R&D timing and so we'll see a little bit of pressure there. But the more significant kind of factor that will normalize the margins towards the balance of the year, will really be related to the newer programs. As you know we've got Army HMS programs in the back half of the year. We also have programs like the Next Gen Jammer in the Broadband business and so those will likely put some pressure on the back half of the year on the margins. I'll just, you know, the broader comment I would say is, it's a great start, maybe this is an indication of how to look, think about things perhaps in the future, but we will see a little bit of a normalization here in the subsequent three quarters. Operator : The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Bill, Chris, Jay and Rajeev, good morning. Bill, for what it's worth, I thought you did an absolutely terrific job. So, I wanted to ask about the large pipeline you've been talking about. You've had a very high win rate. I read about new starts like the one with Warren Mattel [ph] and then systems like NOMARS and was wondering how this really large expansion and transformation is going to reshape the company? And thinking longer term, I mean, do you need to increase overhead and your footprint to support new customers? Does CapEx increase to support manufacturing of new platforms? Does the focus of your R&D spend need to shift a bit? And I'm looking at this from a return on invested capital standpoint, trying to find out if the company is sized to support all these new efforts or maybe this is a situation where you're actually doing more with less, expanding operations only with current assets? Chris Kubasik : Okay, thank you for that question, a great, great question and it ties into the strategy that we've talked about. You mentioned NOMARS, which is an interesting opportunity, that's the No Manning Required Ship, a recent DARPA win, which I think is pretty interesting relative to what the Navy is trying to accomplish. Because as you know historically, we've taken manned ships and tried to convert them into unmanned, and this is an early stage design program, where we would be, we are one of three winners if you will. And it's really starting with a clean sheet of paper. How would you design a ship knowing it was going to be unmanned from the beginning? So, on that one it'll be interesting to see how that progresses. The follow-on will be 2022, which will probably be a prototype. And in that case we team with -- we have a variety of teammates and we would probably team with shipbuilders, so we are not going to be investing in a shipyard in that case. I think generally we are pleased with the footprints and the size of our facilities. We talked about space and some of the growth and we took some existing facilities and modified them and re-laid out the footprint to optimize the flow with new tooling and such. So, we spend a $1 billion a year between CapEx and IRAD. CapEx is about 2% of our revenue. I think that will drift down over time. IRAD is industry leading and it is almost 4%. So, the $1 billion I think positions us well. I do not see any increase in overhead or significant CapEx to meet our strategy. And again most of what we're working on are the systems versus the actual platforms, so does not take up as much factory space, if you will. Jay Malave : And Richard, when you think about CapEx for the moment, we -- over this next this year as well as the next few years, we have investments in our IT systems as we're consolidating our platforms. We also have investments as we're moving facilities and consolidating facilities. So, as those trail off that will create capacity to invest in new programs over the next few years. So we don't really see significant new requirements from where we are at the levels today in CapEx. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland : Hey, good morning guys. And Bill, echo all the congratulations on the last several years, it's been an amazing ride. Bill Brown : Hey thanks. Carter Copeland : Just a quick one and then one you might expand on a little bit Chris. Do you guys have any ISR exposure to speak of in Afghanistan that makes for a headwind with the planned withdrawal, just want to cover that base? And then Chris, I wondered if you might expand a little bit on how you think about the capture rates that are embedded kind of in that 3-year pipeline to accomplish your growth goals? I mean, I look at some of the programs you've won and things like HBTSS and Next Gen Jammer Low Band, which may not have been as traditional thought of as things you might go out and win. And it seems like those capture rates have been increasing, but I don't know if you track that or if you can speak to that? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes, thanks Carter. No we do not -- the first question we do not have exposure in ISR in Afghanistan. Total exposure there is in the $10 million range of revenue and a fair amount of that is just ground systems, so not significant. Great question on the pipeline and the capture rates, and I think you're right, I think we've surprised people with some of the wins that we've had, but it really aligns with what we're hearing from our customers and they're change in acquisition process. They really are looking for disruptive and innovative and agile and affordable solutions and that's what we've been providing. We do track our win rates at the company level and you don't necessarily, if they're too high, it suggests that we haven't opened the aperture and been as aggressive as we would like. So, we track those on a segment and an overall basis and 125 billion over three years, if we were successful in at least 50% that easily tracks to a mid-single digit growth targets, and then on top of that we have the revenue synergies that we've talked about. So, we're comfortable with what we've done. We have professionalized the business development function I believe, and we're starting to see the results from that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Epstein : Yes, good morning, guys, thanks. How are you thinking about opportunities in commercial space, I mean the space environment has been, business environment anyway, looks like we're going through a period of change. Are there opportunities for all L3Harris there and how are you thinking about that? Chris Kubasik : Yes, thanks Ron. I think there's been some opportunities in commercial space where some of our payloads, I think we could provide to the primes. As far as us investing in our own constellations or expanding capital is not currently in our strategic plan. Of course, you know we have exposure or capabilities that support the launch vehicles which launch both military and commercial satellites, so we have some opportunities there as well. But as far as being a prime in the commercial space market at this time does not align with our strategic plan. Operator : Next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning and yes, congratulations to Bill and Chris. I just wanted to ask if you could provide some of the disclosure that's typically due around the Tactical Radios in terms of the domestic and international sales and the backlog? And then maybe you mentioned some mix shift there as HMS ramps up. At this point, roughly what portion of the DoD in very rough terms Tactical sales come from Army HMS and kind of how do you expect that to evolve over the next year or two?. Chris Kubasik : Okay Seth, let me first start with some of the accomplishments we've had in Tactical Radios and then I'll hand over the ball to Jay to give you the specific numbers. I mean, we are off to a very good start in 2021 as you saw in the press release. You know on the DoD side, couple of highlights here. The Army HMS Manpack recently completed the IoT in the last year was in the process of going through the DOT&E, Test and Evaluation recently. And the good news is, we just received an RFP for the full rate production. So I think that's a great sign that the modernization is moving forward. In a month or so, the Army should be issuing its HMS Leader Radio RFP, again for full rate production. So, I think that again is an additional positive sign. The Marines recently released an RFP for their Hand Held Radio and the SOCOM business has been growing. We've been meeting milestones. And in my prepared comments I've mentioned an order there for the Multichannel Manpack. So, just gives you some flavors to how the business is doing on the DoD side. Internationally, we have good visibility in Saudi. Last year we booked $174 million order for the Ministry and National Guard, so we'll have that revenue run out through this year and we're working closely with the land forces on the Software Defined [ph] Radio for about 5000 initially, so that's going through the Saudi process. Europe and UK we had good growth. UK the MORPHEUS program is going to replace the BOWMAN radio. So, we are hoping to hear something later this year. So, again I feel pretty confident in what we've done. And Australia, last year we talked about the Delphic Crypto Standard upgrade and new radios for Australia. There's follow-on opportunities there. And of course New Zealand is also a customer that we are working closely with. So, kind of operationally or business development wise I wanted to give you some insight to what's going on and Jay will provide you the numbers you requested. Jay Malave : Sure, Seth. So, I will give you the numbers in the format we've historically provided. Orders were $424 million, sales 474, of the sales DoD was 297, International was 177, and our funded backlog was 958. Related to your question on Army modernization about third of the DoD is Army modernization and you know that will continue to grow particularly as we are going to full rate production on the Army HMS modernization in the back half of this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Thanks, good morning. And good luck Bill in your transition and go Chris and yours. In terms of the F-35 Chris, what better way to bring back old memories and an F-35 question. The hearing was last week. It was brought up Tier 3 and L3Harris potentially being one of the sources of some delays there, could you comment on the progress you're making and the recovery plan there as always seems subcontractor relationship? Chris Kubasik : Absolutely Myles. I'll give you some background, maybe it's going to be longer answer than you'd like, but I think it's important to kind of calibrate everything, and then I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the financial implications. But you're right, I've personally been involved around F-35 for twenty some years as well as many of our senior execs. So, I think that that's an important point and we all absolutely are committed to this platform, which I think is one of the best aircraft in the world. So, L3Harris and legacy companies, we've been a supplier for over twenty years. We have a really good track record. A few months ago we delivered our 2 millionth part and we're like 99.9% on time delivery. So, a lot of the work historically has been with TR2, the Tech Refresh 2, weapons release displays, but your questions specific to TR3, Tech Refresh 3, which is a very complicated developmental program to meet some of the new challenges that our nation faces. So, you're right, we've realized some of the risks, two main drivers, we've realized risk that we had identified and thought could occur when we bid the program. And secondly, as it was referenced in the testimony, there have been numerous government directed changes. So, those are unfortunate, but not unexpected when you're in a developmental program. We are working on three main products, the AMS, the Advanced Memory System, the PCD, which is the Panoramic Cockpit Display and the ICP, which is the Integrated Core Processor. So, we've been stable for the last six months relative to our cost estimates and our schedule. The AMS and PCD hardware are starting qualification and ICP is just behind that. So, when you look at how important the TR3 is, it's a step change in capability. It's half the cost of the TR2 once it gets into production and it's been designed for easier affordability and sustainment. So, we're just about ready to kick off the production phase. I will say that our past financials and our current guidance reflect our performance. We don't anticipate any changes there. And then strategically, these capabilities that we're developing are going to put us in a position to leverage this technology on other products, platforms and future programs. So, we're excited about that, but maybe Jay can comment more specifically on the revenue and the margin implications. Jay Malave : Yes, just going forward maybe over the next few years, our ship set content today is a little bit over $2.5 million around 2.6, with the TR3 production with Lot 15, that will go to around $3 million per ship set. So, as and that again starting Lot 15, as the aircraft volumes start to flatten out we will see growth just through higher content. It's important to keep in mind that as this modernization program there probably will be other modernization programs that will be involved in and of course it will also be part of sustainment program. And so, we see this as continuing to drive growth. I think we'll update it as each year progresses. This year as Chris mentioned is a little bit softer from a growth perspective but we expect that to pick up next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks very much and best of luck Bill. Bill Brown : Thanks Dave. David Strauss : I want to ask a question on the guidance, just so I have it straight. So, the EPS guide as of now doesn't reflect the pending divestitures, but it looks like from the Slide 12 that you think you can offset the dilution through share repurchase [ph]? I guess that's question number one. And then just with the divestitures all coming out of AS, what does that do to the margin profile on a go forward basis for AS? Jay Malave : Okay. David, just to be clear on the 12.85 that does anticipate or include the $0.10 of expected dilution from the announced divestitures, so that's in the 12.85.As far as the announced divestitures' impact going forward on AS margins, it's about 100 basis points dilutive. So, the margins on these two businesses composite a little bit higher than the average going forward. That again changes I guess downstream, we'll see with organic improvements, but just baseline impact of the divestiture is about 100 basis points. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Pleased proceed with your question. Doug hartnett : Good morning. Thank you. Bill, Jay, Chris, I mean, you've seen a lot of companies and I mean, I cannot begin to count the number of situations where management has said, we have a cost reduction program in place. Lay it out. They often have interesting names to them. You all have done the integration. You have the e3 program, and we're really seeing the improvement in margins. But I have to say most of the times you see these cost reduction programs happen and the savings get competed away, mix changes, other costs arise. So when you look forward, can you talk about the things that you're doing and how you can really have confidence that we can see a continued progression of margin improvement? Chris Kubasik : Doug, thank you. First of all, it's Chris. You're right, the integration and the cost synergies, I think, has been a great success. As I mentioned, we're a year ahead of schedule. And it really goes back to after we announced and before we closed, we had a dedicated team, the integration management office that really laid out in detail a plan to go ahead and capture these cost synergies. And that's something that Bill, Jay and I have been meeting and continue to meet every Monday to review the progress. And it takes time, especially something like IT, as we've been consolidating our ERP systems, investing in the infrastructure and going with new applications, relative to it. So that should wrap up by the end of this year and then we'll focus entirely on the e3 process. It's really becoming part of the culture, and we identify projects, we review them on a weekly basis. And these are just lots of singles and doubles, couple $100,000 here, $1 million there. And we go sector-by-sector, segment-by-segment. And world class organizations continually take out 2% to 3% of their costs each and every year over and above the increase in salaries and others. So we're having good momentum. We have good visibility. We came out strong this quarter, if you see it for the year. And my expectation is that we absorbed the headwinds, and we continue to go forward. So I don't know if anyone has anything further. Jay Malave : I'll just say, it's, as you would expect and as you know, it's management attention, both the synergy program, and the e3 Operational Excellence Programs went parallel paths from day one of the merger. We've had separate reviews and go through all of those. And these reviews are monthly. So the management system, we expect to continue that we had started from day one of the merger. And we have monthly reviews with each of our segments as Chris mentioned, we go through the top 10, the top 15 programs and e3 Operational Excellence Program to make sure that they're on track. And so it's simple as management attention, focus, and continuing to drive the operational foundational basics of performing better each and every day. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey, congratulations, Bill and good morning, everyone. Just following up on Doug's question on margin, can you provide a little bit more color on what you know, the e3 top programs are, what initiatives you're pursuing? And also on cost cutting, how do you know you're not cutting too much that it ends up hampering performance in the future? Chris Kubasik : Yes, thanks for the question, Kristine. I'll start and then give it over to Jay to give you the specific numbers. One, line that we're not cutting and I think I've said this back in the March meeting. And again, you look at what we're investing on the front end of the business and R&D and industry leading them out. I said before, we did not cut R&D, we could have cut R&D and increase the margins further, but we aren't. We're taking a long term approach. The investments we have in bid and proposal of which were submitting lots of proposals. The R&D and direct sale expenditures have generally increased as we try to focus on the front end of the business. You know, we talked about the revenue synergies, important part of our success is the workforce and we actually started day one of the merger with negative synergies as we increased the costs and the benefits to make sure our workforce was fully engaged and supported. So that's, that the headwinds and the items I look at to give me confidence that again, we're not looking at this short term, quite the contrary, we're looking longer term. And we're taking an enterprise wide approach. So we talked about shared services as an example, there's lots of companies out there that had individual segments or sectors, doing their own processing, whether it's payables or payrolls. Some of this stuff isn't overly exciting, but going to a shared service concept, having single process, single systems, and optimizing for the benefit of the enterprise versus individual divisions, sectors or segments is I think part of the strategy. And a lot of people say it, it's not easy to do, and we're doing it, so whether it's procurement, whether it's quality, e3 shared services, all those things we're looking at, at an enterprise level, taking out the inefficiencies. And there's more work to do in the years ahead and that's what gives us confidence. But Jay, do you want to maybe give more detail? Jay Malave : Yes, as far as specific initiatives, things that you've heard of in the past, whether it should cost value engineering, supply chain, shop productivity, just a specific example, in our ISR businesses, in terms of people, as you would expect, would be all over an aircraft tear down and build and rebuild. Simple things like changing the tooling, so that you get a benefit in ergonomics, as well as a hours reduction or minutes reduction in the rebuild of a particular aircraft. And so, we've been able to take tooling, in some cases, it's customer funded tooling. On top of it we're able to change our processes, improve them and take costs out at the same time. So it's not a we'll just slash costs, and hopefully it sticks. These are more systemic type reductions that we have an organization built around to drive continuous improvement in sustainable reductions. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning, Bill, Chris, Jay and congratulations Bill, best of luck. Hey Chris, on the Space & Airborne the margin performance continues to be really impressive. And I was thinking just about regarding your cost reimbursable mix has continued to grow quite a bit there. I think it was up 30% year-over-year. How do we think about kind of sustaining these margins with the mix shift that's happening there? Is there still a lot of e3 efforts going on pr or maybe just any color there? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes, thanks, Peter. Now we apply e3 not only to the fixed price contracts, but the cost plus. When we talk about the portfolio that we've built, and how we're positioned in all these domains, a lot of these programs that start out is cost plus or developmental have a long life, sometimes decades, right. So they move into full rate production and then of course, fair amount have potential for international export. So we look at it as a portfolio and then the natural, healthy growing business, you are going to have the headwind mix from the development programs, which will take every day of the week, but the rest of the portfolio is continuing to mature through its cycle. And as I mentioned, F-35 is a good example. We're getting through the TR3, and then we'll be starting in our production. And that program should have a lot of legs as an example. EW is part of SAS, now we've had good success of light, as I mentioned with the F-16 as a specific example. We have legacy programs on the F-18. We don\u2019t talk a whole lot about the cyber business, but that's growing. And again, there's a commercial model aspect to our cyber business that allows us to have licensing and other opportunities to grow margins. So that's pretty much how I look at it. And again, we continue to have confidence, even with the cost plus piece of the portfolio. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys, this is Dan on Gautam. Thanks for the question. So this question, this is actually already asked for, for CS. But I was hoping because, margins were pretty much stronger across the board, but guidance was held. And so I was hoping maybe you could expand on why, particularly IMS and SAS what kind of tempers that performance throughout the remainder of the year to come back into the guidance range? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Sure. So in SAS in particular, we expect in their case R&D to tick up in the back half of the year and so that's one. And then as well as just programs growth on some of these new wins is going to drive margins down just on the lower initial margins I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So for us those are just two factors, pick up in R&D and then a pick up in the lower margin new programs. Jay Malave : Now, that Dan is still early in the year and in my comments, I suggested this because it's high confidence to be at the higher end of the range, so we'll keep it updated and let you know if changes are warranted later in the year. Bill Brown : And it's similar with IMS as well, again for them, it's program timing, particularly in the maritime business. They've been a lot of new wins in that sector. Chris mentioned, we had mentioned before, things like the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. Also the other programs that they've won is just going to drive a little bit lower margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up those particular programs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Jonathan Raviv : Hey good morning, everyone and of course, congratulations to all, specially Bill and Chris. A slightly more myopic version of Doug's question and Christine's question, a question from Dan. When you think about this year's margin, you're talking about the upper end of the guidance range for this year. So that's at a base off at which we can continue to expand or should we take this year as rapid improvement, as comprising maybe a couple years of expansion, such that '22 could perhaps be flattish. For example, you've mentioned several times, Jay, that you have some new programs ramping up as the year progresses, is that going to maybe hold down some of the expansion opportunity next year? Jay Malave : Yes, so a little early to talk about our guidance for margins next year, but I will say that our goal each year is to continue to drive the margins up. You know, we've talked about a smaller ramp in expansion, but our goal always is that the e3 productivity Operational Excellence Program exceeds the headwinds from mix and that's what we will strive for each and every year. It's going to vary from year-to-year. So as we get into more specifics, as we put together our plan for next year, we'll be able to obviously give you more detail there. But the way you should think about it on average each year is continued drive up. It will slow from what we've seen in the last few years, but our expectation is to continue to grow. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Noah Poponak : Hi, good morning, everybody and Bill, congratulations on your time and success with the company and thanks for working with us. It was really a pleasure to work with you. Bill Brown : Thank you, Noah. Noah Poponak : And Chris, all the best going forward and look forward to working with you as well. Chris Kubasik : Thank you, as do I. Noah Poponak : Could you guys update us on the programs that had slipped last quarter that you identified? There was the ISR aircraft program that you discussed? And then I think there might have been a few other smaller ones? Did those land in 1Q or not and if they didn't, when do they? And with the ISR1, my understanding was the delay was caused actually by being sized up, but that you hadn't put all of that into the guide. If you could just update us on how you're handling that in the outlook. Chris Kubasik : Yes, Noah, all those items that didn't quite cross the goal line in December were in fact booked in Q1. So the guide represents those programs that have been booked, the results are in the quarter and for the year. So we're very optimistic. I mean, the ISR business, when you take this NATO customer, plus what we've done in Australia, and here in the U.S. with the C3D [ph] program, there's still lots of legs in aircraft ISR. So everything is contained in the latest guide. And as I mentioned, there's several billion dollars of opportunity over the next couple of years as we continue to execute on these programs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro research. Please proceed with your question. George Shapiro : Good morning and again, congratulations to Bill and good luck to you, Chris. Chris Kubasik : Thank you. George Shapiro : These questions are a couple questions for Jay. You spelled out pension income as a benefit in Space, but not the other sectors. I would think other than Aviation it is pretty symmetrical. If you could just spell out how much of a contribution it was as well? And then, if you could just provide how much were public safety and commercial revenues down, and how did they, how were they on a sequential basis and what's the kind of rough numbers that we're at today? Thanks. Jay Malave : Sure. George. So for pension, you're right. It was largest at SAS, but there were benefits across the portfolio. IMS benefited about 30 basis points. CS was very small about 10 and AS about 20 basis points from pension. Overall for the company about 30 basis points and all in. As far as the commercial businesses, PSPC was down low 20's and the Commercial Aviation was down a little bit below 50% in the quarter. So combined you're talking in the 30's sequentially. Commercial Aviation was slightly down from the fourth quarter, and PSPC is the same, slightly down. Some of that though is seasonality. It's not, I don't think the compares that great on a sequential basis it is better I think year-over-year. Fourth quarter I think is seasonally higher in both businesses. Chris Kubasik : I'll just chime in George. Relative to PSPC, and I'm sure you've seeing the $1.9 billion COVID bill has about $360 billion for state and local municipalities. And the states have full discretion on how to spend that money. So I think that's going to give us more confidence in the PSPC recovery, most of which is with states and local municipalities. So I'm sure they're going to be trying to figure out between education, healthcare and public safety, how to spend that money. But I think just in the first quarter we tripled the number of proposals that we submitted. So I have confidence in the second half of the year we will start to see the recovery that Jay mentioned and I think we're all familiar with what's going on in Commercial Aviation, so again that's back end loaded as well. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions and congrats Bill and Chris. Maybe just going back a little bit to Ron's Space question, and kind of tying in where Peter and Jon were going on margins. At the business update kind of presentation last month, you kind of talked about within space and within the segment there around this sort of factory business model with these newer constellations laying out a path towards I guess, four times as many deliveries. How do we think about the move in that production and the higher volumes and presumably some of the leverage you'd get on better throughput, better purchasing? Is that going to be a big source of margin expansion outside of e3? It seems like you're taking on a much different production philosophy there. Chris Kubasik : Yes Michael, well said. I think absolutely, that's going to be a contributor to our margins and coupled with volumes. So we talk a lot about the HPTSS SDA. We wonder down select, we're still in a competition, we're going to go ahead and focus on delivering those aircraft on time and getting them launched. And then, that's where the real opportunity kicks in, whether they keep two suppliers or go down to one. There's literally 10s if not more of satellites for decades to come. So the volume will also play into that and part of the e3 methodology and the focus on operational excellence is really taking Space and making it more of a factory type concept and mindset and we have those capabilities. We do it in other parts of the company, and we're sharing those best practices. So, each and every one of those will contribute. So, thank you for that final, final question, Michael. And let me just wrap it up. I think you've heard throughout the day here that we've had a solid start to the year with exceptional execution and healthy string of awards. Obviously, that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of our 48,000 employees. So clearly, I appreciate everything they're doing. I'm excited about the rest of the year, as we finally hopefully put the pandemic related impacts behind us. We enter the final stages of integration, and we make more progress as a unique non-traditional defense tech company. But before concluding, I also have to thank Bill for his leadership and contribution to the company and congratulate him on a great run. So Bill, I've enjoyed working alongside you the last two years. I'm proud of what we've created together here with L3Harris and more to go. So, thank you. Bill Brown : Likewise, thank you, Chris. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies, Second Quarter Calendar Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP comparable measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that Chris, I'll turn it over to you. Chris Kubasik : Well, thank you Rajeev and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company. We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenges such as the pandemic. The high performance culture and leadership team we've created are set to carry this momentum forward, which is reflected in today's results. We reported a strong second quarter, organic revenue was up over 6% with growth across our key end markets and all four business segments. Funded book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date. Margins increased to 18.6% resulting in EPS of $3.26, up 15%. We had solid free cash flow of $685 million, which contributed to shareholder returns above $1 billion, including repurchases of $850 million in the quarter and over $1.5 billion year-to-date. Our first half performance coupled with our expectations for continued execution in the back half more than offset the divestiture headwinds and supports another raise to our EPS guidance which Jay will cover.  Execution against our strategic priorities that are on slide three continue to deliver results and create value for the company's stakeholders as we make progress and build momentum with top line opportunities, operational performance, announcing and closing divestitures and delivering on our capital return commitments. In terms of the top line, we are at our best quarter since the start of the pandemic, with progress against our key end market growth objectives while seeing data points that validate our focused R&D strategy. Our government businesses were up 6% in the second quarter, driven by double digit growth internationally.  Our international revenue benefited from increased aircraft ISR and radio sales to regions in the Asia Pacific and Europe. And on the domestic front, the growth was broad based with our responsive space and maritime programs, as well as land modernization for night vision and SATCOM products leading the way.  Our strategy to deliver end-to-end mission solutions utilizing the capabilities and scale across the broader organization continues to gain momentum. Our space business strategy is working as we grew 10% in the quarter, capturing classified awards totaling over $300 million for ground and responsive satellite solutions. These awards are also part of the revenue synergy capture efforts and bring awards to-date to over $700 million on a win rate of 70% from our growing $7 billion plus pipeline.  Turning to our commercial aerospace and public safety businesses, they were up over 5% in aggregate, and were led by our commercial aerospace business, up double digits off a low base, and from strength in product sales. On the public safety side, there was a modest decline, but with sequential improvement and increased bid in proposal activity from a more stable backdrop.  Our solid top line was accompanied by backlog growth, as we continue to win strategic programs that includes several pride roles. Backlog increased 7% organically year-over-year to over $20 billion with notable award activity across all domains.  On the space side our revenue synergy awards came from combining electronics and optics capabilities across the company to deliver solutions for an increasingly contested environment. These are incremental to the pathfinder finder programs we previously won, which have billions of dollars of potential over time. Customers are viewing L3Harris as a trusted disrupter. They see us as a company that understands the complexity of the mission and can offer fresh and creative solutions. With a three year space pipeline of nearly $20 billion, there is more opportunity for continued growth.  Within the air domain, we strengthened our existing F-35 franchise with initial production awards for the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit under the TR3 program. This brings total orders year-to-date on the platform to about $500 million. We're progressing on all three TR3 systems through integration and qualification this year and in support of the planned of Lot 15 cut-in of the production hardware. We have also secured a roughly $100 million IDIQ with SOCOM for infrared EO Sensors on Rotary platforms, furthering our modernization opportunities across L3Harris. Moving over to the land side, we signed several key contracts that touched both international and domestic markets. First, we received a $3.3 billion five year IDIQ for foreign military sales, to a range of partner countries from our new broader portfolio of products, including radios and SATCOM terminals. This replaces our prior 5 year $1.7 billion contract, which supports and validates the continued modernization across geographies and expands our product scope.  Second, in the UK we received a logistics support contract covering Legacy Bowman and future MORPHEUS radios, positioning us well for $1 billion modernization opportunity in that country. And third, we won a competitive 10 year IDIQ to supply the U.S. Air Force with our T7 Multi Mission Robots, further expanding our customer reach. After launching the T7 with the UK a few years back, we are now pursuing other international opportunities in the robotic area.  Within the sea domain, our team was successful in extending its leading prime position in undersea sensor systems and warfare training for a range of the U.S. Navy platforms and support of distributed maritime operations. This Undersea Warfare training range program called USWTR has an award value of nearly $400 million and further builds our credibility to pursue additional domestic and international opportunities. In the cyber domain, while limiting to what we can say due to the classified nature, our $1 billion Intel and Cyber business received over 250 million in orders for complex mission solutions and specialized communications for both domestic and international markets, leading to another quarter of book-to-bill above 1.0 for this business. We also had a key award in an adjacent market with our public safety business, with a 15 year $450 million contract from the state of Florida to upgrade and continue operating its law enforcement system for first responders.  Moving over to the budgets, while the process is ongoing, and we await to file up [ph] we were pleased with the initial request for the FY 22 budget as a support stability in the DoD, NASA and FAA spending and is aligned with our capabilities and investment priorities. For the DoD, it's focused on continuing to revolve around and address near peer threats, through high value technology which Congress is revealing, and when we look at the portfolio and the relevant line items, our programs are well supported.  This builds on the trend we've seen in international markets, where there's a broad stability in military spending, including key countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan amongst others. We are also seeing growing demand for the type of defensive systems we offer for our alignment with the U.S. Export policies to ensure partner security.  Our most significant opportunities remain for ISR aircraft missionization and other upgrades, land force modernization and enhanced Maritime Systems. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to outgrow the budget and deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion to drive a large pipeline of opportunities underpinned by our leading R&D investments.  Shifting to operational performance, we continue to surpass milestones for priority programs. For example, at SAS the team completed a successful preliminary design review for an advanced EW solution called Viper Shield that can deliver self-protection capability for Block 70 F-16.  At IMS we advanced our unmanned Maritime Strategy with several customer engagements and demonstrations, highlighting differentiators and predictive autonomy on USVs, as well as a submerged torpedo tube launch and recovery for our small UUVs. We also successfully completed a prototype demonstration for a SOCOM Multirole aircraft in a variety of challenging conditions, while utilizing the breadth of L3 Harris offerings.  And financially, we had another quarter of strong margins as the team continues to offset mixed impacts from early stage programs with three e3 initiatives, including program excellence and factory productivity, allowing us to flow through cost synergies totaling an incremental $27 million in the quarter.  In addition, the first half synergy run rate is now $350 million, driven by progress on facilities, consolidation and IT efficiencies. We see this as the minimum level we'll deliver on this year, up from the $320 million to $350 million range we discussed in April and still a year ahead of schedule. Any the upside from here will be incorporated in our e3 programs, with our integration efforts blending into operational excellence initiatives. Our margins for the year, this leaves us at about 18.5% for the top hand of the prior guide and a level we\u2019ll look to build on in the years ahead.  Next, on capital allocation, today we announced the sale of two small businesses within our Aviation Systems segment for $185 million in cash, and these should close before year end. When combined with the roughly $2.5 billion divested under our portfolio shaping initiative, total gross proceeds are set to be $2.7 billion. We have now divested nearly 10% of our revenues and with the completion of a few others in process, our portfolio shaping program announced in 2019 is largely complete.  Proceeds from divestitures including those from the recently completed military training and combat propulsion businesses will be part of our capital returns program, consistent with our shareholder friendly capital allocation approach. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.4 billion this year, up versus our prior guide of $2.3 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.2 billion in 2021.  So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, confident in our ability to consistently deliver double digit EPS and double digit free cash flow per share growth, and I'm excited about the next phase for L3Harris. With that, I'll hand it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, I'll provide more color on the quarter. I'll cover also the segment results and finish with our updated outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, organic revenue was up 6.2% with a return to growth in all four segments. IMS led the way up 12%, followed by a return to growth at AS of 4.7%. Margins expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%, primarily from e3 productivity, program performance and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D. The sequential decline in margin was also due to timing of R&D as expected.  These drivers, along with our share repurchases led to EPS being up 15% up $0.43 to $3.26 as shown on slide five. Of this growth, volume, synergies and operations contributed $0.18; a lower share count contributed another $0.18 and pension tax and interest accounted for the remaining $0.07. Free cash flow was $685 million, while working capital days stood at 57 due to receivables timing. And shareholder returns of over $1 billion were comprised of $850 million in share repurchases, and $207 million in dividends. Of note, our last 12 months of share repurchases have totaled over $3 billion at an average price of $195 per share, well below our current share price.  Now, turning to the quarterly segment results on slide six. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 12%, led by double digit growth in ISR aircraft missionization on a recently awarded NATO program. In addition to mid-single digit growth in maritime from a ramp on key platforms, including the Virginia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate.  This more than offset the low single digit decline in our Electro Optical business that was due to the timing of WESCAM turret deliveries, which we expect to increase in the back half. Operating income was up 2%, while margins contracted 150 basis points to 15.3%, reflecting expected mixed impacts, including a ramp on growth platforms and programs. Funded book-to-bill was 0.81 in the quarter and 1.06 for the first half with strength across the segment.  In Space & Airborne, organic revenue increased 3.2% from our missile defense and other responsive programs, driving 10% growth in space, along with mid-single digit classified growth in Intel and cyber. This strength outweighed the impact from modernization program transitions in our airborne businesses. We have 35 Tech Refresh 3 program within eight Mission Avionics and F-16 Viper Shield Advanced Electronic Warfare System.  Operating income was up 7.7% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7% as operational excellence, including program performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments, and funded book-to-bill was over one for both the quarter and first half, driven by space.  Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.2% with mid-single digit growth in Tactical Communications, that included international up double digits, driven primarily by modernization demand from Asia Pacific and Europe, and an anticipated decline in DoD from last year's second quarter, 40% plus growth.  U.S. DoD modernization continued to benefit the integrated vision in global communication businesses leading to high single digit and double digit growth respectively. Conversely, broadband was down low single digits on lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments as expected. And public safety was down 7% from residual pandemic related impacts.  Operating income was up 8.3% and margins expanded 170 basis points to 25.5% from higher volume, operational excellence, and integration benefits, and funded book-to-bill in the quarter and first half grew by 1.3 and 1.1 respectively.  Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 4.7%, driven primarily by our commercial aerospace business that was up 20% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. We also saw a mid-single digit growth in defense aviation from a ramp on fusing inordinance programs and in mission networks from higher FAA volume.  Operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.5% from operational excellence, integration benefits and higher volume. Funded book-to-bill was about 0.9 for the quarter and first half.  Okay, shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Overall, organic revenue growth is unchanged at 3% to 5% with our top line trending as expected at 4% for the first half and supported by a 1.05 funded book-to-bill year-to-date. Our U.S. Government businesses are expected to accelerate in the back half driven by Space, Tactical Communications, Integrated Vision Solutions and Classified Growth within Intel and Cyber and Defense Aviation.  On the international side we continue to expect mid-single digit plus growth for the year, as a strong first half, led by aircraft ISR and international Tactical Radios moderates. And lastly, the encouraging results in our commercial businesses in the second quarter build confidence in a flattish outlook for the year with double digit growth in the back half.  Consistent with our overall guide at the consolidated level, we also maintained our segment sales guide as well. And as we think about the second half of the year, our key watch items will be the timing of awards, the continued performance of our supply chain, and the pace of the commercial recovery.  Turning to margins, we have raised our outlook to approximately 18.5%, a 25 basis point increase to the top end of the previous range due to our strong performance to-date and confidence in our ability to execute on cost synergies, e3 and program deliverables. We do continue to expect margins to have moved lower in the back half due to higher R&D investment and stronger growth on new, earlier stage programs.  From a segment perspective, we are holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board, but we're expecting IMS and SAS to be at the upper end of their ranges given their strong performance to-date and are holding AS and CS steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at AS and expected mix pressure at CS.  On EPS, we're raising our full year guide to a range of $12.80 to $13, with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11% growth from 2020, delivering on our double digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures. As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and 0.19% from a lower share count at 203 million shares, along with a lower tax rate of about 16%, all of which more than offset divested earnings of $0.31. On a standalone basis we expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures.  Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion is intact, despite divestiture related headwinds of roughly $80 million and continues to reflect the three day working capital improvement from year-end to around 49 to 50 days, that\u2019s now adjusted for divestitures. CapEx is expected to be about $365 million, $10 million lower versus the prior guide due to completed divestitures.  Our guidance also now reflects approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $1.1 billion from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. All told, we expect to return about $4.2 billion to shareholders this year. So let me sum it all up. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and first half, solid revenue and book-to-bill growth. Further expansion of industry leading margins and consistent cash generation and deployment, all enabling another guide raise as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and drive double digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.  With that Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : I wanted to understand a little more about the outlook for Communication Systems. I mean you already had strong growing positions on Radio Monetization and Night Vision, and then you got some big awards in Q2 and those should add to growth and I would expect this should be high margin as well. And so, when you look at the longer term growth here, look at the revenue trajectory over the next three to five years, how do you see that now? And is there potential to take margins up above their current 25% levels here? Chris Kubasik : Yes Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question, and yes, you absolutely got it right. We've been quite successful in the Communication Segment of late with some of those wins not only here domestically but internationally as well. So I think what we're seeing is some upward pressure for revenue growth and margins over the longer term, like we've talked about before. We had a great quarter when you looked at the book-to-bill, and the continuation for modernization of the land force is, whether it's the radios, the night vision goggles, SATCOM we're really in a good, position. So maybe I'll throw it over to Jay to give you a little more color. Jay Malave : Sure. Just a \u2013 maybe just another quick comment on revenue growth over the medium term, Doug. If you recall and if you look at the future, it's somewhat similar to what we have this year. If you look at our segments, we had SAS at four to six, IMS at four to six and now it\u2019s followed by CS and AS. If you look to the future, we would expect those two segments to continue to be leaders in growth. I will say as Chris mentioned, if this gives us more confidence in the CS outlook, we probably expect those two to drive a little higher growth than CS in the medium term.  On the margin profile, see, this year we are taking \u2013 from the first half we are going back a little bit and that's really a reflection of the mix on the new programs. We have the army, the HMS Monetization programs, we also have in our broadband communication, the Next Gen Jammer Program, so that\u2019s some pretty sizable programs that are actually margin dilutive. The good thing about that is the CMS track record being able to take cost out, drive the margins better over time. So if you look at the first half that shows you what the potential of the segment could be, and so when we end the year this year we'll be in that say 24% -- right now we're saying 24.5% at the midpoint. We delivered over 25% in the first half of the year, that gives you kind of a view of what the medium term could look like over time. Chris Kubasik : And I'll just chime in there. Yesterday we signed a contract with the Mid-East country for the first phase of a multi-year Next Gen STR standardization program, and this has the potential for up to $1 billion over the next several years, so a lot of good positive momentum. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey! Good morning, guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Kristine Liwag : Chris, in Space, can you provide more color on the competitive landscape, the available programs for bid and how you're performing? Chris Kubasik : Oh absolutely! Now we've had a good run in space and as I mentioned, you know we had a good quarter book-to-bill in space was 1.2 so far this year and we've been successful in winning 10 of 18 prime positions just in the last 18 months. So that's something that we're quite proud of and we've also moved into the missile defense arena. So, maybe a little longer answer. The approach we're taking in space is similar to what we've done in all five domains, and it's really understanding the customers\u2019 mission. We have 47,000 employees and 20,000 engineers and 20,000 employees with clearances.  So we are looking at our capabilities, we're looking at how we are spending our IRAD and we are trying to develop solutions and alternatives that meet their needs. We've talked a lot in the past as you know about our responsive SATs, where we were able to develop and launch satellites within twenty months. So that's helping us win a lot of these prime positions. We understand the mission, we have innovative solutions. The focus is on the payload and the integration and speed. So strategically, I think that has been a needle mover. When I look at the exquisite satellites, you know we continue to have some of the best payloads out there, so we're working with partners, usually the larger prime and that's contributed to some success and we have some awards coming up in the next few months that are classified. And then we're working collaboratively with some of these new entrants, just like we do with the traditional primes and find where we can partner, where we can compete, and it seems to be working. So very proud of that team and the outlook is quite positive in space and the budget is clearly supporting this growth as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Hi! Thanks, good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. David Strauss : Chris, I just wanted to ask about the margin side. You're hinting at the idea for further margin upside from here. Can you just talk about the different drivers you see? How much of the margin upside that you see from here is dependent on volume versus kind of what's under your own control from an e3 perspective? And then also what you're assuming for pension when you say higher margins from there guidance? Chris Kubasik : Well, thanks David. I mean a small part of the margin improvement does come from volume and you know we've talked about organic growth trajectory, so that's a contributor. But the big driver is ultimately e3, and we talked about the synergies which are a year ahead of schedule and we're committed to a $350 million run rate.  A lot of this takes more than just the two or three years that we've talked about, and each and every function is developed and executing a transformation plan. It takes investments sometimes in systems and processes, but we believe there's continual upside. We've proven it, we're focused on this, something Jay and I review on a regular basis. So we see no reason why the e3 program can't continue. I'll let Jay jump in on the pension assumptions, but again, the execution has been what's helpful and driving the margins. We're able to control our EACs and the commitments that we sign up to with our customers.  So Jay, a little more color. Jay Malave : Yes, sure. Just to confirm right on the margins, the absorption is a little benefit. That's typically factored in when we talk about the mix headwinds and that\u2019s usually coming in these new programs with thinner margins.  As Chris mentioned, e3 is the key driver. It\u2019s going to drive us and talked about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the medium term of being able to continue to drive expansion and we feel pretty confident in that.  The pension, if you think about this year, all-in between FAS and CAS is benefited of about $470 million on an absolute basis. We expect that next year the CAS element to decline a little bit as a result to the ARPU legislation, it was an enacted earlier in the year. As that pushed out funding requirements for pension our recovery for CAS will come down a little bit, but that should be offset by some FAS income. So net-net I would expect the year-over-year pension to be pretty much flat. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Chris, this is probably one for you. You mentioned that the disposal process is now pretty much done. I was wondering how the prices on the assets that you sold have compared versus your expectations, and do we now see maybe a shift in strategy and perhaps start to look again at acquisitions? Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Well, thank you for the question. Now we've had numerous transactions that comprise the $2.7 billion. You know I went back and looked at our original estimates and we've generally answered your question and have been able to meet or in some cases slightly exceed what we had projected. You know we talked way back about maybe about $2.8 billion of gross proceeds from all these divestitures where 2.7 and as I mentioned a couple of small ones. So we'll clearly get within the range of our expectations.  You know on the M&A front, we did come out of the box two years ago and said we really were going to stand down on M&A and focus on the integration and the divestitures, and as I've highlighted that's gone very well or maybe even better than expected. But even during that two year period we watched the market. I'm highly confident we didn't miss anything in the two year period. So we'll continue to survey the market where we're looking at anything that is \u201ca must have\u201d as we call it.  You know when I look at the portfolio, as we said over the two years, we're in all five domains. I don't really see any glaring needs or gaps. So we'll either proactively approach companies or respond to inbound calls, but we're really going to continue to hold the discipline, look at things strategically, look at them operationally, make sure the financial hurdles make sense. So not really in a rush and very pleased with what we've been able to win organically. So, hopefully that that gives you some insight Robert and we'll let you know as things progress. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the second half implied to sit down in SAS margins. I think you talked in the past about R&D and mix, maybe just quantify those. And also Chris or Jay, could you just update us on Next Generation Jammer? I know the second protest has been you know \u2013 or is being adjudicated I guess by GAO and I guess that's due for a decision here in the next couple of weeks. Would that have a swing factor on this year's top line or guidance in anyway? Chris Kubasik : Yes, I'll take the Next Gen Jammer one first of then ask Jay to chime in on SAS. No, you're right. It's going to be mid-August when we hear the results. We're very supportive and confident and in the process that the U.S. Navy ran and we're assuming that we began work in August and that's built within the model and the guidance. So no additional upside from that, but a huge win and we're looking forward to getting started and delivering those capabilities. Jay Malave : And on the SAS margins Myles, you know this make about \u2013 the first half, about 19.5% in that ballpark. The back half of the year does step down to 18%, maybe 18% plus in the guidance range at the high end of 18.75%. The key driver is really mixed on the new programs, particularly in Space. We've got to step up on these missile defense programs. There's a number of other classified programs that we've already won and that you know we anticipate winning here in the back half of the year, which will continue to put some pressure on the margins in the back half. But again, those are things that we had contemplated coming into the year when we set the guide originally and we're pretty impressed by the fact we're able to go to the high end of the guide now based on these same new programs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Hey, good morning everybody. How are you? A - Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Fine! How are you doing? Richard Safran : Great! You know the international market for defense is always dynamic and I thought I'd follow-up on some of your opening remarks here. Could you give us an update in the overall international outlook, the opportunity set where you're seeing demand coming from and for what types of systems, you know, etc. Can you answer, Chris, you have this reputation with being able to drive and improve relationships with government customers, and I was just wondering in your answer, if you could discuss where you see the opportunities for L3Harris. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions there. I'll go backwards. Yeah, I mean I try to encourage my team that we got to spend time with our customers and listen to their challenges and such. So, actually this evening I'll be headed to DC and have three days of meetings in the Pentagon with a whole variety of customers from OSD and the single services and obviously bring in the key P&L leaders with me. So we like to listen to our customers and see how we can help them and work collaboratively with them on the budget process and such, so. I think everybody does it, but that's something I'm focused on.  International, you know we came out of the shoot and said, this was one of the areas we thought we could do better and I think we said we were underperforming as a combined company, and we were probably right around 19% of our revenue, maybe 20% on a pro form basis back in 29 \u2013 or 2019. So far this year we're at about 22% of our revenue coming from international. So we're seeing a little positive movement. As you it\u2019s a little lumpy.  You know as I mentioned, you know maybe somewhat surprising, the budgets have really been stable across the globe consistent with the U.S. So I think that was a pleasant surprise given the threat environment and you think of U.K., Australia, Japan, Canada and so our approach and strategy that I've talked about is really two-fold. We have the ten focus countries where we have executives, either local country national or ex-pats there day-to-day, understanding the process, the threats and bringing in our P&L leaders, at least when the border is opened to try to close on deals. So that seems to be working well and then more on the traditional product side, you know we use the distributors and the reps and we've been able to use previous relationships to expand the portfolio. You know I mentioned that IDIQ for FMS you know as an example. That now allows all the products of the new company to come through, not just the traditional radio. So, I think that's a positive.  You know a lot of what we do is focused on more defensive systems we're hearing from our international customers, because ultimately they want situational awareness and the ability to communicate in a contested environment. So you know I look at our portfolio and the things we're doing on ISR aircraft, whether it's something like a rivet joint to a business jet, and in some cases to a single prop aircraft.  We have a broad portfolio that allows them to get situational awareness. We've talked quite about \u2013 a bit about our resilient comps capability, our Waveforms library, which is second to none and you know relative to the regions it\u2019s the usual place, the Mid East, the Far East and Asia Pacific and we're seeing growth opportunities in all those areas.  So that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but we're optimistic and I think we're in a good position and executing on the strategy we laid out two years ago. Jay Malave : And just to quickly add to that Richard, you know our growth framework we had laid out a target of mid-single digit plus growth over the medium term for international, so we are comfortable with that. Obviously we're going to be doing that this year if not a little bit better. And as kind of what Chris said, some of these capabilities, the ISR aircraft missionization, if you recall back in our March investor briefing, we've talked about taking the exquisite Rivet Joint capability. Bringing that to business chat is also bringing it to pod capability based on customer affordability, and there\u2019s a significant amount of demand around the world for that.  You look at Tactical Communications, we see a lot of these foreign countries following the same DoD modernization path and so we see opportunities there. And I'd say the other areas is maritime, both in manned and unmanned, you know request for support in the capabilities we would provide, both in say electrical distribution and power control, as well as things like autonomy. So we just continue to see a growing pipeline and we're pretty comfortable with that growth objective over the medium term. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I wanted to ask just a follow-up to an earlier question on RF tactical and sort of the prospects for growth in \u201822 and beyond. Maybe if you could frame for us the international and domestic pipeline and then what did you expect kind of rates of growth to be beyond this year? And then I have a follow-up on IVAS. If you can talk about what your view of that program is as a potential threat or opportunity for the legacy addition? Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Let me do high level on the first question and Jay can give you some more color on Tac Com and then I'll come back and answer the IVAS question.  So specifically domestically we've talked about some upcoming awards that should be occurring here domestically, the HMS Manpack, HMS Leader, those are coming forward here, hopefully in the third quarter. You know in the fourth quarter the marines have a handheld competition that we're also looking forward to getting to results.  Then of course internationally we have a pretty good increase here later in the year and again, the focus there is going to be in Europe, the Mid East and Asia, the Asia Pacific region. Again, we've had good success in the Mid East that I just mentioned from yesterday, some Australian orders and really a pretty strong pipeline. But I\u2019ll let Jay give you a little more color in numbers as it relates to Tac Com. Jay Malave : Yeah Gautam, you know I think overall probably in both cases, both DoD and international you're looking at probably low to mid-single digit growth over the medium term. Part of the reason particularly in DoD is that while we have strong growth on the modernization programs, it does cannibalize a piece of our base business and so you have a little bit of a reduction there with growth, solid growth on the monetization programs, Army being the largest program, that's really in the early innings and we've got the start of full rate production here coming in the back half of this year. Internationally Chris mentioned that before, there\u2019s just demand around the world for some significant upgrades as far as modernization, but again I would put the growth rate right now in that low to mid-single digit as new countries come on, other countries fall off and so you know obviously we\u2019re going to drive that to more of a mid-single digit, but for now I think it's the best way to think about and look at it. Chris Kubasik : Going back to IVAS, you know I think when you look at our ENVG-B program and IVAS, I would say that you're kind of going head-to-head and maybe battling a little bit for budget money although both were funded and you know our focus is clearly to deliver, which our team has done a great job on schedule and meet all of our commitments. I think ultimately its going to be a question of how these get split. I think there's several hundred thousand devices needed and they have slightly different capabilities and mission sets. So I would think over time there's going to be a split between the two. You know we've been talking a little more publicly about some of the augmented reality capabilities within the ENVG-B, you know the real focus on the night vision capabilities. So different capabilities, different mission and you know I would think the two converge at some point and we'll see how the army wants to play that out. But right now we're just focused on delivering and making sure we meet our commitments. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hey! Good morning guys, thank you for the time. On IMS, maybe can you talk about some of that deceleration you're seeing, you're forecasting 5% growth for the year, and you got 9% robust growth in the first half and it implies flat for the second half, so what are some of the puts and takes? A - Chris Kubasik : Yes Sheila, what's happening with IMS in the back half of the year is we had strong growth in the ISR business, which was mostly these international customers. That will moderate and abate a little bit here in the second half of the year, and so the growth rate is just going to normalize back to what we are expecting really for the full year, that's really the key driver, really strong international in the first half that moderates really in the second half for the business back to a normal rate. A - Jay Malave : Yeah, I think of all of our segment Sheila, this one you know is a little more lumpy based on the large significant procurements of aircraft or deliveries and so you kind of get these up and down quarters, but I'd much rather be coming out of the chute strong than having a fourth quarter hockey stick. So you know that's what happens in IMS, mainly in the ISR sector. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Rob Spingarn : Hi! Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Rob Spingarn : You know Chris, it's kind of funny how things change because now we're actually reading about commercial pilot shortages and I think Jay talked about recovering training sales, but I'm curious if you can quantify how big the increase was, either year-over-year or sequentially and what the latest overall recovery expectation is and whether or not this business is core or non-core. Thanks. A - Chris Kubasik : Right Rob, great questions. We did see some good recovery, double digit in the second quarter driven a little more by the products and the actual training. I think there's a slight lag there. You know we have a variety of training models from academies you know where the cadets actually come into our facilities for an 18, 12 to 18 month period. That's been a little challenged due to some of the border closures, so that's a little lagging. I think as the borders open up we'll see an uptick there, of course the delta viruses is coming through on a curved ball in everything compared to what we thought it would be, so the recovery is lagging a little bit. You know the simulators, as you said there's a pilot shortage. People either need to get the training refreshed or a lot of pilots may have retired and there's now going to be some new pilots that are going to need the simulator training. And then of course for the actual manufacturing you know we had a slow start to the year as you would expect, not a lot of people buying simulators, but so far in the third quarter, even though it's early August, we've already been awarded two simulators and we\u2019ll be converting those to contracts here in the next 30 to 45 days.  So we are seeing an uptick and you know it's going to drive growth in the second half. We\u2019re assuming \u2013 I\u2019ll let Jay give the exact numbers, double digit growth in commercial aviation. So it is a good market, it\u2019s got good technology and we're going to continue to run that business and evaluate and determine strategically what we want to do with it. But it's part of the company now and its contributing and we're excited about the uptick, so Jay? Jay Malave : Yeah, you know we step up in the back half of the year to about 30% growth and in the commercial business from 20% here in the second quarter. This is consistent with what we had expected you know coming into the year. The trends that we've seen or have seen thus far really in the month of July support that and so we've got some pretty good demand and a lot of activity going on in terms of our simulator sales and we\u2019re also seeing just increased leads as far as new cadet training in our academies and we're also seeing it in the simulator training. You know as Chris mentioned, the one thing to keep an eye on it for us, just that\u2019s more maybe company specific is that we do operate our simulator training in these regions that had been a little bit mixed as far as lockdowns opens up and back \u2013 locked back down and so \u2013 but that's the smallest piece of our business. Overall we're pretty confident with this 30% growth based on what we're saying. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey! Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I don't know if this is Chris or Jay, but is it impossible to quantify you know either kind of this year on the top line organic growth or even breaking down your bookings kind of year-to-date. How much of the growth is coming from new programs and I guess what I'm getting at is what kind of dilution on either new start programs are you trying to offset or deal with, and I guess Gautam kind of hit on it. You know are you seeing any more pricing pressure, competitive pressures from new start commercial players, you know like what we're seeing in the IVAS program. A - Chris Kubasik : Yeah Michael, thanks for that. It\u2019s a great, great question. I mean as I said, 6%, 6.2% organic growth. You know when I look at \u2013 as we go through the planning process and build up our annual operating plan, you know we start the year and we usually have pretty good visibility into what's already in backlog, you know so a lot of \u2013 it's kind of in the 70% range as we look forward, so you know going back to December of 2020 when we put out our guidance for \u201921 pretty good visibility, 70%. You know there's maybe 10-ish or so of follow-on.  So you know to answer your question, I guess you could say maybe 15%, maybe 20% at the most is revenue derived from new business to give you some idea. You know on the \u2013 it is driven by new programs or new contracts is kind of how I look at it. And as you suggest, some of those, especially with the DoD start out as cost plus contracts, you know then its migrated into a low rate production, a full rate production. So you know it's no secret that the cost plus margins tend to be lower than what we're currently realizing, so it's dilutive on that front and then even on the fixed price contracts. I think we\u2019re generally pretty conservative in how we start poking those until we retire and mitigate the risk. So maybe that answers your question there. As far as competitive pricing pressures, you know nothing new or different than what we\u2019ve had over the last decade or two in this industry. You know the selection criteria varies by program and I think our customers are very sophisticated and they look at the technical solutions, they look at past performance, they look at the management team, they look at cost, they look at schedule. So you know they are taking all those things into consideration.  Like I said earlier, to an earlier question, we try to find ways to work collaboratively with these new entrants, when and if they can add value and increase our probability of when. So, I don't know, Jay anything further? [Cross Talk] Jay Malave : Yeah, I mean it varies year-to-year. I'd say on the mix headwind, maybe at a gross level, you're talking anywhere around 25 basis points or so of headwind from year-to-year. And our challenge is really to offset that with about 50 basis points of productivity and so that we have a net 20 to 25 basis points improvement year-to-year. But again just, it will vary. I'd say that it\u2019ll probably be just like an average to think about. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys! It's Tyler [ph] on for Seth. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Just, I have a couple quick ones here. Can you just speak through the remaining schedule and maybe the execution risk on TR3 and just touching on the F-35 growth trends ahead? Chris Kubasik : Yeah, yeah let me give a quick F-35. You know we've talk about before we're a top 10 supplier, looking at it just the other day. We deliver about 1500 parts per jet. But the main focus has been TR3, where we have three components; I mentioned two of those three. We were successful in getting a production contract, which I think is indicative of the progress we've made. You know where we are right now is going through the safety of flight on these three products. One has completed the test. One is just about to start later this week and the third starts in October, so it's all per schedule. We're committed and focused on making sure we're ready for the lot 15 cut in. That's a big focus of both Lockheed and the [inaudible] and I'd say over the last six months the teams have made a lot of good progress. We are communicating, we understand the schedule, we understand the risk. So you know I feel good about our piece of that great program in contributing to Lockheed and allowing them to deliver their jet.  So as usual, in any development program there's directed change, there's government dependencies and stuff that we're used to and accustomed to and manage and work around. So I'd say probably feel better about the program now that I did in April. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. George Shapiro : Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, George. George Shapiro : Jay if you could go through the working capital days you expect for the end of the year. The goal I thought has been 52 days. This quarter it looks like working capital actually was up like about $135 million on a sequential basis, so just looking at where you are going there. And then just to verify, the $400 million reduction in sales was all due to the divestiture? Chris Kubasik : That's exactly right. I'll take the second question first, George. The two businesses, the multiple businesses that we divested at the end of the quarter were about $800 million of combined sales, so half here about $400 million impact for the second half and that\u2019s what's driving the reported sales to come down by that amount.  On the working capital it's also good observation. We reset again with the impact of these divestitures George, so at the end of the second quarter, on an adjusted basis we're 57 days and we're trying to get now to around 50-ish days. Part of this was planned, where we had some programs, deliverables in the first half of the year and those receivables will turn into billings and collections in the back half of the year.  We also had in the second quarter just high receivable balance with the timing of sales and so that will just normalize and we'll collect that cash here in the third quarter, and really for us the working capital reduction is the same as it's always been really for the year. It's really driving the inventory.  Two elements as I mentioned; one is just delivering on our key program milestones, so we can turn those into billings and into collations. And then second element is really delivering on our working capital initiatives and these are the things that we\u2019ve been talking about as far as reduced cycle time, improving our forecasting process. So you know a big second half for us, and it\u2019s actually the way we had planned it and we believe that we are on track for that. And I\u2019d say that end of the year George is really kind of 49 to 50 days on this new adjusted basis, taking out these divestitures. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Carter Copeland : Right in and under the hour. Thanks guys. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, Carter. Carter Copeland : Chris, I want to kind of end here with a higher level question on you know just strategy. When you came to L3 five years ago you know and think about where you've gotten now in terms of organic growth, inorganic growth and divestitures, the simultaneous integration, you're now at a point where you said you're done with the divestitures, you\u2019re not in a hurry on M&A. When you look at the next five years and try to maintain that internally disruptive mindset you know what's going to drive the next leg of the value creation formulary? Is it about R&D and development and customers and products more so than the value creation elements we've seen over the last five years? How do you continue to have that kind of mindset and in creating value over the next five? Chris Kubasik : Alright, Carter. Well, you got a good memory, so thanks for that and clearly it was a great team effort to get to this point.  I've talked somewhat about where we're trying to position L3 Harris and since I listened to all the questions throughout the day, you know I'll try to explain the vision here. We have our traditional primes which some great companies with a lot of cash and employees and processes. There was a couple of questions about these new entrants which are maybe a little more commercial mindset, a little more agile, maybe a little more creative, and what we're trying to do is put L3 Harris right in the middle of those two and take the best of the both and position ourselves to listen to our customers and be a trusted disrupter. I don't want to underestimate the importance of understanding the mission. So we know the mission, we know the customers and can we take that with our industry leading R&D investment and position ourselves for growth.  You know Jab[ph] C2 is something that's out there, that we can talk about more in future calls, but we really want to position ourselves to help our customers solve their problems and focus on the organic growth, focus on the margin improvement, the double digit free cash flow per share metrics; I think they're all going to drive value. So I ultimately want to be the most valuable defense technology company in the mind of our shareholders, in the mind of our customers and that's not necessarily the largest and that's what the team is also executing on. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning Chris and Jay, nice results. Hey Chris, just thinking about your e3, I guess it\u2019s you know becoming kind of ingrained in the culture now. Outside of kind of the operational excellence here you are driving, is there any kind of other buckets that still you see as the greatest opportunity to kind of show incremental savings? Chris Kubasik : Yes Peter, thanks for that question. We've actually taken e3 to be our operating model in the broadest sense. So a lot of times people think of it just on the continuous improvement initiative, but the approach we've taken on e3 is much, much broader. It encompasses EH&S, it encompasses the supply chain, ESG, continuous improvement, all those aspects, quality, roll throughput yield, everything that that drives our performance, including our performance on our programs where we look at our customer ratings, we look at award fee scores. We looked at our value management. So when you look at all those things holistically, each and everyone contributes to our cash flow and our profitability. So as we can bring down lead times or cycle times, improve the quality, we look at cost of poor quality, get the yield higher. Each and every one of those is part of our e3 umbrella, and that's really what's driving the success we've had to-date and the optimism we have for the future. Chris Kubasik : So with that I think I'll just kind of wrap it up. I appreciate everybody taking time to call in today. Hopefully as you heard, we have a strong quarter and the performance and the operational momentum is all positive. Obviously, it wouldn't be possible without my great leadership team and the 47,000 employees, so thanks again to them.  We feel good about the opportunities ahead. We're going to continue to execute and look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead as we focus on growing L3 Harris. Again, thanks for joining the call. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day!",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instruction]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on Forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release presentation and SEC filings. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Rajiv. And good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no Company is immune, including L3Harris to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our Company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full-year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. [Indiscernible] such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry best market position for radios. And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share, and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double-digit on both accounts. Shifting over to the third quarter, following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CES and an ISR aircraft awarded IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top-line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07 and we delivered record high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21 up 13% versus the prior year with solid free cash flow of 673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of 1.5 billion in the quarter.  Our execution against the Company's strategy priorities have been a key factor and value creation for all stakeholders, In spite of the pandemic. And we make progress in the quarter by advancing top-line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping, and returning capital to our owners. Starting with the top line, the revenue declined and the quarter fell short of our internal targets, largely due to 2 timing factors. At CES, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics focused businesses, notably tactical communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly a $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue.  And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow, and all told we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CES. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings, nor our win rates, and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over one times. In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs, and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full rate production contract with the U.S. Army. Second, in IMS we had a follow on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked to late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds is limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I have been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. Within the space domain on the classified side, we continue to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the intel Community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion.  And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review in the development of the missile tracking satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years, and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. Moving to the air domain, key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft.  On the B52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition on the international front, we were awarded an initial a $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our ISR capabilities that range from turbo props to business jets, to large aircraft. And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities.  Under the army H MS Program, we received over 200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full rate production awards out of a multibillion -dollar IDIQ, and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also want a majority share on the second program of record for the EM VGV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field ready cargos. So we were three for three on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation Class frigate with follow-on awards for the next chipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several $100 million opportunity for L3Harris.  We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One to provide Electro Optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another with an international ally, highlighting our superior undersea censor capabilities. Both would expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered power conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class block 5 upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbian Class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. We also had a key award within our mission networks business.  We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity, and strengthens L3Harris's long-standing relationship with Australia. Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a mid east customer to provide modernized, software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channels synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios.  When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to-date totaled roughly 900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. For the pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top-line growth. This win supported, another strong quarter for a book-to-bill 1.07 and 1.06 times year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion. We're up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend, as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. Shifting over to the outlook for budgets, we're pleased with the progress made on the FY22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR.  To plus ups from the HASC, SaaS, and SAC-D along with steadiness from HAC -D, combined with recent global events provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions which we're focused on providing. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top-line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies, and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of a $100 billion.  Pivoting the margin performance our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the Company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another 15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures.  This program is one of our key discriminators. And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First, is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out costs. A great example is the pilot program at our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year roll out ahead of us. The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence hand supply chain.  On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities, and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the Company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the Space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense, as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. On supply chain, the global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the Company, and are temporary in nature.  The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers are leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place with further opportunities. In the years ahead. Moving over to the portfolio, we put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the electron devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses with an AS for a combined 130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation.  Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. With that, I will hand it over to Jay. Jay Malave : Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1% lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays in ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CES were down 3% and 5% respectively, and absentee impacts would've been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in commercial aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6% with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance in cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds.  We exceeded our internal expectations by more than a 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering an E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs, and retirement of risk. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20, and pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08 then more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays.  Free cash flow was $673 million and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. The supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion comprised of 1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. Now let's turn to slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3% driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation Class frigate and classified programs. Operating income was up 4% and margins expanded a 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits, and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter, and 1.05 year-to-date with strength across the segment. In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in Space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The Space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the Space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 TR3 program with admission avionics, as well as program timing in Electronic Warfare and Intel and Cyber.  We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income, and integration benefits, more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in Space. [Indiscernible] to bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other Space awards. Next, Communication Systems, organic revenue was down 5% due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stemmed from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8 point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations as well as lower volume for a legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments.  In addition, the integrated vision and global communication solution businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double-digits versus the prior year and sequentially a strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System Award in the prior quarter. Operating income decreased 1% and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios, and integration benefits that outweighed supply-chain impacts in higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and integrated vision for monetization alongside key state level awards within public safety.  Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue increased 1% by our commercial aerospace business that was up over 40% from recover and training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish (ph) sales and mission networks, as well as lower fusing in ordinance systems volume due to contract roll-offs, along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded a 140 basis points to 14.4% at expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery, and integration benefits more than offset divestiture related headwinds. And finally book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date.  Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2% with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays at the segment level, we've maintained our sale s guides but for CES, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5%. Versus a prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within tactical communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single-digits. For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft while SCS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within Space and Intel & Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to guard timing slipping to the fourth-quarter within our classified business.  Buy and market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single-digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the Company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid to high-single-digits on average. Turning to margins, we've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to-date, E3 progress, and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays along with mix effects and new earlier stage programs, but still, strong progress for the full year.  From segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint. Delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. As shown on slide 11, the midpoint is now at 1293, that's $0.55 from improvement in operations in other items, including the release of contingencies, offset, additional divested earnings above $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays.  As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of 2.8 to 2.9 remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture, headwinds and now supply chain delays of over a $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3 to 5 day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And Capex is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures.  Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. None of these puts and takes were in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double-digits in 2021. Okay, let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core, and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft machinization, DOD, and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing, and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future.  As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall to be covered by the end of next year and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates, and tax rules. Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins, and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic related headwinds for seventh straight quarter, and delivered strong bottom line performance, and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one single part question. If you'd like to ask a question please [Operator Instructions] is in the question queue. You may press [Operator Instructions] if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it maybe necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you, our first question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Jay and Rajeev. Jay, you baited us rest right there so I have to ask, in terms of the rethink guides we saw from peers in both supply chain issues and program headwinds they noted, how are you guys thinking about 2022 revenue growth specifics on the multi-year revenue outlook just given you've previously talked about mid-single digits and now peers are calling for flat-to-low single-digit growth. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, Sheila It's Chris, I think let me make a couple of comments and then I'll lateral it over to Jay. And I think you said it, right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably three years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note and I want to go back and reinforce. And 1 was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses. And after the merger, how we're well-positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think puts us in a good position to support the war fighter.  Our Cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. I like what we've done in the air domain. While there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well-positioned in all these domains, and I think you see that reflected in our results and we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come.  So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago, and I've talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well-positioned with the DOD and all domains. We have a great revenue synergy, opportunity and process. And our international growth has been the bright spot over the last couple of years. So, as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall Company coming in in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the 800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay. Jay Malave : Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year. What I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well, as far as broad growth across the portfolio. I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4-6, we've said it will be probably towards the upper end this year. And we see a lot of the same going into 2022 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower force behind the back of international aircraft mechanization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual throughput related to mechanization in aircraft.  You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of mechanization, so that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver loaded mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards Electro Optical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that, that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low-to-mid-single digit next year and a final business with an IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the -- really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation Class frigate.  We've won some awards on the classified undersea sensors, and we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime and we expect that to deliver to frankly mid to high-single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well-positioned to do a low to mid-single-digit if not more. When you look at space in Air Boeing systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid-to-high single-digits growth there. Same thing with Intel & Cyber. We continue to see growth and demand in declassified areas of both of those businesses.  That will be tempered a bit by our airborne businesses we've seen this year that the transition, particularly mission avionics and on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year, as well as some program transitions on the electronic warfare, particularly in the F16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward, very easily, being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. And I'll go next to maybe AS, and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry. We continue to expect our traffic growth next year and we expect that business to grow in line with that. You can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. Mission networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And in our Defense Aviation, it's seeing a little bit of delays related to war timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver -- the segment can deliver low-to-mid-single-digit growth. And then finally CS. And we've talked about SATCOM the supply chain pressures there. This year that that business will be. Now about 10. And we see if we think about SATCOM, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and second quarter, we recover the back half. With that recovering the back half, we believe that business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our integrated vision solutions business, and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that.  We really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit initial framework is the right way to look at it, really across the portfolio. One last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures of next year. But again, starting with the organic, really low-to-mid-single-digit is probably the best place for us to be until we solidify our expectations and we'll do that in January for you. Hopefully that went around the horn and gave you some color within each of the segments, and really give you the source of why we feel confident in our gaining confidence and our ability to deliver that type of growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Jay Malave : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Thanks for that detail, Jay, that was very helpful. The question I have though is around supply chain, also facing a few issues at the moment. I was wondering what your plans are to mitigate these pressures over the next say 6, 12 months and what the implications could be for say your revenues and margins? Thanks so much. Chris Kubasik : Alright. Thanks, Rob. Let me kick it off and, again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call the last few days when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean, it's probably been a blur for all of us, but we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain challenge. Just eight months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room and the real focus there was on the first tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then we've learned a lot about the second, third, fourth tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency.  So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. Of course, we shifted and as I would say, we always focus on the supply chain, we added in remote working, the IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a roller coaster, but the key is then getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility, and all of that is improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year and, you know, August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe.  And that really threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming in our baseline is a 12-month delay. Until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time-frames out there but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. I will mention as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as D - pass ratings, which are the defense priorities in allocation system. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it. But they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. But that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers. Jay Malave : Sure. Just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer term commitments, our 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. We've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we speak secure alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualify them. We were redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate sources supply going into next year. And we're making crop progress across each of these areas, which again is why we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year. As far as supply chain specifically, supply-chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us when we think about 2022. Right now the I'm thinking about is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we were considering, that's something that we've got baked in, and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix, as well as supply chain, and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. The next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher but nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it. Robert Stallard : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P Morgan, please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I guess if I could slip in 2 quick ones here either for Chris or Jay. If you could just address maybe cash-flow next year, your $3 billion target and thoughts on cash flow, growth per share thereafter. And then maybe Jay, the guidance for the integration costs kind of stepping up. It seems to imply a fairly high level in the fourth quarter relative to what we've seen in the past. So maybe what's driving that at this point and where those go from here on out. Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Okay. I'll maybe take in a reverse order. On the integration costs, we actually saw a step up here in the third quarter. We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to two things. One is as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in costs. We expect to see continued spending in that area, probably through the mid-year, next year as we complete those factory consolidations. The other element is a really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the cost on related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect it to next year as well. Some for a period of time again, probably through the first 6 months. Jay Malave : And your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us to the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, I'm including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just increased use of assets. And so we're able to do that. We should be able to at least hold the working capital flat if not become a source of income, or source of cash flow and then we can have that added to drag drop-through of net income. And so really remains the same as far as our working capital. When you go back and look, we've got we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got seven sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really, you know, again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. This include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain.  We'll continue to work and Chris mentioned it on cycle time reductions in automations in the factory, as well as just negotiating better turns of our contracts, getting more advances where we're looking maybe compare to some of our other peers. Their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours, and so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity rich here, 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future. Chris Kubasik : [Indiscernible] in real quick on the integration costs. With the pandemic, we stayed agile and made some changes to strategies. And I'll just say in the IT world, we have laid out an architecture. And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we re-prioritized and made some changes which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. Same thing applied to supply chain.  We had a whole strategy and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identified risks. You've seen publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability in the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year, rolling that out in Q3 and Q4. So some of those things seem to make business sense to increase the cost and accelerate the expenditures based on what was going on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Chris, Jay, Rajeev. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about 2 of your programs, if I may. First, that recent GAO decision on the next-gen jammer. I'm curious as to what happens now, f you think the program gets re-competed, do you think changes are made to the program? And the second program I'd like to ask you about is the F-35. We had some long-term guidance come from Lockheed this week. I was just curious if you could discuss a bit how you think that might impact you, where that was relative to expectations, that sort of thing. Chris Kubasik : Yeah, sure. Rich. Good morning. Let me go with your next-gen jammer question. Just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including most recently using an independent reviewer. There's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And, you know, that's aligns with our strategy. And in the R&D investments that we've made and moving up the food chain, so I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other Company as to what they're going to do next. But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted we're ready to go, or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. We'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously the key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22, and then starts to grow again in '23. That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw -- from the prime, is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircrafts so that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the Aircraft Memory System. We just completed safety of flight certifications so that was quite exciting. A lot of positive emails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on our AMS. The panoramic cockpit display is entering qualification testing.  And then of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex and, again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard part is ahead of us here as the integration testing is going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned, everybody understands the goals, the challenges, and the critical path, and we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitment. Operator : That's a question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could give us some color on the Tactical IRS backlog where it stands now, kind of the longer-term outlook in that business. I know you gave a view on 22, but just longer term. What do you have in the pipeline both domestically and foreign and give any color you can provide there. Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Let me take a first shot at this one. Well, first of all, we have a record backlog of $1.2 billion, and that's the best we had in the past 10 years. So relative to that, there is no issue relative to demand, and book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.7 in year to date, we're almost at 1.2, so there is absolutely 0 issue with the demand. I highlighted some of the significant wins that we had recently with the army. You're well aware of those large, high IDIQs and how there is a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22 internationally. I think there continues to be lots of interest for this year. Asia-Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid East is a little flat, but as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching.  I think Jay did a good job, just of highlighting it. We look like -- we do about -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million, roughly, per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million and the fourth quarter probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range depending on supply chain. I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year. The 300 to 400 range, and then maybe ramping up to 500 plus for the second half of 22 and the first two quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So I'm trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe. I don't know Jay if there's more. Jay Malave : Yeah. Maybe just a little bit. Chris mentioned, I think in his remarks as well as far as a Middle East customer. What we have here, these are $1 billion plus type opportunities with this Middle East customer as well as the U.K. and Australia. And what we've been able to do in each case is when front-end type of contracts. And so right now with this particular country we won about 5,000 radios, that could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. The same thing goes with the U.K. We just want an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios. Net positions as well, for what could be it also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, billion-dollar plus program.  If similarly, Australia you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios. In our ballpark, we also want an opportunity there to do some crypto monetization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us in positions j us t very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries, we've got a DoD opportunity coming up on either this quarter or next quarter with the marine corps. We feel confident in our positioning there and our products offering for that. And so we're confident and bullish about the opportunities for the Tactical Radio business going forward in our positioning as well. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey. Good morning, guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Kristine Liwag : Chris, segment margins were 19.5% in the quarter. Rounding, you're at that 20% margin you've been targeting, but your full-year 2021 guide implies a step-down in 4Q. Can you provide more details on the puts and takes and how we should think about margins going into 2022? I know it's too early for a 2022 guide, but is 20% a 4? Chris Kubasik : Good to see on a Friday. Nobody's lost their sense of humor. Now I said earlier, everything related to the merger is going to go on quicker and better than maybe anyone had expected or planned. And we've talked about a 25 basis point increase year-over-year. So the way I look at it is we're a year or 2 ahead of that target. And the goal for '22 and beyond will be to, at a minimum maintain these margins, but look for ways to increase it. I mean, some of the things that contributed, and I'll let Jay give you more details on Q3. We've really been focusing on our discretionary spend the SG&A. I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. We continue to invest in the irad at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioned us for this growth that we talked about going forward. And these -- the mix from these new awards -- talked about some of these awards being delayed.  I think, you know, most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if there are cost plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative so -- but those slipping to Q4. I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it on an annual basis, and year-over-year progress is looking good. And we're not going to give up, and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. The E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. We're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker.  We talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value-engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable, we talked about designing for manufacture, design for supply chain. All those initiatives are ongoing and getting better each and every time, so I don't have [Indiscernible]. Further color you want to give? Jay Malave : Yeah. Just on Q4, as you mentioned, we will see some just newer awards which have lower margins on it. And then the Tactile Communication business steps down in Q4, so I'll put pressure on the margins from a business mix perspective. And so that's really the driver for Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Jay Malave : Good morning. Doug Harned : You've talked a lot about supply chain today and a lot of companies have lot of industrial companies, whether they are in defense and honest talked about it. But I'd like to -- what I wanted to understand is in -- supply chain issues have clearly held you back some in communication systems this year and you talked about the first half of next year. But unlike some commercial businesses, I wouldn't expect any of the deliveries and revenues that you were expecting to have gone away. And when you think forward, should we expect the snapback eventually here, where you've just, you've built up -- you've got building up of a backlog of demand and we should actually see what I would think of as a surge when we get into 2023, when you're finally delivering on things that have been delayed? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Now, Doug, that's great question. I think you hit it. I tried to maybe to subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right. What we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast to programs which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses you're forecasting demand, Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months. It's in-advance like we used to in the past. So when you look at the supply chain challenges to the extensive if a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right. You will see that as a bow wave.  The majority of our Company, and I think the whole industry, uses a percent complete or over time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you are going to see is a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the Deepak ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts and that's something that's very important to all of us and we\u2019ll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments.  The revenue shortfall was our focus on over driving and challenging the team to get the year-over-year growth. But as far as the contracts we're tracking and we're in constant communication with all of our customers and they understand where we are. So I don't know if that helps you, Doug, but that's a long way of saying I agree with you. Doug Harned : Yes. Doug. You got it exactly right. I mean, 2022 I mentioned it would grow. We'd love it to snap back in 2022, but that's unlikely, but we would expect that recovery to be in '23. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Thanks. Good morning, Chris. And Chris, thanks for all the details on that kind of the progress we're making on E3, but kind of just tying back to your comments that you've been operating in 7 quarters in the pandemic that feel like eternity but did -- you set up the E3 program before the pandemic, did you get any kind of opportunities that evolved during the last 7 quarters where you think there is significantly more upside that you can do from the 350 million target that you put out there? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Now, Peter, the 350 target we threw out was the cost synergies from the merger. We'll be putting a bow on that here in the next few quarters, and we've over-driven the synergies that we laid out. Anything post the merger synergies will count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on International as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double-digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the data to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships so it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face-to-face.  But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently and have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Haven't less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes or highlight it in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated, and the difficulty getting labor, but now we're picking that pace back up again. Yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. Thank you for the question, Peter. I guess with that, we'll just wrap it up for the day. Obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who were focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay, and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to L3Harris Technologies Fourth Quarter Calendar Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. In addition, following our 8-K filed earlier in the month, we'll be speaking to our 2021 results and our prior 4 segment structure, and our 2022 outlook will be in our realigned 3 segment structure that also shifts pension items to the corporate level, furthering operational transparency. With that, Chris, over to you. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome Michelle Turner to this morning's call. She is an experienced financial executive with diverse operational experience, including 2 decades in the aerospace and defense industry. She joins us from Johnson & Johnson. She was the CFO of their supply chain organization. I'm excited to have Michelle on the team and look forward to our partnership. So welcome to week 2, Michelle. Michelle Turner : Thanks, Chris. It's great to be back in the defense industry and to be part of the L3Harris team. I've been following the merger, and I'm excited about leveraging my experiences to further our strategy of being a non-traditional prime. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we reported our 2021 earnings, and I'm pleased with the result. Our company delivered another solid year of bottom line performance, growing EPS and free cash flow per share by 12% and 9%, respectively. It wasn't, however, without its challenges as the pandemic stressed our supply chain at a time when budgets remain uncertain. Organic revenues were up 2% for the year, and our margin performance was exceptional as merger cost synergies, alongside E3 savings, enabled expansion of 110 basis points. Looking ahead to this year, we initiated guidance today that reflects current market conditions. Organic revenues are to be up 1% to 3% with steady to rising segment margins. And when combined with the share count decline, we expect EPS of $13.35 to $13.65, reflecting another solid year of growth. Our free cash flow guide of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion incorporates current tax regulations, which requires us to capitalize R&D expenditures beginning in 2022 versus the prior practice of annual deductions resulting in tax cash payment increases. Excluding this impact, free cash flow per share growth would have been up by double digits. We'll provide more details on these figures later on the call. Our focus on both value creation and advancing our strategy of leading as a non-traditional prime has driven our success to date. Moreover, in recent months, we made progress in our focus areas of growing the top line, strengthening our operations and augmenting our disciplined allocation of capital. Let's start with the top line. With the integration of the company largely behind us, we're progressing on our efforts to grow the business through a 3- pronged approach : first, investing in our capabilities; second, bidding, winning and priming more programs; and finally, expanding our international presence. Our award activity throughout the year demonstrated traction against all 3 of these efforts across all domains. As a leading defense technology company, we're maintaining our industry-leading R&D spend as a percentage of revenues, with an emphasis on open architecture, multifunction, and software-defined solutions across our broad portfolio of capabilities. This remains instrumental in expanding our revenue synergy pipeline as we reached a cumulative 1 billion in funded orders, including a contract for a classified next-generation system in the fourth quarter. We are also accelerating momentum with internal investments in the maritime and cyber domains. Our leading sensor and integration capabilities for naval solutions on programs, such as the Columbia and Virginia class submarines, led to awards of several hundred million 2021. In addition, we received $100 million sole-source IDIQ from the U.S. Navy for cyber hardened electronic attack shipboard systems in the quarter. Our capabilities position us for multibillion dollar opportunities across ship classes and geographies that we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. We also expanded our external investments to broaden overall offerings in various capability sets. We're making calculated investments in partnerships and companies so we can bring unique technological solutions to global defense customers. There will be more on this topic throughout the year. Next, let me update you on the progress we've made as a non-traditional prime, what we call being a trusted disruptor. Our positioning at the nexus of traditional defense players and new experimental commercial entrants aligns well with the U.S. government's desire for agile, advanced and affordable solutions to address near-peer threats. We expect budget dollars to continue gravitating in this direction. A notable example is within the space domain and the need for responsive satellites that can be rapidly procured and deployed to address a range of threats. We were awarded over $0.5 billion in responsive satellite contracts as a prime in 2021, including a $200 million award for a classified mission within the Intel Community in the fourth quarter and we have considerable and exciting opportunities ahead of us. Turning to International. We continue to see demand for our defensive solutions that are aligned with U.S. export policies and insure partner security. And with a book-to-bill of 1.1 on solid revenue growth in 2021, our strategy is solid. We had a strong growth in our ISR aircraft missionization business from a key NATO customer with awards of over $600 million, including $70 million in the fourth quarter, which is part of a broader multibillion dollar opportunity set we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. In addition, our international Tactical Communications business continued to experience robust order activity for land modernization in the UK, Australia and a Mid-East country that totaled approximately 500 million for the year and over 200 million in the quarter. This pairs well with the expanding DoD modernization goals, supporting multiyear growth potential for our business. In fact, just last week, we were awarded a $750 million IDIQ by the U.S. Marines to manufacture the Falcon IV multichannel handheld radio that meets modern crypto security standards, while providing them resilient networking capabilities. Overall, I'm pleased with the tangible progress we made in 2021 as we delivered a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 and grew our organic backlog by 5%. Let's pivot to operations. Our integration efforts were quite successful and will wrap up in early 2022. We also continue to drive a performance culture through our E3 program, that pervades the organization and has been key in mitigating the unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic. We talk about the key components of our E3 program, factory optimization, engineering excellence, supply chain and overhead management. In 2022, we expect these factors to at least offset predicted inflationary pressures for both labor and materials, which we'll look to improve upon as the year progresses. We're off to a good start with our segment and business consolidation efforts. And over the last 2 quarters, we've delivered margins at or above 19% on a consolidated basis or approximately 16% on a segment basis using our new reporting structure. We've also reached several key operational milestones this quarter. Within Space, we successfully completed critical design reviews for 2 major responsive satellite programs. First, the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer; and second, the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor, known as HBTSS. We are gearing up for prototype launches of 5 satellites over the next 2 years. Within our ISR business, we completed a key flight test and received a supplemental type certificate for the first Compass Call crossdeck aircraft, the U.S. Air Force's missionized business jet. This strategic aircraft arrived in our Waco, Texas facility in the fourth quarter, where we began the next phase of modification. It is scheduled for delivery to the customer later this year. Lastly, our WESCAM product line within our electro optical business concluded its transition to a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and delivered a record high number of turrets in the fourth quarter as well as for the year. Concerning our supply chain, the environment continues to be fluid. For 2022, we expect supply chain disruptions to continue into the first half. As a result, our team is set to continue utilizing the various tools we outlined to address the challenges, such as engaging with lower tiers of the supply chain, accelerating our purchase commitments, utilizing  designations and leveraging smart inventory in selected areas. Shifting to capital allocation. Our focus remains on maximizing cash generation and strengthening our portfolio, while sustaining a shareholder-friendly approach. Growth in free cash flow per share is a key metric for us. This will remain a 2022 focus as we drive our profit growth, reduce working capital days, continue tax planning and manage capital expenditures. When combined with our share repurchases in 2021 and our current target of $1.5 billion of repurchases this year, we expect free cash flow per share growth of 10%, assuming the R&D tax credit is repealed, contributing to double-digit annual growth since the merger. Regarding the dividend, it remains part of our balanced capital allocation framework with opportunities to grow it further as we've done in prior years. Finally, with respect to M&A, we'll be opportunistic and use our balance sheet capacity judiciously to complement our capital return program. Let me now provide details on our 2021 results and the consolidated guidance for 2022, and I'll ask Michelle to fill in the segment and other details on the outcome. So let's start on Slide 4. I'll refer to all 2021 figures in our prior 4 segment structure given our realignment became effective in early 2022. Fourth quarter organic revenue was down 1% versus the prior year. CS and AS were down 11% and 5%, respectively, with electronic component shortages in its supply chain, weighing down the tactical business at CS, while AS was impacted by the timing of awards. IMS saw solid 6% growth from continued ISR aircraft missionization activity and the SAS segment was up 2%, driven by growth in our responsive space franchise. Margins expanded 70 basis points to 19.2%, with the most notable drivers being E3 performance and integration benefits, which offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal outlook by 100 basis points through favorable mix related to award timing, continued strong E3 performance and by containing supply chain impacts. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 5% to $3.30 as shown on Slide 5. For the full year, organic revenue was up 2% and in line with our prior guidance at the consolidated level. At the segment level, IMS and SAS were up 5% and 3%, respectively, while CS and AS were down in low single digits. CS would have been up in low single digits, excluding these supply chain impacts. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 19.1%, exceeding our prior guidance of approximately 18.75% and we're more than 75 basis points ahead of our midpoint at our initial guide with E3 performance and integration benefits being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 12% or $1.35, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 6% lower share count that overcame divestiture and supply chain headwinds, enabling us to deliver double-digit EPS for another year. Our full year free cash flow came in just below the bottom end of our prior guidance range as we consciously built inventory levels to reduce supply chain risk. With this cash flow, along with proceeds from divestitures, we repurchased $3.7 billion in stock and paid over $800 million in dividends, returning about 10% of our market cap to our shareholders. Next, on Slides 6 through 9, we provide details on segment results, which are largely consistent with prior commentary. In the interest of time, we can take questions in a few minutes so that we can shift our discussion to the 2022 guide. Starting with the top line. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $17.3 billion to $17.7 billion, implying organic growth of 1% to 3% and reflecting growth in every segment. We expect a weaker first half down in the mid-single digits, driven by continued global supply chain impacts in our product-heavy businesses at CS, along with international ISR aircraft award timing IMS given tough compares. We expect high single-digit growth coming in the second half of 2022. Segment operating margins are expected to be 16% to 16.25%, positioning us for another year of expansion and are expected to follow sales with more profit in the second half of the year. This, combined with a 4% lower share count, will result in 2022 EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. On free cash flow, our $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion guide includes a $600 million to $700 million headwind from the R&D tax policy. So with that, I'll turn it over to Michelle. Michelle Turner : Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to my engagement with the analyst and investor community at upcoming events and conferences. I'll continue now on Slide 10 with our 2022 segment details and our realigned 3 segment structure as well as provide additional color on the 2022 EPS bridge and cash flow. Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, up 2% to 4% driven by maritime expansion, classified growth in defense aviation and continued recovery in our commercial aerospace business. ISR aircraft timing from a tough compare is expected to drive a low to mid-single-digit decline in the first half with high single-digit growth coming in the back half of the year. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 13.5% to 13.75%, with E3 program savings more than offsetting program mix impacts. In Space & Airborne Systems, we expect revenue of $6 billion to $6.1 billion or flat to up 2%, driven by our traction and responsive space, along with classified strengths in Intel & Cyber, which will be moderated by continued pressure in our airborne businesses as we transition to modernization over the coming years. Segment operating margins are expected to be within a range of 12.5% to 12.75% as E3 program savings offset mix headwinds from key growth programs within space. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion or up 2% to 4% from modernization demand in Tactical Communications, with supply chain delays netting an expected mid-teen decline in the first half and strong double-digit growth in the back half of the year, along with recovering sales in Public Safety. Growth will be moderated by a flattish outlook in broadband and integrated vision solutions. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 24.25% to 24.50% as our E3 program savings will more than offset inflationary pressures within Tactical Communications. Now turning to the EPS bridge on Slide 11. As Chris said, we expect full year EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. Of this increase, operations will contribute $0.62, along with a lower share count for $0.60, overcoming headwinds from divested earnings and residual supply chain impacts as well as lower pension income and other items of $0.05. On cash flow, our outlook reflects a modest working capital improvement, $330 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. We expect to deploy roughly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through $1.5 billion in buybacks, barring any strategic M&A. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Chris. Christopher Kubasik : All right. Thanks, Michelle. Well done. So to sum it up, 2021 performance demonstrated our ability to deliver strong bottom line results in a dynamic environment, with our 2022 outlook reflecting growth in all key metrics. With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. Operator : . And our first question is from David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Michelle. Michelle Turner : Good morning. David Strauss : Chris, could you maybe touch on the budget outlook, what you saw in the fiscal '22 authorization markup. And if that becomes approach, what that might mean for you guys? And as well as what you're assuming in terms of CR? And then last one, a little bit more detail on the individual buckets within SAS in terms of what you're expecting for each of the individual businesses relative to that flat to up 2% for the overall business? Christopher Kubasik : Thanks, Dave. Let me start with the CR, the continuing resolution. We're assuming a half year CR. Meaning, by April 1, we'll move forward. And I just look at the fact that the President State of the Union speech moved to March. So I'm assuming he wants to have a budget at that point in time. So that's what we factored in. Obviously, I think like others, it is a full year CR, will provide a couple of hundred millions of top line headwind, which is not unexpected. Relative to the budget, I think we were all pleased to see the markup. I think that could be a good foreshadowing of the future. We don't have a fight up yet, but we continue to think aspirationally that mid-single-digit growth is something that we can achieve. As I've said before, I really like our portfolio, the fact that we're in all these domains. And as I laid out in my prepared comments, we continue to invest hired to grow. We're working with some of these new commercial entrants. We're priming and bidding more, and international has been a good story. So that's how I see the budget rolling out. Look forward to more information there. When go to SAS, the components of SAS, there's focus on the key sectors. We see -- continue to see space growing in the mid-single digits. We were probably a little more bullish back in October, but there continue to be delays in contract awards, either directly or indirectly related to the CR. So Space, I see mid-single digit this year, Intel & Cyber is one of our hot businesses, continuing to grow high single digits. So that's maybe a little better than what we had told you in October. Mission Networks, which we moved from AS into SAS as we collapsed the segment, has been and always continues to be in that low single-digit growth, mainly doing work for the FAA. But what we're seeing the decline is in our air sectors, Mission Avionics and EW combined. And that's really almost entirely tied to the F-35 program. As you know, the TR3 development is rolling off and production is ramping up. So as I quantify it, I think I've said before that 2022, we're going to have about $150 million decline in revenue just attributed to the F-35 program. We'll see that start to return to growth in '23. But this is just a roll-off of development on TR3 and then moving into production on the 3 components that we provide to that aircraft. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Welcome, Michelle. Chris, maybe you had $0.18 at least baked into your '22 guidance for the supply chain adjustment, and that's obviously better than the $0.29 in '21. So maybe just your confidence around the supply chain? And what kind of visibility, what's baked into the $0.18? And then just also, Michelle made a comment about just modest working capital improvement. Maybe you could just discuss a little bit what's behind that? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, relative to the supply chain, we think we're doing a pretty good job over the last maybe 6 or 9 months, as I mentioned, with getting more visibility into the second, third tier supply chain. We've invested in tools that give us that visibility. So we've talked previously about a $200 million revenue headwind in '21. We see that continuing in the first half of 2022. And I think where we've been maybe a little more conservative than in October as we see that recovery bouncing back in the second half of '22 and then also in early '23. So think of that about a $100 million headwind each quarter in 1 and 2, and then maybe getting 100 back in the second half and 100 back in early '23 from a revenue. And of course, that brings along the related operating income. So that's how we see it. But it's a dynamic area. It's mainly been focused on electronic components. But we're monitoring it and managing it at all sectors and all segments. And it feels like we've turned the corner, but we'll keep you up to date kind of quarter-to-quarter as things change. So relative to working capital, as we try to get to the guidance, we ended the year at 52 working capital days. We'll bring that down a couple of days as we go to that $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion guide. Michelle? Michelle Turner : Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on the working capital. If you think about it, we built smart inventory at the end of 2021. And so we expect Tactical Communications comes back in the second half. We'll leave some of that down. And then there's also an advantage from an ISR perspective on advanced payments that we're anticipating at the end of the year as well. So it's going to help free cash flow within 2022. Christopher Kubasik : And I'll just throw in, Peter, just our definition of supply chain is pretty broad. We're throwing into labor, we're throwing in material and we're throwing in inflation. So all that contributes to the $0.18. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : In Communication Systems, there you've clearly been hit by around COVID, supply chain, we've also got inflation, that would be hitting fixed price -- commercial fixed price contracts there. If you were to think of 2022 without these headwinds having been there, what would you see Communication Systems looking like in terms of growth margin? And is this something, given that it's -- there's been -- there's a headwind there, is this something that we should see all coming back when we move out to 2023? Or is there just going to be some lost demand and margin here? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Doug, that's a great question. Something we spend a lot of time looking at. I don't see any loss. I think this is just a timing issue. And as we were looking through the business, just the other day, I mean it's had a great book-to-bill in 2021. Now some of that is due to less revenue, but we have a record backlog, an all-time high in backlog, which is an indication that we continue to win new business. And I mentioned just the marines recently, which is a winner-take-all competition. So we're very excited to have won that $750 million IDIQ. And throughout '21, I think we were pretty clear in all the head-to-head competitions we won the majority share. So the demand is there. The modernization is happening that's in our backlog. And everything indicates quite -- to be doing quite well. What we would have had without supply chain risks probably would have been 300 basis points or 400 basis points more growth as these things slip into '22. And as I mentioned, potentially '23, depending on how the supply chain plays out. So at a high level, that's kind of how I see tactical. You asked about Communications Systems in totality. So the PSPC business, a lot of that is tied to state and local municipalities. As we said, that ought to rebound as the budgets get back in place. And we had some key wins last year, but we expect that to continue to grow. BCS, our Broadband Communication Systems in Salt Lake. A lot of that is still tied to the next-gen jammer start-up and some new opportunities that they're pursuing. So we feel pretty good about our communications. I've got, for the full year '22, Tactical up mid-single digits, maybe even a little better. BCS and IBS are kind of flattish area and PSPC should bounce back with the budget improvement. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Hi, Chris, and welcome, Michelle. Maybe I wanted to bridge that growth from 2022, the 1 to 3. Chris, you've talked about it in a bunch of moving pieces, some of the CS softness, Airborne and F-35, you mentioned versus the mid-single-digit growth profile you have. And then maybe just a follow-up on the SAS growth, perhaps being softer. What are you seeing there in terms of trends longer term? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We had said in October that would be in the lower to mid-single digits, which best I can tell everybody is interpreting is 2 to 4 and now we're at 1 to 3. So it's a it's a close call there. And again, I'm the accountable exec here for given the guidance with Michelle and my team. But I really tried to look at the current market conditions. Everything I see from not having a budget, at CR and supply chain risk, it seems appropriate to guide. So I don't see this as a major change from 90 days ago, but I'm trying to give you the visibility.  I mean, basically, the only thing that really changed -- and I know it gets a little complicated as we went from 4 segments to 3, but we can talk about that later. But we filed more than enough documents with the SEC and our  trying to bridge it. But IMS and CS basically did not change from October. Those were kind of in the 2% to 4% range. As I said, the big changes in SAS, we can argue how big a change that was. But clearly, downward pressure on the top line. And as I mentioned in an earlier comment or response, most of that is driven by the air domain and F-35 specifically. The good news is that's a well-known program that everybody has visibility into. So we have confidence that as we negotiate lots 16 and 17, prepare for the cut in of our technology on Lot 15, that there's a lot of certainty and predictability in our revenue stream. So we do see '23, '24, '25 coming back. Longer term, just within SAS, I mean I really like what we're doing in the Space business, both on the satellites and the ground vehicles -- or the ground stations. We pretty much control our own destiny. You've heard us talk about the missile defense area, and we'll be launching 5 prototypes in the next 2 years. And then I think there'll be further opportunities to down-select from 2 to 1. And if we perform and have success, there could be billions of dollars of opportunities. So I really like where we are in Space with the response of SAS. We still work with a lot of our industry partners, providing them payloads for the exquisite sat. So -- and we've been successful in winning a lot of ground station. So I'm excited about the space. Intel & Cyber continues to grow. That's an international business doing work with the 5 ICE countries. It's probably the hottest market we have. And again, I think long term, there's going to be more and more mission networks. We have a competition, a recompete, coming up for the FAA and hopefully sometime this year, but that continues to be a good business and solid and steady. And then it's really all about air and the F-35 program, the EW capabilities for the F-16. Internationally, we're on the B-52, and that's a complete overhaul relative to EW capabilities. And then we think we're well positioned on next-gen aircraft, but all that is classified as you know, and more to come is that those decisions and down selects are made. So longer term, SAS, just like the other 2 segments, should be able to grow. And that's our plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Chris, you commented about -- so you had a good year on the export side in 2021. I was wondering what your expectations are for 2022? Whether these are various tensions around the world, particularly in Eastern Europe could have some benefits for orders? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No, Robert, good point. I mean for the last couple of years, our international business has been growing double digit. And I think our strategy, which is somewhat unique, I think, compared to others. We have focused countries, 10 focus countries, where we have executives full time in the countries. And then we use our distributors and reps more for the product. So it seems to be paying off, and we've been able to see that grow. I mean beyond '22 and beyond, we're seeing mid-single-digit growth. But as you said, anything can change rather quickly, especially in the European area. So our Tactical Communications business is generally a quick turn business, and I think could be pretty opportunistic as well as our Night Vision business. So we're always available for quick turns when tensions get tight or there's new demand or requests. So I think there could be some potential growth upside that we haven't completely factored in. And again, a lot of our products that I alluded to are more on the defensive side. So ISR situational awareness has always been key. We've migrated to the biz jets and we've talked about the success of that strategy and programs in NATO and the Mid-East. And again, we have multiple other countries we're working with over the next few years. And then we also, being somewhat -- I hate to say, platform agnostic, but we're working with different parts of the world. We have King Air ISR capabilities. We have large aircraft and bizjets. So they're all working reasonably well. We'll let you know as things move forward in the international world, but optimistic for 2022. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Michael Maugeri : Following on Peter's question from earlier, sort of taking a step from the '22 free cash guide out of a year. Is $3 billion or better what we should be looking at for 2023? And then is free cash growth in 2023 all earnings growth? Or where, if we can, should we expect to see you to continue to generate working capital efficiency out in '23? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take that in reverse order. We absolutely expect to continue to see working cap improvement. We've talked aspirationally of getting down to the low 40s. We ended the year at 52 for 2021, 52 working capital days. We should be able to take out a few more days in '22, which still gives us a long runway for '23 and beyond. So notwithstanding the R&D item, which everybody is confident will be repealed or deferred for 4 years, but haven't happened yet. So we figured we'd just give guidance, give you the pieces. But we've effectively kind of guided to a 2.8 to 2.9 for 2022, if you use the midpoint of the R&D 600 to 700. So that should put us on track to get close or around the $3 billion mark in 2023. Starting with top line growth, which will generate more OI in earnings. And then, of course, the working capital. I tried to look at maybe implied in your question, if we go back a couple of years or 2.5 years, we talked about getting to $3 billion in 2022. And obviously, coming up short. Just thought I'd hit that head on. I mean, clearly, we talked about some of the supply chain decisions we've made, which was a little bit of a headwind. At that time, we didn't know there'd be a stimulus bill that's affected social security payments. So many of us defer those payments back in 2020 for the rules, and now we're paying them back. So we have almost $100 million of social security payments that we have to pay in 2022 that's in our guidance. And we divested more businesses than we had initially modeled. So I continue to like to look at free cash flow per share. I went back to day 1. And while we don't really disclose or publish it, we had a plan of $14.50 on free cash flow 2.5 years ago in 2022. If you do the math today, I'll do it for you, we're at $14.80. So on our free cash flow per share, we're ahead of where we were kind of be 2.5 years ago, even though we're coming up short on the $3 billion. So hopefully, that might make sense and gave you all the answers to your question. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Richard Safran : Michelle, welcome to the call. Once again, you're highlighting E3 as a tailwind in '22. I was curious as to how much runway you think you have left with respect to A3 cost savings? You've been reporting the E3's benefit to margins for quite some time. And I was just curious if you think longer term, you have continued room for meaningful improvement? In your answer, if you could get a bit more specific about where you think the additional benefit comes from? Christopher Kubasik : Thanks. Great question. And the answer is obviously going to be yes. I think the system and the methodology we've put in place has been a success, and we expect it to continue. I mean to give you some -- historically, I think a lot of these continuous improvement programs start out focused on the supply chain, which is a good thing in direct labor optimization, and we do that. But we've taken a much broader approach, and one area is just the ability to improve our yield. So we're looking at our rolled throughput yield at all of our facilities. They come in different sizes and different flavors. But if we can obviously improve those, yields 5 basis points or 10 basis points, it just contributes to the bottom line. This year, we collapsed from 4 segments to 3. That brought us savings, any savings I get, I put under the E3 umbrella. But that brings about some savings. When we first merged, we had 19 sectors rolling up to these 4 segments. Today, we're down to 14. We might have sold 1 or 2. We collapsed a couple more. So we're getting synergies in the organizational structure. With the -- we've been investing in systems. We're putting in a manufacturing execution system in one of our large facilities that have a lot of manual and paper processes. Those are now getting updated, and everything is getting to be electronic. So I think that is already starting to show benefits, and the system is not even fully implemented yet. And we'll roll that out to other facilities and factories. We have a process that we call our perimeter cost, where we look at the entire cost of each and every facility. And we look where the big bucks are, and we target our E3 projects, of which we have hundreds at those larger dollar items. I mean this comes down to a lot of this links in with our ESG or environmental initiatives and whether it's energy and utilities, all those types of things. I think, are maybe some specific examples. Still try to figure out, as I said, and I think everyone said, if we return to -- and do things the way we used to pre-COVID, we've missed an opportunity. So I think I've told you -- before the merger, 98% of the workforce came to work every day, and that was kind of the norm. And today, we're at about 70%, full-time on-site about 20% hybrid, 10% remote. So that also brings different savings and facilities and such. So we're looking at all those things, Rich.  To be specific on E3 -- but in a broader sense, I think implied in your question was the overall segment growth. So not within E3 is the recovery of the supply chain, more international sales at higher margins, as an example. I mentioned F-35 transitioning out of development into production. I think we all expect higher production margins and development margins. And we still have a little commercial business with the aviation and PSPC and as those turn around. So when I look at all these things, it's hard not to see where we can continue to grow margins for the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Hey, Chris, and welcome, Michelle. Wanted to just ask about capital allocation. So you've done a lot of divestments. Obviously, you're guiding $1.5 billion of buybacks. What's the appetite for M&A? Again, do you see any bigger opportunities presenting themselves? Or do you think it's going to be more of a tuck-in variety? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, good question. Well, first of all, the 1.5 of buybacks is directly tied into the free cash flow guide. If the R&D matter gets resolved, that formally increase the free cash flow guide and bring up the buyback to $2 billion, just to be clear on that one. Yes, there's absolutely an appetite for M&A. We have a new leader in our strategy and M&A organization. And we've got a process where we've been looking strategically as to where we might want to make acquisitions. My -- you said big, it's always hard to quantify these adjectives. I mean, having come from L3, I'm probably not a huge fan of lots of little $50 million, $70 million, $100 million deals. It just causes a lot of challenges with integration and such. I think the multibillion, $5 billion and beyond, there aren't many targets, and that's a lot. So I'd say $0.5 billion, $1 billion, $1.5 billion type size to probably call those medium kind of makes sense. So as you know, there are a whole lot of opportunities out there, but we're in discussions proactively and reactively. Nothing on the horizon or foreseeable. I mean, if we make an acquisition in 2022, that would be great. If we don't, we don't. It's not like burning platform, but we're running a disciplined process. We initially started by looking at things strategically. Followed by operationally, if we were to buy it, what are we going to do? How are we going to integrate it? How do we keep the workforce? Do we move people to keep them separate? What are the synergies? I think with the big merger we just did, we have a lot of talent and skills in figuring out revenue and cost synergies. And then financially, working with Michelle, we'll figure out the hurdle rates and the cash returns and the more traditional piece. But that would be the order that goes in. I'll just comment. I think a lot of people have been asking about some of the recent news surrounding Aerojet Rocketdyne, and that decision's impact on the industry. And I know there's different commentary out there, but I'm not familiar with the details of that decision or the rationale, but it seemed to be specific to vertical integration. So relative to what we're thinking about, I don't expect any opposition or hurdles if and when we get to the point where we need to have approvals. And that's something we would consider and evaluate before moving forward. But I think it's business as usual from my perspective, for L3Harris relative to our portfolio, and the things we might consider down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : It's actually Elizabeth on for Ron this morning. I just wanted to follow on to the last question, I think you hit on a little bit. But given what we've seen in the new administration, do you think in general, the environment for defensive M&A has changed? So you said not for you, but maybe just in general, do you think it's changed? In many ways, do you think big defense M& A is over? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No. Elizabeth, I would think these decisions and policies change administration by administration. So with the current administration, it would appear that, that big M& A, if that was considered big, is potentially over, at least until there's a change in administration at some future point who may or may not have new policies. So as I said, I haven't really looked at and probably won't have the time to figure out what the specific case was. But I think it's always a predisposition for more competition and less vertical integration. And when I look at the L3Harris merger, that went through relatively quickly. It was complementary. We're now in all 5 domains. It made perfect sense. It was just a very small business that did have -- wouldn't allow for competition. So it was divested. So I think you can look at these things pretty quickly and figure out if they're going to go through or not. And I continue to believe that there's -- from our perspective, there will be plenty of opportunities. I think at some point, there's a reluctance to have really big guys get bigger. So I kind of like where I am relative to the real big guys. So that's how I see it from my perspective. We're going to run our playbook and see what happens. And others either will or won't be in the game, but I like where we are. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Welcome, Michelle. Two quick things. Chris, on the talent side, how difficult is it to get people? And what kind of labor inflation are you seeing? And how is that impacting fixed-price contracts? And then, Michelle, just on the tax situation, if you could give us the mechanics? We've been talking about this with everybody for a week. But what are the mechanics of this higher tax rate? Will you pay cash taxes at the higher rate quarterly until you find out what's going to happen and then if you could just clarify that. Michelle Turner : Yes. So I'll start from an R&D perspective. And you're right, there has been a lot of fluidity in the calls this week. And so just to reiterate what we have in our guidance. So our free cash flow assumes with the $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion, that assumes $600 million to $700 million related to the R&D tax amortization. And I think it's important to note that this is the tax call that's in effect today, right? So as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And so barring a repeal or deferment, this will have an impact on our results. And so for us, it's about $2 billion over 5 years, and then it goes away. So that will go down to 0. I think to the point about paying it, not paying it, that's certainly something that we're looking at right now. But just to give you a sense of kind of the fluidity you're seeing through the other primes, it really comes down to a couple of different things. One is, clearly, you have everybody understands what they're paying from an IRR perspective. But where the interpretation comes in is around the crowd. And then what you apply to the crowd in terms of overhead and fringe on top of that. And so that's where you're seeing the ranges across each of the different peer companies. And so we're going to work through in terms of what the cash payments will look like, and that's discussions that we're having internally right now. But I think what's more important if we were to take this back to a macro level, it's important that we continue to press on the real issue here, which is we need to get this repealed or we need to get it deferred. It is going to be a huge impact from an overall U.S. competitiveness perspective. And so ensuring that this gets delayed, it is important to continue to drive the innovation that we think about and keeping the U.S. at the cutting edge of innovation. Christopher Kubasik : Thanks, Michelle. And Michelle and I have spent a little bit of time with the tax department in her first week. And it's just a world-class organization. And when you look at the metrics, whether it's our effective tax rate relative to others, if you look at our R&D tax credit, which is not what we're talking about now relative to others and the percentages, I think we just got a great organization there and we're seeing that in our financial results.  So going to the talent question, which is a great question. Actually, in 2021, we hired 8,000 new people. And I talked about COVID earlier, and we opened the office and kind of got back to whatever the new norm was in December. And it was interesting because at that time, half of those employees, 4,000, have never even been to a L3Harris facility, with FedEx, on laptops and do everything via Zoom. So talking about a new -- kind of a new world here. But we've hired 8,000. We're probably going to hire another 8,000 this year. We're seeing a little bit of inflation or most of the inflation is at the entry level. We haven't really seen that at the higher levels or the executive levels yet. Maybe that comes later in 2022. But a lot of this depends on geography, and half our workforce seems to be in Florida and Texas. And those seem to be places that people enjoy living and working or moving to. So we've been a little more fortunate maybe just based on the geography. We get about 1,000 new college grads a year. We have a whole process as to how to recruit those through key schools, focused schools. And we've maintained our internship program the last 2 years, even during the pandemic. Unfortunately, those -- we're all remote. But I think I told you back in 2020, we extended offers, we honor those offers. All those things kind of contribute and pay off. And my goal and the team's goal is to have an engaged workforce that's excited to come to work every day and help with our mission. We do periodic engagement surveys to track that. So I think we're doing everything we can. A big believer in flexible work schedules. And we've got a whole variety of ways to have the workforce stay engaged and contribute. But clearly, a watch item. But so far, so good. I mentioned F-35 earlier and some of the challenges that, that program has had. We've been fortunate to have a highly engaged workforce holidays, weekends, over time and been able to maintain that staffing even through the pandemic and meet our milestones. So hopefully, that helps, Robert. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Michael Ciarmoli : Welcome, Michelle. Chris, I just wanted to go back, I think, to maybe Sheila's question on what really changed in SAS? And maybe even dovetailing in kind of programs that are being impacted by the continuing resolution. But I think you kind of called out the biggest, being the F-35. And it seems like that would have been a known sort of headwind, I guess, in October. So were there any other big specific programmatic changes or programs that you can't start up because of the continuing resolution that are weighing on that kind of growth rate? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, good question. No, I mean, the F-35 is a pretty program, right? So we follow the prime -- and as quantities and strategies change relative to what's going to be retrofitted and what's not and such, and I'm talking about all F-35, which we have crypto capabilities. We have displays. We have bomb racks and of course, TR3. So it's a broad portfolio of just under $1 billion of revenue. So it changes on a regular basis. I can assure you. But it's a fair point. We didn't have it at 150 last time we talked. But relative to the CR, it's probably won't be a satisfying question. It's not the fact that I think just the fact that we have a CR has caused the contracting organization and our customers just to defer and delay making awards. So -- which is kind of an indirect impact. I mean there are programs that have been awarded that the follow-on work is limited to the prior year dollars. The new work can't get started. So these aren't getting awarded. And we just see a huge backlog of things that just haven't been awarded. So a lot of these are in the space of the classified arena. And most of the space work is domestic. They don't have a big international footprint as an example. EWs and electronic warfare and mission avionics, again, most of those programs we're supporting an OEM. So we need them to go ahead and get their orders before putting us under contract. So it just feels like a big delay. I think as soon as we get a budget, as soon as there's more certainty, things will kind of open up and then the floodgates will open. But until now, we're probably erring on the side of conservatism. But like I said, based on the current conditions, we're standing by this guidance until things change for the better. And if and when that happens, we'll update you accordingly. Operator : Our final question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : Chris, I had a quick program question. I was wondering if you could update us on what the Navy and Air Force's plans are to replace the E6Bs, E4Bs? I think that was supposed to be a combined program at one point. I don't know where it is today, but I also know it's kind of right up IMS' alley in potentially a pretty big opportunity. So I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the timing and the sizing of that? And if that's something that DoD can actually fund? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Yes. No, it's right up our alley for the ISR IMS organization. But also those programs, as we do more and more cross-segment work involves BCS and some of the comms team as well. So the one thing I think we're doing a much better job on and what we've been doing since the merger is pulling in other sectors and other segments and looking at some of these things holistically. So yes, IMS will take the lead, but we'll be able to pull through. The E6Bs, I think that's one that we were hoping for last year, and it continues to slide. We'll have to follow up with you with the exact dollar opportunities. It's on our priority of pursuit list to get both of those programs. But I think it's a '22 program. But with all the things that I talked about, it could slip into '23. So -- we'll get you more information on that one, Pete. Christopher Kubasik : All right. Well, look, before we sign off, again, I want to welcome Michelle. Obviously, she's hit the ground running. I'd also like to acknowledge the dedication and hard work and perseverance of our 47,000 employees worldwide. We've continued to perform well in a constantly changing environment. They've had to deal with different work schedules, locations, vaccine mandates, all while navigating through a pretty large merger of equals. So -- at the end of the day, we have a great team here at L3Harris. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as our company enters the third year post merger. Look forward to meeting and talking with everyone over the next few months, introducing Michelle. And then we'll be back in April for our first quarter call. So thank you all for joining. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Today\u2019s call will be focused on questions-and-answers following brief opening remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may now begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. And as a reminder, at the start of the year, we began reporting our results in our realigned three-segment structure that shifts pension items to the corporate level. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for a few comments. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you saw, we released our results after the market closed yesterday in our new streamlined format. We're always looking at ways to improve and challenge the status quo. So instead of issuing a press release at 7 :30 this morning, and have Michelle and I read prepared remarks, which were very similar to the press release and maybe with some added color, and then having you follow along with our web charts, which are just a graphic depiction of what we were going to say anyway. We thought we'd try something new and come out with what we're calling our investor letter and putting everything in one document.  And that allows us all the time today to focus on the questions and talk about what's on your mind. So just real quickly, the first quarter results are consistent with our prior commentary of a back half 2022 weighted revenue and margin plan. This will also be the case with our free cash flow as well. And for the full year, we're reiterating our guide across the board as we continue to advance our strategy in a dynamic environment, whether it's from the pandemic or the global threats in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. So before opening the line to questions, I'd like to express our steadfast support the people of Ukraine. I think we all agree their unwavering strength and resilience are a motivating force behind our mission here at L3Harris. So with that, Rob, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Good morning. I wanted to ask you really a general question, to just elaborate on your Agile Development Group and the strategy behind the partnership with Shield Capital. Nut then something more specific on the flight test status for your integrated core processor for the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 and the possibility that delays on TR3 might push Block 4 out to fiscal '29 and how all this impacts the revenue back up that you previously talked about between TR2 and TR3? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Why don't I take F-35 first, and then I'll ask Michelle to give you some of the financial numbers on F-35, then I'll come back and do ADG and Shield. So yeah, we talk about F-35 each quarter appropriately so. And I'll say this last quarter is probably the best quarter we've had in a while. We're progressing through the integration and test, which we all know is the most challenging part of any development program. And the integrated core processor did begin safety of flight testing earlier in March. So that is a good sign and progressing well. I do want to highlight, we do also have the Panoramic Cockpit Display, which just completed its safety of flight. And then the Aircraft Memory System completed its full qualification test. So everything is tracking well to the first flight. We just provide this to Lockheed, and I think in 2023 is going to be the first flight of the aircraft. So all seems to be going well. On the contractual side, we secured a contract for ICP for Lot 16 and for AMS and PCD on Lot 16 and 17. So we're getting to production contracts, and we're going to be ready to hit the ground running as we complete these tests. So as you'd expect, we're investing R&D and capital to continue to support the program and find more efficient ways to meet these commitments. And I do want to recognize the team because we are working effectively three shifts and weekends. This is the highest priority for everyone. And we've had customer visits and they've been very complementary of the workforce and the progress that we're making.  So Michelle? Michelle Turner : Yeah. Good morning, Rob. So just to add a little bit of color from a financial perspective. So our overall Mission Avionics sector is going to be down mid-single digits, consistent with what we shared before. The F-35 development is going to be down low-double digits before we get into the ramp from a production perspective. So we anticipate going into next year that we'll be flattish to up a couple of percent. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. So let me go back to the first question about the Agile Development Group and our investment in Shield. So you've heard us talk about our strategy of being a trusted disruptor investing more in R&D as a percentage of revenue than most trying to prime more contracts and embracing the new entrants that are disrupting the marketplace and the DoD. So we set up the Agile Development Group. It is an entity that had previously existed. So some of this is just kind of branding it and giving it the recognition it deserves. We have a couple of thousand engineers in this group. Their R&D is double digits as a percentage of revenue. And they're really the front end of the business. And they've been working with speed and agility and innovation. Most of the focus has been on modular open systems, which has been embraced by our customer. And it's hard to give examples because a lot of what we're doing is in the classified arena, initially focused on the air domain. We're also doing some interesting development on new and creative weapon systems.  So they're the front end. And as we get these contracts out of development and into production, they'll hand these off to another entity who is world-class at producing them. So I don't think it's the most unique thing in the industry, but it's something we thought made sense. And they're off to a pretty good start I've spent a lot of time in D.C., and the customers have been excited about it. And have even come down and visited our facilities. Generally very impressed with how we're moving along. Now Shield Capital is a venture capital firm. They raised $125 million. We're the largest strategic partner. And the thought process there was trying to find a way to get these new startup technology companies, which I differentiate from small businesses. Small businesses as a compliance -- contractual compliance and usually applies to service contracts. These are mainly Silicon Valley high-tech startup companies who have great commercial technologies that want to support the Department of Defense. And it's hard for these companies to get programs of record. So we're embracing and working with them.  So we will make investments, either co-invest or through Shield in these companies, which is secondary to the goal of making this strategic investment in that to get this technology into our systems quicker, faster, more affordable and meet the war fighter need. So very excited about that. And we'll keep you updated as that progresses in the years ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Chris, Michelle and team. Thanks so much for the bold new efficient format. I like it. I think Slide 16 or Page 16 is my favorite though. So Chris, since the last time we spoke, there's been a lot of change. The budget came out. It was more robust of an outlook than we thought, coupled with NATO members stepping up defense spending. So given your ability to be perhaps more nimble than others, what are you seeing in terms of incremental opportunities? And how do you think that could impact the intermediate growth profile of LHX? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thanks, Sheila. We'll obviously welcome all feedback on the new investor letter, but I think we got a lot of positive feedback, giving you 15 hours to read it instead of one hour. So hopefully, that was helpful. Yeah, on Ukraine -- and I'll just say Ukraine in the whole region. The breaking news yesterday was you saw the White House asked Congress for an additional $33 billion of funding. And when you look into the details, which I know will evolve over time, $20 billion is for defense. And of that, $6 billion is the US AI, which is the Ukraine security assistance initiative and $6 billion is FMS.  And those are two vehicles and processes that we're very familiar with, and we've used over the last several years or decades in supporting Ukraine. So I think we understand how that process works, which, of course, is very important. The $6 billion compares to $300 million last year. So this is a significant increase, and we just need to see how long it's going to take to get this bill passed.  As we read it, it appears to have a lot more flexibility for acting quickly to get these contracts moving. So as you would imagine, we're in discussion with several customers in the region and here in the U.S. There's lots of opportunities for L3Harris. When you think of secured communications, I think it's been pretty well publicize the importance of having secured communications. And that's worked well.  With Ukraine, has been a longtime customer of ours. I think you can read and see that the Russians are having difficulty with the communication. So I think that positions us well. We have just, under the whole ISR, situational awareness, whether it's space ISR, air ISR, even the EO/IR turrets out of WESCAM are examples of things that I think could be needed and of course, night vision goggles. So we're really not able to give a lot of details, as you would imagine. But I think broadly, we're well situated. And many of these capabilities are in our sweet spot, even including EW electronic warfare. So I think over the midterm, we continue to believe low to mid-single digits is the right guide at this point in time. We are starting to get demand signals. We're responding to RFIs. But I do like the tailwinds. And I think more to come over the next several quarters. I will say relative to being more agile or nimbler, I can't give you the specifics, but I can tell you within 15 days from receiving a request, we were able to ship product to help with the conflict. And just so you know a lot of this is reprioritization, right? So we have other customers who are willing to give up their products, to get them over in the region. And then we have to obviously backfill those as well. So I don't know if that got to all your point, Sheila, but that's -- I think we're well situated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning Robert Stallard : Chris, I'd reiterate the -- thanks for this new format and the timing especially is very helpful. In terms of my question, inflation obviously is a big issue across the world at the moment. And in relation to defense, there's obviously been some concern about how this could flow through on fixed price contracts. So I was wondering if you could comment on that and what sort of alleviation L3Harris might have to this issue. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you. No, inflation is a challenge for all of us, and I think all industries. And I think a lot of people immediately jumped to the traditional supply chain and materials, which obviously gets the attention, but I also believe and we're planning for wage and labor inflation as well as the job market gets tighter. So I think we look at it more broadly. When I look at our backlog and our portfolio, we have about 25% of our contracts are cost-plus cost reimbursable. So the way those are designed, the added cost to flow through to our end user. And I think that's one of the reasons you see the budget increased, although I don't think anyone believes it's large enough to absorb all the inflationary headwinds. We have about 25% of our business through the -- not only commercial products, but the commercial business model that we've talked about, whether it's our WESCAM turrets or TACOM radios and such. So similar to other industries at the right time, you increase your prices to take that on. So the real risk if you will, is the 50% that's firm fixed price.  As you know, we don't have a lot of multiyear backlog, but we do have a little over 12 months of backlog. So in that case, it is a headwind.  So in a lot of those contracts, there's escalation clauses. The reality is those indices are probably less than the real inflation, but that does absorb some of headwind. We've talked about E3 and some of the initiatives we're taking there. We've doubled down on that effort, and are going to have to continue to find ways to be more efficient. We're really embracing and rolling out digital engineering. We're investing in more machinery and tooling to be more efficient. So that's going to be the challenge. And then on new bids, which we do several. Michelle and I seems like every day are reviewing another proposal. We have to build those costs into the bids going forward, obviously.  So that's how we address it. And it's given us a little bit of headwind as you see here in the quarter. I don't know, Michelle, if you want to maybe quantify it? Michelle Turner : Yeah. So I would just characterize it's very consistent with what we shared in our previous guidance. And the other thing I would say is that from a 2022 perspective, we've locked in most of our supply pricing. So we've mitigated most of the risk consistent with what we put into the guidance. Although I will say that this environment is becoming more elongated. So as we're thinking about our strategic planning, this is certainly going to be a headwind as we think about 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Good morning, guys. And thank you for the very efficient format both last night and on your opening comments. I had a couple of questions related to one another. So a, if you could just broadly characterize kind of how LHX fared in the fit-up forecast? An open-ended question, if you could talk about radios? You've won a number of IDIQs, night vision, what have you. So take it as far as you'd like, but talk to us about the fit-up and how you guys are positioned? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Did you have more? Or just -- is that your only question? Gautam Khanna : Meaning the lives and other questions as well. We can defer that. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Yeah. I mean, as we saw -- the good news is we did get a '22 budget finally. We've talked at length of challenges. It's taken 165 days to get a budget. But nonetheless, we do get a budget. Now we're starting to see some contracts and activity pick up at a quicker pace. For '23, I think we've all seen just focused on the top-line, the $773 billion top line. In my discussions with several customers and members of Congress, I believe that number is actually going to go up during the conferencing process. I think we've seen about $20 billion on the UP list, the Unfunded Priority list. And I think the majority of that is going to be ultimately rolled into the final 2023 budget. Relative to -- I'll just go to the Unfunded Priority list first. You did mention night vision. That was in the budget as zero. It was zeroed out. But ourselves and our competitor are aggressively working the hill to get that funding back in, with the concurrence of the army. We generally don't go to the hill without our customers' support. So the fact that, that's on the UP list, I think is a positive. So that was probably the one thing that caught our eye on the negative side. But on the positive side, I'll let Michelle talk a little bit about the IDIQ. Everything we looked at seemed to align well with what we wanted. I mean, we track all of our current programs, but we also look at new opportunities. We're very aggressive in bidding opening the aperture and looking for new opportunities. And we like to make sure those opportunities are funded, even though they're competitive, because over the long run, we think we're well positioned to win some of those. The only thing I'd just also throw out beyond DoD is NOAA. I mentioned that we're well positioned with the next-gen weather satellites. The NOAA budget went up 17% \u201823 over \u201822. NASA is up 8%. Even the FAA, where we do a lot of work, is up 4%. So when I look at DoD, Noah, NASA, FAA, and then I think we've all been following the international budgets are trending up, especially in the NATO countries.  I just see this as a lot of positive tailwinds that put us in a good position to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. But maybe I'll give it to Michelle to give a little more color. Michelle Turner : Yeah. No, I agree. I think often in recent discussions, our radio business has been overshadowed by our supply chain challenges. But when you look at the predictive indicators, whether we're talking about the budgets with double-digit growth on our handheld or the IDIQs that we received within first quarter. $10 billion of IDIQ is really speak to a predictive indicator on the overall growth within this business. And so we're excited about the near term. Going back to Sheila's question around the immediate opportunities that we're getting from the conflict environment as well, all of the macro indicators would suggest that we're going to have a tailwind related to this business. So we're excited about what's to come. We do need to get through the hurdle, however, with the immediate supply chain challenges Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yeah. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. And thanks for your time. And I appreciate the new format like everyone else. I think it's really efficient. Chris, I guess my question is just leaving off from what Michelle just mentioned on the supply chain. Just your comfort level around kind of things improving in the second half? And then also just how it relates to maybe you take a more cautious approach and carry more inventory as we kind of look towards this kind of building budget environment and just kind of have an adjusting case supply versus kind of targeting your working capital days that you been highly focused on? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yeah, thanks. No, that's a great question. Clearly, that's the number one risk that we're all following and have been talking about for at least the last nine months and maybe longer. But to put it in perspective, from last time we had a conversation, I would say it's about the same. It feels like we're making progress. Every day is different. We get two steps forward, one step back. I think the only thing that's changed in my mind maybe the length of the recovery. There's a belief that this was going to all be behind us in 2022. I think it's going to go into 2023.  And again, when I look at supply chain, I put it in three buckets, we have inflation, we have materials and we have labor. I think I've covered the inflation in the prior question. But again, we're kind of in the mid to high-single digit rates, depending on which index you're looking at. And we know it's going to come back down to lower single digits. But I'm thinking that 2023 where previously people might have projected fourth quarter of this year. The materials is mainly the electronic components. We've talked about our investments in a variety of tools, data analytics. And those processes are paying off as we get better visibility. But at the end of the day, the lead times continue to extend, and even the freight and shipping challenges are adding to the complexity, just getting the products into the country and of course, the increased cost of just shipping everything. And labor -- the labor shortage, I think the attrition is up pretty much across our industry. And that's something we've got to figure out how to address. But I think the labor shortage is even more significant within the supply chain. So therein lies the challenge. We've been very successful in our new college grad recruiting. So that's working well from our perspective.  But I'd say feel about same as I did 90 days ago, just a little longer recovery is the way I think I would I would summarize it. I don't know, Michelle, if there's more? Michelle Turner : Yeah. So I can add a little bit from a numbers perspective. But I do just because of the complements that we received on the investor letter, I do want to thank Rajeev and the IR team, along with our controller team, communications and legal, a lot of collaborative effort went into creating this. And we feel like it's really a win on many levels. But the one that I would highlight for this group is really how we're living into our DNA of being a trusted disruptor across the organization. So it's not just about our products and technologies, it's about how each and every one of us show up differently to ensure we're a differentiator. So on the supply chain front, just to put some context from a numbers perspective, in first quarter, we expect this is going to be slightly under $100 million in terms of the top-line impact. We expect that that's going to be fairly consistent in Q2, with the recovery happening in the second half and into 2023. And so to Chris' point, I think it's very consistent with what we -- where we were at in January, except with a potential elongation into 2023 as well.  But I do think it's also really important going back to the budget conversation to note that this is all about timing, in particular within tactical radios. The demand for our products remained very strong. So it's really about getting through this short-term lift from a supply chain perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to continue on the tactical radio side. Because when I think of the products that you've got here, I mean, this is sort of the -- I think of it kind of post-jitter's world where you're trying to have common waveforms. So you need a lot of interoperability. So it means you have to -- and my sense is it means you have to really outfit large portions of the military.  And when you think about the IDIQs you've gotten, can you talk about how those -- how you expect those to play out in terms of, in a sense, completing the deployment over time of the radios that the Army, the Marines that they need overtime?  And then second, how do you think about the conversion of those IDIQs into revenues in terms of your share, in terms of the timing of individual awards? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. No, Doug, great question. Yes. So we can -- let me take the first part, maybe at a higher level, and Michelle can give you some of the actual numbers that show you what we're doing relative to orders and revenue kind of quarter-by-quarter and the outlook So no, look, you're absolutely right on the importance of these radios and the resilient communications. A lot of our R&D goes into new waveforms.  And as we've said before, the modernization is still in the early phases. So we talk about the SOCOM two-channel multiband handheld. That's an almost $400 million IDIQ. It's a little over halfway utilized, which still means there's a couple of hundred million dollars of opportunity. And SOCOM is a great customer, and a lot of our radios start there and then migrate into the other services and even internationally. That was the handheld. They also -- we also have a single -- these are both single awards, which means we get obviously up to the IDIQ ceiling limit, $550 million, for the Manpack. And again, that's about halfway through the spend. So clearly, lots of opportunities in SOCOM. It's 100% LHX. When we go into the -- some of the tactical radios for the Marine, we had a two-channel handheld opportunity there. That was competitive, winner take all. Again, single award, $750 million. That we want. And that's really just getting started. We've had tens of millions of dollars on that so far. I think the ones you read more about and hear about are the dual awards. So if you look at the army rifleman, that's one where we're one of two. And same with the manpack, and again, those were just awarded recently in a recompetition. But those ceiling limits go over a decade, just shy of $4 billion and $12.7 billion.  So the -- step one, as you know, is to win the IDIQ, kind of call that the hunting license. And then you go task order by task order year by year. So we're in really good position. And the modernization will continue secured comps and situational awareness are two key things you need in any conflict. Before handing to Michelle, I will point out, notwithstanding some of the headwinds and volatility in our tactical comm revenue. We still have not missed a customer delivery. So the team is doing a great job every day, different parts come in, get deferred, make sure a challenge. I will point out, we did increase our inventory about $30 million just in TACOM as we are trying to get more and more of the electronic components in sooner rather than later. But as you know, the lead times are now 6 to 12 months, much more than they used to be. So Michelle, you want to give more color? Michelle Turner : Yeah. And just to put some context around the inventory builds. We did build inventory across the enterprise by about $100 million, what we call smart inventory, in terms of solidifying the second half revenue growth. So I think that's a good callout, Chris. But on the IDIQs, we did have 4 substantial IDIQs from outland radio perspective within first quarter. The first one, a $6 billion 10-year dual source IDIQ. So to Chris' point, based on history and how that plays out, we would expect to get half of that in terms of as the funding comes in.  And just a reminder, in terms of how we do our backlog? Our backlog does not assume these IDIQs until they're funded. And so part of what we saw play out within Q1 on the book-to-bill being right around one, did not include any of the funding upside that we would anticipate as we add -- as funding is added to these IDIQs. And then just a couple of other notes. We did book a $3.7 billion from a five-year navy multiservice. This is a sole-source IDIQ. So that would be 100% coming to L3Harris. Similarly, a $750 million 10-year award with Marine Corps. That was a competitive award. And then the final one was a $300 million SOCOM award, another sole source. So of the 4 booked, all were sole sourced, except for the first one, which was dual-source. So again, continue to have really strong predictive indicators in terms of our demand for radios. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Chris, Michelle. Good morning. So I wanted to ask you, you've been talking about the bookings. Book-to-bill was about one in the quarter. Your comments about continuing to grow. It just seems an understatement to say you're optimistic about demand, given the global increases in defense spending and the upward trajectory of new awards. So what does it say about book-to-bill for the -- how book-to-bill for '22 ends up? I mean, are we talking about an improving outlook here? Do you see international as a bigger driver of your bookings now? And I guess if you could offer a comment on maybe how you're thinking about now what '23 bookings might look like? Anything you could offer there, I think, would be helpful. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, good morning. Richard, it's always good to hear from you. Yeah. We -- the first quarter was 0.98 book-to-bill, and that's really funded book-to-bill as Michelle explained. So maybe a little more conservative than the way others look at it. Look, we've got a plan of about 105 book-to-bill. So we're looking at being over 1 each of the next three quarters. We might be a tad on the conservative side, but we did have a CR through mid-March. And now we have to actually convert these into actual contracts. So that's the process we're going through. I see international as a tailwind as well. We have some great opportunities for international ISR. We have our EO/IR turrets. And we just have to go through the process. We have congressional notifications and dealing with foreign governments and their approval process. So we think we're in a good position. A lot of these are sole sourced that we're just going through the contracting and export and approval process. And I would expect those to close as planned.  So hopefully, over in the 105 range for this year. We haven't given a lot of insight into '23, but we kind of use that as probably a benchmark for '23 as well because I keep -- we keep talking about the tailwinds each and every day. There's -- everything seems to be positive relative to the demand signals that we're getting. We just have to win and then move forward. In fact, we we're going to be announcing, but the navy announced something that we're quite excited about. That was a recent award known as Spear, which is the shipboard panoramic electro optical infrared system. And why I want to bring this up is it aligns perfectly with our strategy, which is to invest upfront in R&D, prime, more opportunities and then embrace new entrants or flip the paradigm and have some of the more legacy primes on our team. So we'll get a press release out on this one shortly, but it's $200 million EMD opportunity and just under $600 million with options. And that's just for 21 ships for the U.S. Navy. We believe it could be upwards of 100 ships. And of course, we have the international market. So it's a competitive win. We started this actually six years ago by investing our IR&D or R&D on passive target different businesses within L3Harris working together collaboratively. This is a multibillion-dollar opportunity that we're really excited about. And it provides 360 EOIR passive detection and tracking, which is what our Navy needs. If you want to put it under the JAV [ph] C2 umbrella or whatever, this is a big deal. It's modular, it's open systems, and it's something you'll see more in the days ahead.  And then we're waiting for award on something called Spectral with the navy, which is the next-gen sign information operations and the electronic attack solutions. So all these things -- and that has at least four bidders, but we're going after these things. And it aligns with our strategy, and these will start to give us more tailwind and confidence in our growth profile. Michelle Turner : Yeah. And just to add a couple of additional words to that because this is part of our second half growth. We are anticipating international ISR missionization programs in the second half as well. And so specifically to the question on international, we did land within Q1 with a book-to-bill over 1 is 1.08 from an international perspective with 4% growth. And so I think that speaks to the -- another predictive indicator in terms of our strategy is working. And then on the space side, clearly continues to be a growth engine for us. We are anticipating the announcement of award on SCCA tracking Tranche 1 as well. And so that's another competitive award that we're anticipating in the second half of the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Good morning, Chris, Michelle. Mix, I wanted to touch on it. I think it was -- it sounds like it was a benefit to IMS in the quarter, but a negative on SAS. And I think for the full year, it's supposed to be a headwind to both of those segments. So if you could just touch on kind of the big moving pieces when we think about the mix and the impact on margins?  And could you also just touch on the size within -- I think it's within IMS now? Commercial aviation, how big that business actually is now given you've sold off a decent chunk of it? And where that, I guess, that stands relative to like-for-like pre-pandemic levels? Thanks. Michelle Turner : Yeah. David so I'll start, and then Chris can jump in. From an overall mix perspective, to your point, our segment margins came in at 16%. You'll know that our guide is 16% to 16.25%. So we came in on the low end of that. But to your point, there was certainly some mix variation when you looked across our segments. So I'll start with IMS. They had a really strong quarter, landing at 14.8%, and comparative to our guide of 13.5 to 13.75, really strong execution. So big complement to look at our ISR team but also overall program mix within our commercial aviation business.  So compliments to Alan and his team as well. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth within our commercial aviation sector, and we're expecting that to continue to grow in the second half as well. And so really strong EAC performance. We do expect that to modulate a bit as we get into second half to align with the guide that we provided. And then to your point, the opposite dynamic is actually playing out within SAS. So we landed Q1 at 11.9 versus a guide of 12.5 to 12.75, which implies that there is going to be increased expectations from a productivity perspective and mix.  Now we did have a really strong quarter from a space perspective within SAS. That's a lower-margin business for us with a lot of the new program wins within it. So we expect that, coupled with our E3 savings, to help that business in the second half of the year. And then finally, from a CS perspective, we talked a lot about supply chain today, but that was clearly a headwind within Q1. We do expect with the volume recovery in the second half that they're going to be able to get to the overall guide of 24.25% to 24.50%. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. And just to -- on the Commercial Aviation, we're right about $500 million of revenue this year is the outlook, pre-pandemic that was in the $900 million range for our commercial training business. So we're continuing to be patient and take advantage of the rebound, which should be coming soon. We had previously divested the military training, so 900 to 500 there. And I'll just foot stomp, the space business is really doing well, well over $2 billion of revenue, double-digit growth. And I just think we're in the sweet spot, whether it's prime in these responsive space opportunities, such as SDA and HBTSS that we've talked about, some classified opportunities, GPS and the MTS3, which is the next generation of GPS, the weather satellites I mentioned, but also the exquisite satellites, where we are a sub to other companies and provide our payload.  So we're going to take this work each and every time. Might be a little headwind on the margins, but it positions us long term for growth and follow-on opportunities. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking question. Love the new format. Chris, just -- and maybe, Michelle, back to the international in the demand environment. I guess if we look at the growth trajectory really in the industry prewar, it was really going to be driven by U.S. DoD modernization next-generation programs in this R&D phase shifting to production. But I guess given what we're seeing with NATO and the increases in their spending plans as a percent of GDP, are you guys seeing more tangible evidence?  And you pointed out that 1.08 book-to-bill that there could be an increase for higher-margin legacy systems as you go forward. And that could potentially provide some structural margin tailwinds as you move into kind of this medium term if these European NATO countries really need to recapitalize their business or their industrial base rather? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Michael, that's a great question on the legacy systems. I think we're all learning if the system is out of production now, I think it's almost impossible to restart some of these weapon systems that you read and hear about having been in production for a decade.  So being able to restart something, I think, is difficult. It's something that's currently operational, but maybe an older version or something, I think those are going to be easier to deploy. Again, with the supply chain headwind, I think that is going to be the challenge. I don't think anyone in the industry has a lot of these products lying around in their warehouses. We look for demand signals and contracts.  Now what we're seeing is the customer who's been depleting their inventory. So we're more in a restocking situation. So look, I'm real optimistic about our international opportunities. I think we are unique relative to other companies because we have a combination of products and we use a global distribution network. And then we have our more traditional business development staff with in country executives, in-focused countries, about 10 focus countries. We're focused where we think these opportunities for growth are. So I'm increasingly optimistic about what we've done in international. It's a larger percentage of our company each and every quarter. I think this quarter, maybe in the 23% range.  So more to come. And now that COVID is easing, a lot of us are going to be traveling around the globe more and more to continue to build these relationships and try to close deals. So with that, let me just say, first of all, I appreciate the feedback on our new format. So I think we're going to do this again and continue to do it, at least for the rest of the year and see if we can come up with something even more creative. I know our customers are under a lot of stress, and we're all working in the industry to support our customers.  I mentioned the Agile Development Group and Shield, but this is a result of listening to our customer and hearing what they want and then taking action. So a lot of this, I have to credit our customers for saying they want new entrants. They want innovation. They want to work with Silicon Valley type companies. So we're trying to adapt to that.  And of course, I have to thank the employees, the dedication, the hard work, the innovative spirit. It's all inspiring. I feel like we've got a lot of momentum, a lot of excitement and really looking forward to wrapping up a solid 2022. I will just say in closing that we'll continue our humanitarian efforts for the people Ukraine. We'll keep working with DoD, NATO allies and others to support this mission and deal with the conflict at hand. So thank you for joining the call, and we'll wrap up a little earlier than normal. Have a great weekend. And talk to you in a couple of months. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market closed yesterday, a streamlined format that we're pleased to continue, given the positive feedback. So today's call will be focused primarily on answering your questions. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.  Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you for some brief comments. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'm encouraged by our progress as we continue to execute our trusted disruptor strategy. We're investing in targeted capabilities in and outside of the company, and we've had over $1 billion of notable prime awards this month alone. And we're pursuing international expansion as our customers need mission-critical solutions in a rapidly changing threat environment.  We're also encouraged by how budgets are shaping up globally. The threats are evident, and there's growing urgency to support defense spending in the U.S., NATO and elsewhere. This is a stark contrast to a couple of years ago, where budgets were expected to be flat at best.  Our book-to-bill of 1.14x in the quarter supports this shift in the budget environment. At the same time, there are factors outside of our control, such as supply chain, inflation and labor markets tightening that are offsetting and masking our progress as well as the opportunities ahead. Our results, however, highlight that we're working to mitigate these challenges.  Our second quarter results are consistent with prior commentary of a back half weighted year for revenues, margins and cash. Nonetheless, we kept EPS relatively stable year-over-year and our free cash flow stepped back from breakeven last quarter to more than $700 million.  In addition, while we're reiterating our guide, we're now pointing to the low end of the range across the board. Based on the timing of some key awards, including protest activity and a prolonged supply chain recovery, we decided to take a more measured approach, especially given the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that are somewhat unpredictable. So despite the noise, we continue to execute on our strategy.  With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. Operator : . Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : Chris, can you give us a lay of the land on F-35 and Tech Refresh 3? And whether you still see about $150 million headwind there this year before beginning to recover in '23? And then bigger picture, the investor letter did a great job of highlighting the budget upside that came through in '22 and the plus ups could look likely in '23.  When do you think that really begin to materialize for the industry in terms of seeing it come through in terms of the numbers? And how do you think your strategy positions you to capture that upside relative to your peers? Christopher Kubasik : All right. Thanks, David. I think there were about three questions in there. Let me see if I can get them. Let me start with F-35.  Usually, I give a long answer and list all the components that we're involved with, but it really comes down to the ICP, the integrated core processor.  So today, I think I'm going to give you a shorter answer because we actually completed the safety of flight certification, and the first flight systems were delivered to Lockheed Martin last month. So great news relative to TR3 and meeting that delivery, a little late, but nonetheless, it's progressing.  So our last 15 hardware starts getting delivered later this year, and the whole focus here is to support Lockheed to enable their 2023 aircraft delivery. So feeling much better about the progress the team has made. I know they worked a lot of long nights and weekends to get here. So I appreciate that effort. And your financial numbers remain accurate, based on what we've told you before.  Relative to the strategy, I think it's working. We've talked about this trusted disruptor strategy with more innovation, more prime and more international. So when I look at the innovation, this quarter, we made a small investment in a free space optic company called Minarik.  We've had a handful of investments with Shield through our venture capital. And we continue to spend a fair amount in high R&D to position us for new wins.  The goal to prime more has been great last year with an earlier this year, significant wins in ISR and MUSV, HBTSS. And of course, we've been winning a majority of the share on the radio modernization program.  I mentioned, so far this year, SDA tracking Tranche 1 was a big win. And here in the month of July, we were also awarded CEC, which is a Cooperative Engagement Capability, really a pillar of the JADC2 initiative for the Navy, which I'm quite excited about.  And another program we're priming called EAGL, which is the Expeditionary Advanced Ground Link, again, tied to free space optics. So pretty excited there. And then internationally, at a high level, we've had mid-single-digit growth the past couple of years. Our book-to-bill has always been over 1.0x. And I think the ability to have these focused countries and put the resources where we think the opportunities are makes a lot of sense.  And just last month, we added Poland and Italy to our focus country program, given the opportunities over in Europe. As far as when we're going to see it. I think it's just a matter of getting the '23 budget. We've been tracking the markups. We're very excited to see that our programs are supported. The opportunities we're chasing are supported.  So whether the base budget or the markup, we're very well positioned, including some of the news coming out of the Senate earlier this week. So we basically need a budget. So I think everybody thinks there'll be a CR. So I'm guessing '23, when the awards are made, we'll start to see industry and L3Harris benefit. Operator : The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : I'm going to try to follow the rules. Just a follow-up on David's question for SAS. The top line is accelerating to mid-single-digit growth from low single-digit decline in the first half.  Can you talk about the drivers of that improvement? How much is coming from the space business accelerating versus better avionics and EW volumes? And how do you think about the growth going forward, given some of the progress on F-35? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, I'll take the first shot, and then maybe ask Michelle to give a little more color on the sector. But space is clearly our fastest-growing sector in the company. This win that we had earlier this month for SDA tracking Tranche 1 is just a huge opportunity. If you recall, we won Tranche 0 for 4 satellites. This is 14 satellites. Pretty excited about this particular win. And again, it's an example where we're priming. We have the payload capabilities, and that's ultimately where the value resides. So as a reminder, $700 million award, 14 satellites, and it really ties into our responsive satellite strategy. A couple of years ago, it was nonexistent. Now we have satellites in low earth orbit, medium earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit. So it's really going well.  I think at the date of the merger, we had no business with the Missile Defense Agency. Now we're smack in the middle of that growing business line. So I'm really pleased with where we are. I think the other day, Michelle and I were looking, we have about a $20 billion pipeline in space alone.  And when you look at our capabilities in missile defense, weather, like I mentioned, all orbits and even ground capabilities, it's quite exciting.  But Michelle, you want to talk about the rest of the sector? Michelle Turner : Yes. No. You did a nice summary in space in terms of high to mid-single digits in terms of growth. From a Mission Avionics perspective, this is the ramp that we talked about on F-35. So as we head into production, you'll see that come in the second half.  And then also, Chris didn't mention it, but Intel and Cyber, right? Our classified business is continuing to grow as well, and we'll expect to see that ramp in the second half as well. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Elizabeth on for Ron. Can you give some color on what you're seeing on the chip side of the supply chain and whether you're seeing an easing there? Or any sort of color you might be able to provide would be great. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Let me start. Just at a high level, I think at least at L3Harris, I think the whole industry has now realized there's a new norm in supply chain. And we're adapting to that as quickly as we can.  In the past, the whole focus was just-in-time inventory, inventory reductions, single sources. And you'd always go with the low-cost bidder without serious consideration on the certainty of supply and delivery.  So we have multiple work streams going in parallel. And I think we're doing a pretty good job in the short term, trying to mitigate and avoid the disruptions, but we're also looking how we revamp our supply chain resiliency for the long term.  So I've mentioned in the past, we've invested in tools to get end-to-end visibility beyond Tier 1. We're investing in critical materials, smart inventory, safety stock, which I understand builds our inventory balance. You'll see that on our balance sheet, but I think it's the right business decision.  And we're trying to move to more localized and distributed production to shorten the whole supply chain network to get our parts even quicker. And then we're looking at multiple sources for every part. So a complete turnaround, almost a 180, from where we were 3 years ago. But this is the new norm, in our opinion. This is what we're doing. Michelle, do you want to talk a little bit about the headwinds in the recovery? Michelle Turner : Yes. So just to frame it a little bit in terms of the numbers. To Chris' point, what's the same, right? So coming into the year, we anticipated that we would see a first half impact, particularly within electronic components. We are seeing that play out in terms of our first half results.  Additionally, we also talked about seeing sequential quarter-over-year improvement. We are seeing that from Q4 into Q1, additionally from Q1 into Q2. Albeit it is more modest than what we originally anticipated in our original guide back in January.  So when you look at our guidance update, pointing to the low end of the range, part of that is, to Chris' point, this elongation of the supply chain impacts that we're seeing out of '22 and into 2023.  I'd also highlight the risk mitigations that Chris talked about, in particular in terms of how those are working. We've been talking for 6 months about moving away from sole-source suppliers along with redesigning parts. We're continuing to work those activities. Many of those start to come online in the second half.  And so that is part of where we're getting some of our confidence in terms of the recovery in second half with the results of those actions starting to take effect. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Richard Safran : So I thought you might comment on the SOCOM Armed Overwatch program, where you're competing with Textron. And also, could you talk a bit more about the improvement you mentioned in commercial aviation? I'm interested in what the back half growth outlook might be for that business. And if you think the momentum continues into 2023? Christopher Kubasik : Right, Rich, let me take Armed Overwatch, and Michelle will talk to you about aviation. So yes, this is a program that goes back into late '19 and early 2020. And we decided to take a clean sheet approach to this program to align with the requirements.  Team has spent a fair amount of money in R&D and capital. We've had lots of demos that have gone well that we think position us in a good place to potentially win this program. It's for 75 aircraft. It's clearly a couple of billion dollar opportunity here domestically and even more, internationally. There's a lot of need for this type of capability in countries that are fighting terrorism.  We've had discussions with countries in Africa, the Middle East. I think, it is where the initial potential is, whether it's border protection or maritime operations, light strike, ISR, pretty flexible, pretty affordable program. So we kind of have to wait and see. Hopefully, something comes out in the next week or 2. And I think it's a key one to watch, in my opinion. I know it's important to our company, and it really would validate our strategy and the thesis for the merger because we invested in the innovation.  We started with a clean sheet. It's another opportunity to be a prime integrator, it has international potential. And it also has pull-through of our products, Wescam turrets, radios, weapon carriages and EW capabilities.  So we'll see what happens. I'm pretty excited about it. And maybe with that, we'll go to Michelle. Michelle Turner : Yes. And I would just add to the Armed Overwatch in terms of second half ramp. When you look at our overall ISR business, this is part of our expectations in terms of growth, particularly around these aircraft missionization.  We didn't have those in the first half. So we're chasing 3 to 5 programs here, this is one of them. And so to Chris' point, we're excited about seeing this come online and hearing about a potential win.  Back to the question on the commercial aviation. So we are continuing to see recovery. This will be our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The first half of the year, our overall commercial businesses, which also includes our Public Safety, was up double digits. And we anticipate that, that's going to continue through the end of 2022. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Chris, circling back a little bit to David's question on the budget. So 40% of L3's international revenues are in Europe. And I guess your total international book-to-bill has been averaging around 1 or above 1 in the past 12 months. I guess specifically, what do you see kind of playing out for L3 in Europe? I mean, should we expect bookings to accelerate in '23? Any kind of color there, just given all the budget actions and the Ukraine activity? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Peter. Clearly, we have opportunities in Europe. We've talked about some ISR capabilities that we've been -- we've already won in the past, where we continue to add aircraft, and we have a path to get to 8 aircraft for this particular country.  Clearly, with Ukraine, I think we have a core competency and a lot of experience working with the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the USAI money, that's always been in the budget. So clearly, the radios, the night vision goggles, even some ISR capabilities, position us well there.  And as I mentioned, we're going to open offices in Europe, the NATO countries. Poland is a big opportunity, where we've submitted a few a few bids, again, with comms, resilient comms, SATCOM, at a high level. That's where I see us making the most progress in the near term and even impacting our 2022 financials favorably and expect it to continue into '23. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : I wanted to try to understand what's going on in Tactical Communications a little bit better. You've had a rising backlog, but at the same time you've been constrained with supply chain issues.  And what I wanted to get is to understand once -- first, once the supply chain constraints ease up, what kind of trajectory do you expect to see as radios are delivered, a big surge or more of a long-term better growth outlook?  And then along with that, we've seen you keep your margins. Margins have held pretty well, even though we've got a lot of inflation exposure and you've got the supply chain issues. I mean, how do you see the risks around margin there as you go forward, if we see persistent inflation? Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Thanks. Let me make a few points, and then Michelle will give you the numbers. I mean, you're absolutely right. There's high demand for our radios, and I think that's one thing that the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted, the importance of resilient comms. So we have opportunities in Australia, 300 million for what's called Deltic Phase 2 with the Australian Defense Force. That's over 6,000 radios. We should hear on that maybe in the next month or 2.  We've talked about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the radios there. The first 4,000 or so cleared congressional notification. And in August, we're going to have our first article acceptance up in Rochester, and they've ordered a couple of thousand more. So that's going through the congressional notification process.  In the U.K., the Morpheus program, again, $100 million award approximately. So all those things are building the backlog, as you say. I will highlight that I think it was last year, we knew there was a supply chain shortage and we'd have to serve. So we invested in the capacity. So we now have more capacity. Michelle will give you the numbers, but we can clearly do better and grow without any constraints.  Last year, we had about 20 suppliers on our red list, and now we're down to 5 that we're watching carefully. And obviously, we need all the parts, but that's been pretty helpful.  The last thing I'll mention before giving to Michelle, I've talked in the past how we reengineer and redesign our products or our components, based on availability. And just this week, I was looking at our data, we've actually redesigned over 1,000 component parts in our products, whether it's radios, night vision goggles, WESCAM balls to be able to make these commitments and continue to deliver our products. So I'm pretty proud of our engineering team and how they've been able to adapt.  So that's kind of at a high level. Michelle, you want to talk about the capacity and the ramp capability? Michelle Turner : Yes. So Doug, so just to your point, in the first half, we did -- consistent with our expectations, we did see our Tactical Communications down low double digits, really driven by the electronic component constraints. As we go into second half, we expect that, that's going to grow in the high double digits. So to your point, we expect that, that starts to ease from a capacity perspective. We've made the investments that Chris talked about and continuing to see the electronic components improve. It's going to be critical for the second half and as we go into 2023.  We do have an elevated backlog, to your point. It's about 1.5 billion. So we have a healthy backlog that we'll be looking at as we go into 2023. And additionally, I'd note to the international question, the international book-to-bill within Tactical Communcations is 1.15 within the quarter. And so this really speaks to the overall conflict environment, Ukraine opportunities that we're seeing.  And we expect that, that will be a benefit for us as we go into 2023, but a lot of these orders are also being considered over a couple of years. And so you should think about it in terms of 2023, 2024 and into 2025. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Robert Stallard : Chris, I was wondering if you could comment on this NSO situation and what happened there? And in conjunction with that, whether you have any additional M&A deals potentially in the pipeline? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. I would say, clearly, relative to our M&A pipeline, we're looking at opportunities all the time, looking for game-changing solutions that are going to help us with our customers.  So yes, we're looking at a handful. We continue to look at M&A on a regular basis. We're also watching the regulatory environment and seeing what could potentially be approved and any potential overlap or antitrust issues.  So I'd say, we have a healthy process. We look at things all the time, and I don't see us in a position to announce anything in the next quarter or 2, but we'll continue to look.  Relative to NSO, we're fully aligned with the U.S. national security leadership on this matter. And I think all the reporting out there made it clear that no deal is going to happen, at least with us. So maybe someone else is talking to them, but not me. So I hope that helps. Operator : The next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : Chris, something you're probably super frustrated about, but this next-gen jammer, low-band ongoing protest. Can you give us any sense of -- for key dates or milestones in terms of kind of getting that resolved? I know it's dragged on probably way longer than anyone expected. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Yes. Well, Pete, I don't really get frustrated about much, but this has taken a longer time than anybody wanted. So there's going to be a re-procurement between us and Northrop. We all signed an agreement as to a path forward. So I expect to get into RFP in the next month or 2. We'll update our proposal.  And I would think, in mid-2023, hopefully earlier, 2023, that maybe we'll make a selection and we'll move on. It's really about the capabilities that the Navy needs and the threats that we keep talking about.  And we'll -- we respect the process to allow people to protest, and I think there's been 4 or 5 different judges and reviews and such, but it's progressing. So it was over $100 million of revenue we had in our plan for this year.  So that's kind of given us a little headwind. We'll move it into '23. The team is ready to go. We like our technology. We like our solution, and we'll wait for the Navy to select us again, hopefully. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the back half as you see it now, relative to the prior guide? The acceleration in organic revenue growth to mid-single, how much of that's 3Q versus 4Q? How much visibility you have versus things that could slide? And then if there's anything on the cash flow side in terms of payment timing that you're looking at as well? Michelle Turner : Yes, I'll jump in, and then Chris, you can feel free to complement. So in the second half, to your point, in terms of the drivers, it's really 3 components. One is around supply chain recovery. And so as I noted earlier, we had an assumption that we'd have a pretty healthy hockey stick going into the back half of the year.  As we're seeing the supply chain environment elongate into 2023, we've mitigated that a bit in terms of the change in the guide to the lower end of the range, although we still do have a hockey stick going into the second half.  I will note, though, that as we're sitting here in Q3, we have similar challenges to what we had in Q1 and Q2. And so the risk profile is very consistent to what we delivered on in the first half.  The second is around new program wins. Chris mentioned SDA, along with SPEIR. These are 2 new awards that we've already won. And so the back half, we will be accelerating as those programs come online. And then the third piece is around our ISR missionization programs. We talked about Armed Overwatch. There are a number of other ISR missionization programs that we are pursuing. We expect those awards to happen within Q3, with a ramp happening in Q4.  And Noah, to your point, between Q3 and Q4, I would say, it's fairly consistent. You're not going to see another hockey stick from Q3 to Q4. So hitting expectations in Q3 is what we're focused on now, with that expected to continue into the fourth quarter. Christopher Kubasik : I'll just chime in, Noah. At a higher level, the approach we've taken, and we talked to the leadership team, is let's just control the controllables. There's a lot of frustration, I think, out there in the system. And we're kind of taking the approach that -- the last 2 years have clearly been unprecedented, whether it's pandemic, Ukraine, inflation, supply chain, all the stuff we know.  So when we give the guidance for the second half that Michelle laid out, we want to let you know it's kind of hard -- it's harder than it has been in the last several decades to predict the future and the visibility, given the uncertainty and the volatility that changes literally on a daily basis.  There are some days where we get a call from a supplier that they're going to be a week late. And the next day, someone shows up a week early. I mean, it's really very, very dynamic. We're trying to stay calm and relax and control what we can control and mitigate those things that we can't and then communicate to the best of our ability what the upside and the downside is.  The interesting thing is we're just talking about a ballway in all cases. We're not losing things. Sometimes they take longer to get awarded and sometimes they slip, but we're looking forward to the new norm and some of these uncertainties dissipating. Michelle Turner : And Noah, just to go back to your question in terms of cash. The expectation for the second half is really split between Q3 and Q4, more like a 30-70 split. Operator : The next question is from the line of Morgan Stanley, at Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : You were down selected for Phase I of the stand-and-attack weapon. So a strike weapon like this sounds like relatively new territory for LHX. And you're up against competitors with strong missile heritage. Can you talk about your strategy here? Is the missile market something you're focusing on more generally? Or is there something about this program that plays to your traditional strength? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No, that's a great, great question. We started investing in weapons, I think, going back 4 or 5 years. When -- I mentioned we set up the Agile Development Group. This is right in their sweet spot. We have multiple classified opportunities.  This is an air-to-ground tactical missile. I think it's -- when you look at the budget, you look at the threats, you look at our capabilities, I think we're in really good shape here. We've taken a clean sheet approach. And I think that's what's going to be the differentiator. I mentioned that on Armed Overwatch. I mentioned it here, right? We're not taking an existing capability that's been successful for decades and tweaking it. We're taking a clean sheet approach.  We're investing in our in our Seekers, which I think is unique and has great capabilities. And I'm proud of the team to see us get down selected on this one. There's classified things where we're also getting down selected.  Like anything, it starts out a little slow. I think there's 3 of us. I know there's 3 of us. And sometime in August, we'll get the Gate 2 award. And I think in 2023, early '23, they'll probably down select to 2, and then the fly offs and the fund begin.  So this is clearly a core competency for us. It's a market that I like. And I think it's similar to what I've talked about. It's going to disrupt the market. And I think a lot of people were surprised when they hear L3Harris want a stand-and-attack weapon. And there'll be more of this in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research. George Shapiro : I was wondering on the cash flow, your inventories are up like 260 million in the first half. I assume some of that's due to supply chain issues. Where do you expect that to go? Or where does it need to go for you to meet your cash flow guidance because obviously, like usual, it's much more second half weighted than first half? Michelle Turner : Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So when you look at our first half versus second half, you're absolutely right. Most of our cash generation is in the second half, with a healthy amount of that coming from working capital reduction assumptions.  And so to your point about the inventories, clearly, we are building in anticipation of that second half ramp. And so when you look at our product-based revenues, which is about 25% of our overall portfolio, that is a key driver in terms of our sales uptick within the second half.  The other piece I would note is within our ISR missionization business, to the extent that we are buying aircraft in anticipation of those programs coming online in the second half, that also sits within the inventory.  And so Chris noted several programs that we're pursuing. We anticipate a couple of those happening of the 4 or 5 we're pursuing in the second half. And so that will alleviate the inventory pressures as well to allow us to meet the cash expectations. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Robert Spingarn : Chris, I wanted to extrapolate on some of these prior questions about hockey sticks and recovery. With all these noncontrollable headwinds that you talked about in '22, so the elongated supply chain impact and slow outlays and tight labor, et cetera, and then the strong bookings, rising budgets, could '23 or '24 be a spring-loaded year?  In other words, you don't necessarily capture in the back half of this year, but then we have sort of a monster year in '23 or '24. And could that in and of itself present capacity issues? And then for Michelle, just how much risk is there to this year's guide if we have a CR in Q4, especially now that you're pointing to the low end of the guidance? Christopher Kubasik : Okay. No, great questions. And to answer the first one, I mean, you kind of got to it. The CR is going to be something that could obviously impact '23. I think you called it a monster year, is that what you said? So I'd love a monster year, whenever that is.  But no, the capacity, I don't see as being an issue. We invested in the prior years. We have a world-class factory, if you will, out in Salt Lake City for the Broadband Communication Systems business. They've had a great couple of months here with the win of CEC, the Cooperative Engagement Capability I mentioned earlier, which is JADC2, the EAGL program.  Of course, they'll hopefully get next-gen jammer. So we've made those investments up in Canada. We've invested in a new facility for WESCAM, where we're seeing the surge in the turret. We mentioned the extra capital that we spent in Rochester.  So for the product quick turn businesses, I think we have the capability. Labor is probably more of a potential constraint than the actual facilities themselves. If we get the supply chain turnaround, I think we'll be okay.  And we've been doing pretty good on the labor front. We've hired over 4,000 people so far this year. We have the same challenges with attrition that the rest of the industry does. But we're hiring interns. We're hiring new college grads.  I think it's a company that people find interesting and exciting, and we're getting literally hundreds of thousands of resumes to come work for us. So I feel pretty good about that.  Relative to '23, we're actually going through our strategic planning process now. We talk about low to mid-single-digit growth, but some of the stuff is pretty lumpy. And we should be in a position if we can get these wins to continue our top line and bottom line growth. Michelle? Michelle Turner : Yes. So in regards to the question on CR, our guide assumes that there is some level of a CR in the second -- in Q4 of this year. Operator : Our final question will be from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Michael Ciarmoli : Maybe can you guys just quantify what the margin headwinds are that are coming from inflation and labor? I don't know if you could parse out what's sort of the bigger impact. And I think the investor letter mentioned that you've got a relatively quick turn or short-duration backlog.  Maybe you can walk us through how long it takes to flow through price increases on raw materials or higher billing rates? And how we should maybe think about the margin evolution as you can pass through some of those prices? Michelle Turner : Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. So consistent with what we shared back in our last call, we anticipate about $100 million of gross inflationary impacts within the year. We had about $20 million of that play out within Q2.  And to your point about our overall program mix, about 50% of our portfolio is fixed price. It's about a year in terms of duration. And so we're starting to see some of the inflationary pressures prior to having EPA clauses in our contracts starting to play out here in the second half of the year.  We'll see that into 2023. Where we're focusing on what we can control right now is ensuring a new contracts that we are placing clauses that allow for this inflationary environment. But we anticipate that through the middle of next year to probably Q3, Q4. We'll see some remnants of the impacts of the current economy and the inflationary environment. Okay. So before ending the call, I want to take a moment to recognize our 47,000 strong L3Harris teammates around the globe. And thank you for remaining focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, particularly in support of meeting our customers' critical missions.  What you do matters in terms of making the world a safer place. Thanks, everyone, for your time today, and have a great weekend. We look forward to connecting again in the next few months. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market closed yesterday Today's call will primarily be focused on answering your questions. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. Before going to questions, Chris will make some brief comments. Chris Kubasik : In the midst of quarterly results and financial outlooks, we can easily lose sight of the importance of the mission. Delivering the technologies to our war fighters who are never in a fair fight is imperative. Earlier this week, we lost a great American and pioneer in Defense. Dr. Ash Carter fostered collaboration between Silicon Valley, the defense industrial base, and the Pentagon. He successfully changed the way we combat terrorists and he opened combat roles to women. Many of us at L3Harris, including our Board of Directors, either knew or worked for Ash Carter. We all send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Before jumping into questions, as we normally do, I'd like to make a few comments. By now, you have read our investor letter and much like you've heard from our peers, it's clear that we're operating in a dynamic environment. Starting with the good news. My team's energy and excitement continues to build as our trusted disruptor strategy is yielding tangible results and is well-aligned with the recently released National Defense strategy. We've carved out a leadership position as a non-traditional prime with a record quarter of over $5 billion in funded orders and a book-to-bill of roughly 1.2. These were driven by notable prime position awards related to Armed Overwatch for SOCOM, responsive space with the SDA tracking tranche 1 and network systems for the US Navy. We also announced our first acquisition since the merger. We're acquiring Viasat's Tactical Data Link business and gaining access to the ubiquitous Link 16 network. This product line fits nicely in our comms and networking-centric portfolio, enabling us to bring the DoD's JADC2's effort to life. Our momentum is building, and I'm optimistic about the value-creating opportunities ahead. Conversely, on the not so good news, we rightsized our 2022 guidance based on current realities. We previously highlighted a steep ramp in the back half of the year. And while we're making progress, today's backdrop necessitates a more measured approach. Let's start with the top line. We grew for the first time in four quarters at 3%, though fell short of our mid-single-digit expectations. This is because of two primary factors. First, we were previously selected for a Mideast aircraft missionization program that included a profitable sale to a key customer, but the formal signing of the contract has now been pushed out as the shifting geopolitical landscape continues to hamper the timing of certain international awards. This would have supported two points of growth for the full year, alongside profits and cash. Second, supply chain headwinds continue, and although improved, the recovery was not aligned with our expectations. As a reminder, with our commercial business model, 25% of our revenue is tied to end unit deliveries. We need 100% of the parts to assemble our products, such as a radio in order to make deliveries and recognize revenue. Thus, we are taking a more prudent approach in the fourth quarter as the availability of mainly electronic components remain volatile. So our expectations is for a 2% decline in 2022 versus the roughly 1% growth we pointed to previously. We ultimately view these as deferrals versus lost sales. Next, on segment margins. The approximately 16% in our previous guide is going to be closer to 15.5% and in the range of our year-to-date average. This is a result of net higher inflationary input costs offset by proactive cost actions focused on controlling what we can. As expected, the reduced revenue and margins are driving the guidance decline in EPS and free cash flow. On 2023, I know there's a lot of focus here, and we'll properly guide with year-end results as we typically do in January. That being said, our expectation is for improving revenues and relatively steady margins, while growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share year-over-year. This remains a work in process for the next couple of months. So a tough, but necessary financial update. We remain focused on executing our strategy of being a trusted disruptor and controlling the controllables in today's dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thanks so much. Good morning, guys and Chris, thanks so much for your letter and kind words on Secretary Carter. I think, there's no doubt that you're not only a trusted disruptor, but you add a human element to everything that you do, whether it's talking to the DoD or the investor community, and you picked a partner in Michelle that does the same. So just wanted to mention that. But in terms of my question, in the letter, you talked about analyzing the situation over the next few months prior to providing 2023 guidance. So, how do you think about maybe the pinch points, whether it's on sales or margins and how you're thinking about the range of outcomes? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, Sheila, first of all, thanks for the kind comments. The whole team here is highly motivated to support the war fighter and our customers, as you know. Why don't I focus on the sales or revenue piece, and then I'll ask Michelle to talk about the margins as we planned for 2023? I noted the book-to-bill strength, and the strategy is working. We're winning a lot of business, including prime, I highlighted Armed Overwatch as an example. And just to show you the speed and agility with which we work, we'll be making our first delivery in 2023 as an example. We had previously won Tranche 0, and we have launches scheduled for March of 2023. We won Tranche 1 for SDA tracking for 14 satellites, and those are obviously doing well and scheduled for launch later in this decade. We haven't talked about HBTSS in a while. That launch is looking good for mid-2023. So while we may not recognize revenue upon launch, I just want to highlight the cadence in the volume and the speed in which we're working. And just looking at the manifest the other day, we have about 40 spacecraft scheduled to be launched in the next 24 months. So that gives you an idea of how we're doing in the space world. We talked historically about some of the airborne headwind, using that as kind of a proxy for F-35, which decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. I think like everybody else on the program, we're kind of seeing a leveling off. So we will not have that headwind. It won't provide a tailwind, but nonetheless, it will flatten out. So the supply chain is really the focus, and it is quite volatile. I can assure you, relative to that, I may give more detail on a subsequent question if I get one. But booked CS grew 4% for the quarter. TACOM was double digit. Of course, that was to a pretty easy compare a year ago. So we're going to just look at the progress we're making as of November and December, and that run rate will give us insight. I think we all tend to talk about supply chain as a homogeneous entity. But, as you know, it's much more fragmented. We see improvements in shipping and components and chemicals, but there's still a lot of turmoil, as you would expect with electronic components. So we'll take the last available data and then give guidance that we have confidence we'll be able to achieve for 2023. Michelle? Michelle Turner : Yes. And I'll just add before jumping into the margins. When we look at our overall portfolio, just a reminder for those on the call, 25% is recognized in terms of revenue based on delivery. So that's a little bit different than others within the industry. So as you think about some of the supply chain constraints and the deferrals associated with it, it really is the entirety of the revenue being recognized versus over like a cost incurred type of revenue recognition. Also, this is our higher-margin business. It runs about 25% for us. So again, to Chris' point, this is more reflective of deferred revenue versus lost. But just to give a little bit more color in terms of margins, how it's playing out in 2022 and how we're thinking about 2023, to Chris' opening comments, we did reduce our guide to 15.5 from an overall segment perspective, really driven by two things. One was around the volume mix, in terms operating aircraft missionization along with the supply chain constraints, these tend to be margin accretive for us across our own portfolio. But also just in recognition of the overall macro operating environment, you're hearing this consistent with our peers. Higher input costs, whether it be supply chain, labor, inflation, along with things like redesigning parts internally to ensure we can continue to meet our customers' critical missions, all of that is equating to about a $250 million incremental cost headwind for us in 2022, of which we are doing what we can to control the controllables, and we've been able to successfully offset about 70% of that increased cost across the overall ecosystem. So, as we think about 2023, we're taking all of these data points into effect, along with where do we land at the end of the year from a supply chain perspective. Given that 40% of our overall portfolio is short cycle in nature, that data point is going to be very relevant in terms of how do we set guidance, both from a top line and bottom line perspective for next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Robert Stallard : I'd like to delve into the non-cash charges that you booked this quarter. And what exactly drove the timing of those charges being taken here? And in particular, you mentioned that the demand for precision guidance seems to be weakened, but that would go against the grain given the broader defense environment we're seeing. Michelle Turner : Yes. So, I'll take this, and Chris feel free to jump in, in terms of overall demand. But thanks, Rob, for highlighting this. I think it's creating some noise in terms of our overall reporting. So, it's a good opportunity to talk about. This is really a continuation of what we've been amplifying across our portfolio. So, just to put this into perspective, we have $18 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet related to the L3Harris merger. We took a $800 million charge within Q3. It's about 4%, 4.5% of the overall balance. Really targeted at two of our legacy businesses that we've been talking about for a while in terms of being on the low end of our portfolio from a growth perspective. And so as we went through our strategic plan over the last month, along with the updated DoD budgets, and really aligning with what we've been highlighting the areas of focus from a customer perspective to what we're seeing within our overall product portfolio, this is really just a continuation of two of our legacy businesses where we've highlighted risk associated with these businesses as we're investing in areas from a DoD perspective, like space and cyber. Similarly, we have parts of our portfolio that are going to be on the lower end of that growth spectrum. So, not a surprise here. This is consistent with what we've been talking about across the overall portfolio. Chris Kubasik : And I think, Rob, to the timing question, I think most companies look at this at the end of the year per the requirements for goodwill accounting. But to the extent you become aware of an instance to do a check, you ought to do it. So, when we looked at the rising interest rate environment, and as Michelle said, having just completed our preliminary plan, we went ahead and ran the numbers and took the charge here in Q3. So, that's the timing. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Chris, Michelle, Rajeev, good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Richard Safran : Chris, I appreciate and I really like the commentary in your letter. But I was really surprised to see you categorize defense budget environment under ugly. So, I have two things I want to ask you here. First, nobody thinks that CR is good, but they're generally short-term. Do you think -- or is your thinking that the CR could go past December? And more importantly is if we just exclude the CR for a moment, given the bipartisan support for defense, do you hold a positive view of defense spending and see continued year-over-year increases above inflation and especially as it pertains to L3Harris programs? Chris Kubasik : Yeah, Rich. Rich, thanks for that. We did lay out the good, the bad, the ugly. Clearly, the war is ugly. So there's no dispute in that regard. And for those of us that run a business, we like to have things done on time and on an annual basis. And to be honest, the CRs are getting old. I think this is the 15th CR in 20 years. So it almost becomes the norm. But I still hold out hope that we can have a budget in a timely manner. So to your point, specifically, on the CR, we do have an election upcoming as we know, in November. So we'll see how that plays out. And I'm hopeful that we have a budget and the conference occurs in December. But when you look at the total debt that's accumulating in our country, you look at the debt ceilings, many of us were around and remember sequestration and Budget Control Act, and all those things that are looming out there does give me concern. The PBR was $773 billion. And we have the different markups from 777 to 819, and a couple of things in between. So there has to be a conference. There has to be a process and \u2013 until it's signed, it's hard to run the business. And I think, when I talk to my industry peers, we all agree. We prefer to have a budget approved. And I think, there is some potential that this thing could get extended past December, and put the same pressures on our business that we experienced this year. So on the upside, when I look at all of our customers internationally, we're seeing budget increases aligned with the threats. So there is some good news there. The overall budget environment is growing. We just need to get it. When I'm in the Pentagon in D.C., trust me, the customers have the same feeling. They probably hate a CR more than I do. So I decided to call it ugly, until we have a budget. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the supply chain and communication systems. This has been \u2013 you also highlighted this as an issue for some time. And what I'm trying to understand here is, at one point, it was about semiconductors and then it appeared to expand a little bit into some other components. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand is how you \u2013 how confident you are \u2013 you're on top of this now that \u2013 are you seeing basically the same components as a problem? Has this expanded more? And then, if I can tag on to that, as you have delays in shipments, you talked about pent-up demand in the letter. Should we be expecting a surge at some point back in terms of deliveries, say, in late 2023 or into 2024? Chris Kubasik : All right, Doug, thanks. Let me take the first part on supply chain. I'll ask Michelle to comment on the surge. And it's a great question. And I'll say, I think we have control over the situation, but let me explain the complexities as we were reviewing this a week or so ago. And I'll just use TCOM as an example. So in the quarter, we delivered about 12,000 radios. And you've heard me say and Michelle say, and we'll probably continue to say, we don't book the revenue, the profit until we make the delivery. So they were split between manpack radios call it, 8,000 manpacks and 4,000 handheld radios. And when you go down into the details, and we looked at the schematics, talk to the team, I think Michelle was just up there a few weeks ago at a KIA event on supply chain that we hosted. There's about 10,000 parts in a manpack; 5,000 in a handheld. I'll do the math for you. The bottom line is we needed 100 million parts to deliver those 12,000 radios. So we monitor this on a daily basis. I would say we get 97.5% of the parts in. But I said in my prepared comments, if you don't have all the parts, you can't deliver a radio. You can deliver an airplane with missing parts. You can deliver a ship with missing parts, and you deliver a lot of things with missing parts, but you can't deliver a radio or arguably night vision goggles or cameras. So I think that's what's unique. And the question got to be, do we know what the heck we're doing here, which this is a fair question, you didn't ask that, but I'm sure that's on people's minds. So we looked at a key supplier as an example, where we ordered 18 months ago, 25,000 parts. We have a commitment. We pay the cash, all the good stuff you would expect. But the mid-September delivery, which would have allowed us to ramp up and maybe get closer to our prior guidance, only 5,000 parts arrived because there's an allocation process. So these commitments and all of us, me personally talking to CEOs of major corporations, you get the commitment that passes through the system, and they get an allocation and we come up short. So this happens on a regular basis. We're leveraging DPAS. Like I said, we have executive outreach. We have contacts. We look at this daily. But that's an example of maybe it's down in the weeds, but that's what we're tracking, 100 million parts for one entity for one quarter, and that's how we came up where we are. And that's why, to Sheila's question, we'll look and see how November and December, we do track I'll just stick with radios, but I can go through all the entities if you want. We have about 400 key suppliers. We had 30 that were on the watch list back in Q1. We're down to 10 that are on the watch list, meaning either poor quality or cutting the allocation. So that's where we are. And that's why I can say, we're making progress, but you almost have to be perfect in that regard. So I don't know, Michelle, if you want to supplement what I said or talk about the surge. Michelle Turner : Yeah. So a couple of things I would highlight. I think on the positives, right, we continue to see sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter. So even with the guidance change, I think it's important to note that we assumed a significant ramp-up within the second half. So although we're disappointed that we're not getting to the ramp that we originally had anticipated, we are seeing improvement from where we started having this acute pain point in Q3 of last year versus where we're at today. The other thing I would highlight is we continue to see really strong demand across communication systems, particularly within our TCOM business. Chris noted the record $5 billion bookings that we had within the quarter that was led from Tactical Communications. And then if you look at our backlog, it continues to grow. We started the year at $1.3 billion. We're ending Q3 at $1.9 billion. So going into next year, we're certainly going to have a strong tailwind in terms of demand for the product. To Chris' point, however, this is going to be muted a bit by this headwind from a supply chain perspective. We do anticipate that it will continue to be volatile through the end of next year. And our challenge is getting our arms around expectations for 2023 with the recognition that we continue to see volatility even within a quarter, particularly within our short-cycle businesses like communication systems. One thing I do just want to highlight because I want to give huge -- Chris noted that I was up in Rochester at an AIA event a few weeks ago. I want to give props to the Rochester TCOM team. We talk a lot about the supply chain volatility and our ability to react. And again, we're disappointed with the results but just gaining an appreciation for what it takes to actually deliver on what we did deliver on in terms of that double-digit growth within the quarter. But what we don't talk a lot about is the demand volatility that goes along with that. And so the team received an urgent request order for Ukraine At the end of Q3, we were able to book and turn that within a matter of seven days. And so it just speaks to the agility from internally within the company. But it also speaks to how we're rising to the challenge from a mission perspective, ensuring -- even with all of these things that continue to disrupt and create volatility within our ecosystem, we're continuing to put the mission of our customers first. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Scott Deuschle : Chris, this quarter reminds me of the old L3, to be honest, which was always pretty unpredictable and prone to surprises. I had thought with the switch to an operating company type approach that this would perhaps be less prone to happening since you'd have better visibility into the business. So maybe just help us understand why the switch to the operating company approach hasn't driven better predictability or would you just say that it has helped and it's just that the environment is simply too unpredictable? Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Scott, thanks for the question. And what I like about your question is it kind of aligns with the culture that we're trying to build here at L3Harris. And that is just encouraging people to speak up and ask the tough questions. And I appreciate you asking it actually because, as you can imagine, I kind of had a similar thought across my mind having taken over L3 back in 2018. So this was the whole basis -- one of the key basis of the merger is how do we accelerate that transition from holding companies, which really doesn't work in this industry for a variety of reasons to an operating model. So I think it has helped. I think if we go back and look, it's probably been at least 12 months for certain, and clearly, the last six months that Michelle and I in public forums and other venues have been pretty outspoken about the risks. I think it was in the second quarter, we talked -- I mean I go back to January, right? And we were very transparent in my opinion. And we said, look, we're going to shrink in the first half and then we're going to go up the steep slope in the second half. And as you would expect, we were -- honored our word and we shrunk in the first half. I wasn't happy about it, but that was the plan, and we executed accordingly. And we really needed to have a good ramp here in Q3. And we laid out there were three main components that were going to drive it. One occurred, which is just our normal focus on delivering quality products on time. We had an assumption on supply chain, which I think I've given enough examples on the 100 million parts and that one supplier as an example that came up short. And then this Mid-East International missionized aircraft which was just a matter of getting the contracts signed. So it was probably the 20th of September with 10 days to go where we figured this contract is going to be signed. And you get down to the 29th, and it's not signed, its 2 points of revenue for the whole year. So I would say, we have very good visibility. I, personally, along with Michelle, participate in monthly financial reviews. I don't think there's a lot of companies who have their CEOs involved in a monthly review at the level and size of our company. So we have good visibility. We track the risks. We mitigate them where we can. Opportunities pop up like Ukraine. We capitalize on those. And we're trying to be transparent and measured and prudent in telling you what's happening. So, I think, that was a great question, and hopefully, that addressed it. Michelle Turner : Yes. The only thing I would add to it, Scott, just going back to our previous example, and I think what you're seeing within our portfolio that's different than maybe others within the industry is this revenue recognition for 25% of our portfolio being on delivery, right? And so, you could be missing a part in a program-based scenario, but you're still going to recognize the revenue. Here, if we don't have every part, we're not going to recognize that. And to Chris' point, when you think about a radio, we can book and turn those pretty quickly within a week. And so, I think, you get the combination of the fact that we take revenue based on delivery, coupled with the short cycle nature, there can be and there has been and there will continue to be volatility within the quarter. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please, proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, David. David Strauss : Chris, I just want to see, as we think about next year, does adjusted EPS grow, given, I think, you're going to have a pretty meaningful pension headwind? And then, I think you said that free cash flow is going to grow. But if you can give us some of the mechanics there, because I think you're also going to have a pension cash headwind as well. Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, there\u2019s got to be -- the free cash flow, we have the tax cap -- the R&D capitalization. That's still something we're watching assuming that there's no fix to that issue. The impact of that will be about $150 million less. So if we can grow the top line, we'll keep the margin steady. We should have a little more cash from operations plus the $150 million from taxes. So that gives me confidence in free cash flow growth and free cash flow per share growth. The current outlook just on the pensions is on cash at zero. We're going to be funded in the mid to high 90s. So there is no cash draw on pensions. Relative to adjusted EPS, I'll ask Michelle to give you the details on the pension. But, yes, there will be a pension headwind. We'll true up those final assumptions at the end of the year. So we'll give you the impact. And I think, we just got to see where the year ends up and what we give for next year. I think it could be flattish to maybe up or down a couple of points, depending on the final assumptions where we end 2023 -- I'm sorry, where we end 2022 as a takeoff point for 2022. So, Michelle? Michelle Turner : Yes. So to Chris' point, just to hit a couple of your questions, David, we don't anticipate having to do any incremental funding from a pension perspective but well-funded. When you think about the income line and EPS, two impacts there, very consistent with what you heard from our industry peers. On the FAS income line, we anticipate that will be about $150 million impact going into 2023. And then from a cash recoverability perspective, consistent with what we've shared historically, we expect that to continue to dwindle over the next few years with it representing about a $50 million impact in 2023. So, in totality, about $200 million. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Hey good morning guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was wondering if you could elaborate on your comments about potentially stable margins next year. Obviously, the CS volatility, you've explained. But on the other two segments, do you think -- like can you maybe describe or quantify the headwinds you see as of now that you're going to need to offset? And maybe just talk about stable relative to what the full annual 2022 levels of margin or kind of the exit rates out of the year? Thanks. Michelle Turner : Yes. So, just to give a little bit of color and context, and feel free, Chris, to jump in as well, here is kind of how we're thinking about it. What's going to be key is how we close the year from a Q4 perspective, particularly within tactical communications given the margin impact across all of our product portfolio. Within that, there's also a mix component, right? So, we've seen strong demand internationally. And so these are tailwinds as we think about going into next year. From a headwind perspective, it's really around the macroeconomic environment, right? We're continuing to see higher input costs. I talked about that in terms of 2022 impact. But as we think about going into next year, what does that look like is we're going to -- we're assuming that it's going to continue to be volatile. There's going to continue to be rising costs. And then the actions that we're taking internally to offset that. And I think a great example of this is we announced the voluntary retirement program at the end of Q3. That's going to help us as we think about inflation next year, particularly on the labor side of the equation. And so it's -- how does all of that come together in terms of our guide, which we're triangulating around this relatively flat point based on what we know today. Chris Kubasik : And Gautam, it's so important to have a talented workforce in order to execute on everything we talk about. So, a lot of our focus of the leadership team has been to keep the workforce engaged and motivated. And I think we can all admit over the last couple of years, we found new ways to do work. The attrition was hard hit for, I think, every company, but it seems this industry in particular, that seems to have stabilized a little bit. But we're spending a lot of time focusing on the workforce, and there will be headwinds in 2023 compared to 2022. We're going to have a larger merit increase pool. We're holding the medical dental vision co-pays flat year-over-year. Everybody is going through open enrollment as we speak, and we're getting great, great feedback on that decision. But these cost money, and it's a decision that I and the leadership team made that we're going to spend more money on the workforce, and that does provide a headwind to the margins, which we're going to try to find a way to absorb. But I'd rather make these investments now, keep the workforce engaged, motivated and focusing on the programs that they support. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yeah. Good morning, Chris, Michelle. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Peter Arment : Michelle, you mentioned the 40% short-cycle exposure. Maybe you could just update us your thoughts on just your ability to reprice or get pricing in that help offset inflation, how we think that flows through when we're thinking about 2023? And then just, Chris, as an aside, you've given us a lot of details on the supply chain. But just are your thoughts on any further vertical integration to help either redesign or help try to limit some of the disruptions that you've had? Thanks. Michelle Turner : Thanks, Peter, for the question. So just a reminder for folks, about 25% of our overall portfolio is what we consider commercial, and we have the ability to reprice in an environment like we're in today. And so teams are doing a good job in terms of as we're reacting to the higher input costs, ensuring that we're getting priced where the market will accept those price increases. As I think about 2023, and I think one of the benefits of our portfolio is that we do -- on our program side of the house, which is about 50% of what we do or 75%, including the cost side piece, it tends to be shorter in nature in terms of period of performance. And so our average period of performance is about 12 to 18 months. And so if you think about this increased inflationary environment starting in the middle of this year, I anticipate that, by the end of next year, we've worked through that backlog that was priced in the pre-inflationary environment. And so I think that's one of the advantages that we have, given our shorter cycle nature, but it also plays into how are we thinking about guidance for next year and going back to -- there's multiple variables that we're taking into consideration, that being one of them. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. And to your supply chain question, I should have emphasized we're continuing to redesign our existing products, in the old days, I think a lot of companies had a process that focused on design for cost, given the focus on affordability. There are new initiatives that have come about in the years past, we post merger, really focused on design for manufacturing as a way to not have the engineers design something so complicated that we can't actually build it in an efficient manner. And of late, we're rolling out and have been rolling out our design for supply chain. So you now have to consider all those factors when designing a new product, which we're doing and, in our case, redesigning our existing portfolio, if that makes sense. Relative to the vertical integration, if we were suggesting acquisitions, I'm generally against making acquisitions to acquire a sub or a supplier. But it does bring up the point that everything is changing. And I think that's where our company is unique, the ability to adjust. And we keep talking -- we're not going back to the old days. And in the old days, you had a single supplier and now we're going to probably have two or three sources of supply. In the old days, you did just-in-time inventory, and that doesn't work anymore. Lead times, as I mentioned in that one example, are going out 18 months versus 18 days. So the company that can adjust and accept these new realities, which I think we have, will ultimately play off in the long-term. So that's how I look at it. We're still continuing to work with lots of high-tech Silicon Valley and disruptive companies, smaller companies we've talked about through our venture capital and Shield as an example. I think so far, we're up to 10 different investments, minority positions. But again, the key point there is to pool their technology into our portfolio. And I think that's starting to happen, and we're starting to see good receptivity from our customers because these companies can't get programs of record on their own. And I think we're the guys that are out there embracing and encouraging and working with them. And I referenced, I think, early on the National Defense strategy. And there's an interesting part of -- in the NDS that talks about transforming the industrial base. And it really talks about the focus of the prior strategies not incentivizing companies like ours to design open systems that can be incorporated into cutting-edge technologies. And it goes on to say that they're going to reward those companies with rapid experimentation, acquisition and fielding. So it was good to see the NDS come out, because it's consistent with what we've been talking about as a trusted disruptor, and now we just have to operationalize their strategy and our strategy to align. But I like seeing the reference to open systems, and I like seeing the reference to speed, because when you think of L3Harris, you should think of open systems and speed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ken Herbert : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Ken Herbert : If I could just starting off on the Tactical Data Links acquisition. I know obviously, it hasn't closed yet, but Chris, maybe you can provide a little bit more in terms of your thinking strategically how this supports the JADC2 opportunity and maybe how this just supports broader modification and upgrade opportunities? And could we see maybe an acceleration in the top line of that business once it's part of your portfolio? Because obviously, it's a relatively mature technology and a mature set of assets, but I think it could present some interesting opportunities. Chris Kubasik : Yes, Ken, thank you. I think you probably asked a great question and answered it at the same time. So let me see what I can supplement. I mean, well, first of all, as I've said before, we look at all of our acquisitions, this being the only one so far, strategically, operationally and financially. So strategically, I couldn't have asked for a better first acquisition. This was pretty straightforward and pretty easy, as you suggested. I mean it fits perfectly into our portfolio, fill the gap that we had. It ties into JADC2, networks comms, everything we're known for. And it gives us the footprint on 20,000 plus platforms and real estate matters on these platforms, whether they're aircraft or ships or other platforms. So we'll be able to modernize and upgrade Link 16. We'll be able to work in other way forms and focus on resiliency. So my expectation, I think you said it well, is it's an accelerant not only for their business but for our JADC2 efforts. And on the Tactical side, a little bit, we've been making the regulatory filings. Everything is tracking. We are still projecting a first half of 2023 close. And there has been some positive receptivity. We actually got a couple of calls from customers that we're so excited they wanted to meet. But of course, we have to wait until we close the deal. So we were excited to hear that already. Operationally, I think it will be pretty straight straightforward to integrate this business. And then financially, as I've said, it's accretive. So it also gives us, again, a seat at the table and continues to move us up the food chain. I'll just say on the \u2013 I mentioned this was the only one we did. We are active in the market. We did make a couple of bids on other properties. And I just point out from a financial discipline perspective we were outbid by like 50% or 60%. So we're not going to chase bad deals. We're not going to overpay, and we wish those lock that paid the prices they did. And maybe they were right and we were wrong, but you can't win them all. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ron Epstein : Yeah. Good morning. Just maybe a question and a follow-up. Forgive me, if you already talked about this a little bit, because I got on the call a little bit late due to a conflict. Anyway, why did you take the charges now? I mean, what was the impetus? And then Chris, I mean, were those legacy L3 businesses or legacy Harris businesses? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Well, let me go first, and then I'll throw it to Michelle. Yeah, you have to go back three years to remember this, but it was a merger of equals. And for accounting, one company had to acquire the other based on a variety of a \u2013 variety of rules. And I think the key rule is who had the larger shareholder base. So if my memory is right, I think it was 52-48, 52 Harris; 48 L3. So for accounting, Harris acquired L3. So, all the goodwill went to the L3 properties. Had it flipped, all the goodwill would have gone to the Harris properties. Pretty sure, we would have come up with the same answer regardless. But yeah, all this goodwill is applied to the legacy \u2013 from the acquisition, the legacy L3 businesses, and those were the ones that took the charges. But go ahead, Michelle. Michelle Turner : Yeah. And just timing-wise, Ron, to your question, this was as a result of going through our strategic plan process and aligning with the overall DoD priorities. I think it's important to note with these two businesses that, we've been illuminating for a while that they're on the lower end of the portfolio from a growth perspective. So there's no surprises here. It's really just part of the annual assessment, if you will, in looking at where the priorities are from a budget perspective, with our strategic plan and then the recognition that these businesses were already on the bubble to begin with. End of Q&A: Chris Kubasik : All right. Well, thanks, Michelle. And thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. I want to thank our 47,000 team members across the globe. It seems like, each year, we continue to get new challenges, and I appreciate your hard work and agility as we move forward. So before signing off, I'd like to acknowledge the progress the team has made on the ESG front, with their dedicated effort over the last few years. And for Sustainalytics, we've become a leader in the global aerospace and defense industry, recently ranking in the top 5%. So our non-traditional strategy is paying off on many levels. I hope everybody has a great weekend. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, and you may now begin. Rajeev Lalwani : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market close yesterday. So today's call will primarily be focused on answering your questions. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. Before going to questions, Chris will make some brief comments. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As we reported yesterday, our fourth quarter came in ahead of expectations, and our 2023 guidance points to steady or improving trends. We've also been active on the M&A front, consistent with our strategy, as opportunities present themselves. Let's start with Q4. The team delivered a solid top line, up 6% organically, with Communications leading the way as we saw improvements in electronic component availability within tactical comms. This contributed to the second consecutive quarter of organic growth for our company. Segment margins were about what we expected, with ongoing pressures from macro factors, including inflated costs for material and labor. The net of this is EPS just above our recently guided midpoint and free cash flow at our $2 billion outlook. Turning to 2023. We're consistent with what we said on the last call : Expanding our revenue in the 2% to 4% range, including the Link 16 acquisition, while holding our industry-leading margins steady at about 15.5%. EPS adjusted for pension headwinds points to a stable operating results, and we're expecting an improving cash flow profile. Lastly, on recent M&A activity, we've previously discussed an opportunistic approach within our balanced capital allocation framework. We had opportunities to acquire two unique assets in ViaSat's Tactical Data Link business and Aerojet Rocketdyne. We closed TDL in 13 weeks and are off to a strong start with integration. In fact, our newest employees are already on the L3Harris payroll system and participating in our 401(k) and benefit programs. This acquisition positions us well to play a central role in networking and resiliency for global defense customers and fills in a needed capability as we develop our JADC2 solutions. Regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne, it's a national asset critical to future warfare that has a leadership position in propulsion, adding exposure to new growth markets for us with munitions, space exploration and hypersonics. It brings nearly $7 billion of backlog and tailwinds driven by global demand. With both of these acquisitions, we'll utilize our recent experience from our merger of equals. We expect much of the integration work for TDL to be complete once we bring Aerojet Rocketdyne into L3Harris. We'll hold an Investor Day later in the year to talk more about the strategy and outlook for our growing company. So we're building momentum with our strategy and look forward to executing on our performance first initiative in 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : Yeah. Well, this question is going to have a few parts, I'm afraid because I want to understand a little bit more about your case for Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, you've talked a lot about it being a valuable asset. It diversifies your portfolio. But as you've also said, it's been a merchant supplier. So trying to understand, there are a few things here. When you look at it, what are some of the specific parts of the company that have potential for revenue synergy? Second, are there some areas of cost reduction there beyond just corporate costs? Because I know the facilities are difficult to move, for example. Third, are there things that you can do to improve operations and better performance for the end customers? And then last, when you're in this pre-close period, how do you ensure that the value of this asset doesn't deteriorate some over time? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thank you. Let me see if I can hit all of those. I'm sure there'll be several Aerojet Rocketdyne questions, but maybe I'll give a longer answer than usual and try to preempt some of those. So when we look at acquisitions, I'd like to start with the market. And when we're looking at the market data outside of platforms, the three largest global markets for defense are C2, which is command and control; sensors and weapons. So I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned on the first two, especially after the TDL acquisition. Our weapon presence in this $75 billion market is practically nonexistent. So we believe that weapons, munitions, missiles, whatever you want to call them, are absolutely aligned with the current and emerging customer demand. It is a growth market for the future fight. And solid rocket motors, especially for products like Javelin, STINGER, many that we know and hear about on a regular basis is a great way to position us in the missile and missile defense market. So I look at that from the munition side on the space, we have a long history of working with NASA and NOAA, so relative to space exploration and observation, we already have these relationships. We're honored or they're honored and soon us to be able to support SLS and Artemis, and there's visibility there for several years to come. And then the RL10 is a premium upper stage engine with well over 100 engines under contract with the ELA for the new Vulcan launch vehicle. And I think hypersonics doesn't really get the attention it deserves. And the other day, someone said hypersonics is the future. And the reality is hypersonics is now. And I think, this could be the crown jewel of the acquisition, and we believe there's significant growth opportunities that are well supported by the budget and the customers. So when I look at those three markets, I see growth. If I jump to the financials, if you will, as it relates to Aerojet Rocketdyne and what we can do, I mentioned the $7 billion of backlog, so longer cycle business gives us more visibility. I believe this will grow faster on the top line than our current portfolio. I believe we have the ability to improve margins and get those to be more in line with potentially what we're doing on a consolidated basis now over time. And there are several multi-year programs that will be coming up for renegotiation in the next year or two. And I believe as we continue to negotiate milestone payments, we'll be more cash favorable. So I throw that out there to maybe answer a couple of the questions. On the cost synergy, we believe there's something in the $50 million range easily from eliminating the public company cost and some of the duplicative overhead. You're right. We have no plans to move facilities, but I look at the footprint. We both have offices in D.C. We both have offices in Huntsville. There's some low-hanging fruit there, and we really didn't anticipate or plan at this point any synergies relative to supply chain. So we need to dig into that and of course, take the power of the new enterprise. So I think that that gets us on the - gets to your question, Doug, on cost synergies. And from L3Harris, we overachieved. And once we get into details, there's potential to continue to exceed those numbers from the cost synergy. Revenue synergy, given that these are new markets, and there's no overlap, we have no revenue synergies at this point in time. So that, I think, is a straightforward answer. I guess on the operations, it's clearly \u2013 I think we have great opportunities here to bring our skill set and enhance our \u2013 the performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne. And I look at what we did at L3Harris before the merger, look at the TR3 program as an example, and maybe our Waco facility. Both those locations are \u2013 the TR3 program was over budget in late. Waco facility was losing money. And with the scale of the new company, more talent, processes, policies, controls, the ability to attract new people, we were able to turn not only that program, but that business around. And I think those are the capabilities that we'll be able to bring to Aerojet Rocketdyne. Relative to pre-closing exposure, I don't think there's anything unique in this relative to other acquisitions. The integration team meets on a regular basis. I would think it's next week or the week after, we'll start having people on-site at some of these facilities as part of the integration process. As you would expect, Eileen Drake and I meet on a regular basis. So we, in fact, had a call yesterday and we have one every week and sometimes more. So I think that's how we're going to stay in touch, and we can do whatever we can to help them. I'm optimistic that this is going to be a very accretive and successful acquisition. We're excited. The employees are excited, and I apologize for the long answer, but I wanted to try to hit all five or six of your questions, Doug. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Robert Stallard : Chris, I'll keep it to one following up from Doug's question though. When you looked at Aerojet and you look to the other levers you could pull on capital deployment, why did you think this is the best option for shareholders to go with versus continuing with the share buyback? Thank you. Chris Kubasik : All right. Well, thank you. Well, first of all, it's consistent with our strategy. I think I've been talking for several years. We're building a new company to provide more competition within the industry and to give the DoD alternatives. So, I've been pretty consistent in saying we want to grow organically and inorganically. Different companies have different portfolios. And when I looked at the market and the team looked at the markets and we saw the focus and growth on munitions, it seemed to be a gap. So, we think over the long-term to mid-term, you're going to look back on this and see why this thing makes so much sense. I tried to lay out for Doug some of the strategy and some of the trends. But this company has some awesome employees and great technologies, and a great legacy and I think there's going to be continued growth in munitions and space and hypersonics for the long-term. Relative to capital deployment, yes, so that -- it was a -- I don't want to say it was a pretty easy decision, but it was consistent with what we wanted to do. There aren't that many assets available in this industry. And when they come to -- come available, you got to make a decision and act on them. And I'm excited that we got TDL done in 92 days and the integration is already underway. So, we can focus on getting Aerojet Rocketdyne approved and then start the integration. If you look at the investor letter, I think it's page 14, has a nice pie chart that kind of lays out our capital deployment over a five-year period and it shows us a fair amount of balance. But I don't foresee us doing any acquisitions for a couple of years, as you would imagine. We have some non-core assets that we're going to sell, and we're going to use those proceeds to bring down the debt over the next few years. We'll keep annual dividend increases and remain competitive, as you would imagine. And then we'll repurchase shares probably at least $500 million a year to absorb any dilution and depending on cash flow and other dynamics, that number could increase as we go forward. So, Rob, I think, hopefully, that answered your question. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. Chris, just on your last point, you've clearly been busy augmenting the portfolio with TDL and Aerojet. But how do you think about IRAD spend in 2023 versus 2022? You noted in your EPS bridge us $0.10 of internal investment headwinds and input costs. So, what are some of the products that you're focused on and these technologies accelerators that you're working on? And how do they contribute to your top line returning to mid-single-digit growth? Chris Kubasik : Yes. Good morning, Sheila. And yes, IRAD is something that we have been investing in year-over-year. We have industry-leading IRAD kind of in the 3.5% range. We've significantly increased what we call ERAD, our external R&D from customers. When I look at the two together, we're well over $2 billion. So we have a pretty good process to -- a very good process to prioritize how we spend that money. So I think through some of the exciting things, if I start in space, we're excited about the investments that we've made in some new optics that we'd refer to as replicated composite optics. Basically, this is a replacement for glass mirrors in telescopes made out of carbon graphite. So the exciting thing is it's about half the weight. It takes about two-thirds of the time to manufacture, and it's significantly less expensive. And we're going to be launching the first ever replicated optics in the middle of the year. So I think this is going to reduce risk. We'll see how it performs, but this could be a game changer for a satellite business. And the air and land domains with ViaSat, we're investing in the advanced Tactical Data Link with a lot more resiliency. So that's part of the whole strategy there to modernize Link 16. And I think we have the largest library of waveform. So we're very excited about that. And then, maybe on the maritime front, I'm pretty excited that our -- we've talked about our Iver vehicle in the past. This is our autonomous undersea vehicle, just recently has achieved the first ever repetitive submerged launch and recovery from a torpedo tube. This is a significant step for our company, and I think it gives us an opportunity to considerably enhance the nation's autonomous undersea capabilities. So trying to give you some tangible examples and each of those will result in new business programs of record and maybe give you some insight to what's coming out of all the money that we're spending, whether it's IRAD or ERAD. As you probably saw in the letter in other release, we have two new segment presidents join us this year, and I can speak for them and say as they went through our portfolio and looked at the IRAD and some of the things we're working on, both John and Sam were pretty excited about the potential. So thank you, Sheila. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning and congratulations on the progress this quarter. It's great to see. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Scott Deuschle : Michelle, are there any large ISR missionization contracts and the guides that haven't been finalized yet, particularly on the international side? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether there's any timing-related downside risk from that. Or if that's more just an upside opportunity, if one or more contracts do go your way? Thank you. Michelle Turner : Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Scott, and thanks for this, because it is important to note that, as we think about our guide for this year, we did take a different approach on a couple of things. Our ISR missionization business is one of them. So to directly answer your question, no, there are not any large international ISR pursuits in the plan. We do have one domestic pursuit, which we're anticipating in the first half of the year. We already have the aircraft. So that's minimizing the risk, and it's funded from a budgetary perspective. It's our C3D program. So we have four aircraft tied around that. And I think this is important, because as we walk through the guide that, this, along with supply chain, were the two key components when we think about how 2022 played out that's really influencing how we're thinking about our guide for 2023. And so I'll just hit supply chain upfront, because I'm assuming we're going to get the question. I'd be disappointed if we didn't get the question. But when we look at our guide for the current year, what we're assuming is something consistent with what we did in the second half of 2022. Coming off of the strong Q4 results, we're incredibly proud of all the teams across our product based businesses in particular. So I want to do a shout-out to our Tactical Communications team, WESCAM, PSPC, along with commercial aviation. We had a really strong finish to the year. And as we're building on that momentum coming into 2023, we're assuming that we're having consistent results in the second half of 2022 throughout the full year of the 2023 guide. And so to your point, Scott, around using what we learned in 2022 and influencing our 2023 outlook, there's really two key components. One was around the ISR missionization demand. And although we're continuing to pursue a handful of those programs with budgets being up, we're optimistic that we're going to be able to land a contract. We thought it was prudent at this point to not put that into our guide and it would be upside. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to go back to Aerojet and thinking about these cost synergies, I know they had previously executed on a $240 million cost takeout program. It seems like all of those savings went to the customers. And I'm just thinking about maybe the lack of margin expansion we've seen there. There's, obviously, been challenges in the rocket motor supply chain. I think Raytheon has been pretty outspoken there. Northrop is picking up, I think, the entire GMLRS motor production this year. What's the status of their production system? Do you think you have to make any investments? Is that contemplated in the cost synergies? And I guess maybe your level of confidence in margin expansion at that entity? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thank you, Michael. We do have confidence in margin expansion. I think when you look at the customer, or you look at the portfolio mix they have, it's like everybody in the industry, it's a combination of cost plus and fixed price. So I'm not sure it would all go back to the customer. It should obviously -- they should be able to keep it on the fixed price. But that's in the past. I'm looking going forward. Like any of these acquisitions, there are systems that are fragmented or maybe older technology just like when we put L3 and Harris together. Our IT organization knows how to convert these. I used my reference to ViaSat, the fact that those employees are already on our systems, and it hasn't even been a month. So most of the challenges, challenged program, and I know they've talked about it at length, seems to be at one facility. Like I said, we'll have people down there in the next week or two. And everything has been contemplated in our business case. One of the benefits of being a large -- part of a larger organization, again, this is an acquisition, not a merger, I just like to make a -- an important distinction. We are buying them. They're about one-tenth of our market cap, and this will be a quick integration relative to decisions that need to be made, and a lot of their systems will migrate on to ours, whether it's benefits, payroll, et cetera. On the ERP manufacturing execution systems, they've been putting those in. We're familiar with those systems, familiar with those systems, familiar with the technology. And all that has been contemplated. With our scale, we have the capital. We have the IRAD. We prioritize it, and we have the ability to invest as they have been doing to make them world class. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Hey. Thanks very much, and good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Seth Seifman : I wonder, if you could talk a little bit about the kind of the medium-term outlook for the Communications business. We recently saw a management change there, and the \u2013 the details of the management change suggest that you're looking for some really fresh and different thinking in a business that's been kind of the core of the earnings for the company. And we've seen some good growth in the radio budgets in recent years. But when we look out to the middle of the decade and beyond, it doesn't necessarily look as good. So, can you tell us about your medium-term thought process for communications? Chris Kubasik : No. Absolutely, Seth. Yeah. I mean, Sam joined us at the beginning of the year. When I look \u2013 I know a few people were asking questions relative to Sam and the business. I mean, CS is a short-cycle business with a global footprint, a lot of Army and Marine business. And when I hired Sam, like I do everyone, I look first and foremost for someone who's a leader versus a manager. And everywhere he's been, he's had success strategically, operationally and financially. Whether it's Collins, Sikorsky, UTC, he's led production. He's led programs. He's familiar with foreign military sales, direct commercial sales and a lot of experience globally. So I have no doubt he's going to be very successful and add value to the corporation. When I look at the medium term on comms, I don't want to underestimate the significance of the ViaSat acquisition and the focus on \u2013 on JADC2 and the ability to connect the networks, which the customer has been talking about, it seems like, for a decade. And I'm sure there's frustration on their part that we haven't, as an industry, been able to \u2013 to get that across the goal line. So when I look at the tactical radio business, we continue to see growth in the low to mid-single digits, not only here domestically where the modernization is going to continue. Internationally, in the fourth quarter, we got another contract from Australia that has been a great customer of ours. So the visibility we see continues to look good as the modernization continues the need for resiliency continues. And then I still think there is ability for the \u2013 more of a soldier as a system that's been talked about, but never quite brought across the goal line. So we have the ENVG goggles. We have the radios. There's connectivity that can happen at the soldier level and also networks at a higher level. So it's a key part of our business. And I think anything, as I've said before, over the past year, you look at the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate is critical to execute the fight of the future. And our resiliency and our capability is unique, and I think it's going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Hi. Good morning, guys. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : I was curious, Chris, if you could talk to where you guys are in the L3 kind of integration journey. Meaning a couple of years ago, you guys talked about $250 million of annual cost out for a number of years kind of moving from a holding company to an integrated business, et cetera, et cetera. I'm just curious where do you think you are on that journey? And then if you could just comment also on the supply chain and the pace of healing within it assumed in the guidance and what you saw in Q4? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Let me take the first part. I'll ask Michelle to talk about the supply chain. As part of our E3 continuous improvement initiative, I'd say we're never ever complete. We talked about a three-year plan to take out $500 million. We took out $660 million. We're going to stop trying to call out separately the one-time costs and the savings as we move into the next cycle of acquisitions. But I can assure it's an ongoing journey. I think we got the low-hanging fruit. We made a lot of progress. So, I'd say maybe we're two-thirds of the way through the integration. And when I look at the IT systems, the ERP systems have come down substantially. I think we used to say there were about 100. By the end of the year, we'll be in the 20s. So, that's good progress. We've got consistent manufacturing execution systems that we're implementing. The one in Greenville should be done this year. We have a couple in other facilities, done a good job on all the shared services. So, in that case, that would be done. The facility moves have been done. But the team is looking at each and every function and process and continuing to optimize it. So, like I said, we did the easy stuff and now we're going function-by-function, relooking at the policies, the procedures, the systems and continuing to look at ways to optimize the business, which will make us faster and ultimately take cash out. So, I'll go with two-thirds of the way through. I'll lateral to Michelle, see if she agrees with me and then have her give some supply chain insight. Michelle Turner : I always agree with you, Chris. But just to add a little bit more color, I think a great example of where we're continuing on this next phase is around our real estate and our footprint consolidation efforts. And so to Chris' point, we took the low-hanging fruit in the first couple of years. Byron Green and his real estate team have really been focused on what's the next phase of that. We're in the middle of a two-year plan to take out an additional 10% as a result -- 10% of our overall sites as a result of this current operating environment where we have more of a hybrid workforce. So, it's continuing to be an evolution that's going to continue to pay dividends for. It's really helping to offset some of the macro inflationary challenges that are permeating across the industry. And then just to give a little bit more color from a supply chain perspective, I talked about our 2023 guide. And the word I would use is -- to describe it as a balanced approach. Again, the guide assumes it's consistent with our second half 2022 performance. But just to make this a little bit more tangible, I think it's helpful to think about what's different as we think about 2023 versus what remains the same at the start of, say, 2022 or at the end of 2021. So, I'll illuminate a few things for you because I think it helps bound the risk as you think about our guidance. Frankly, it's how we're managing the business internally. So, what's the same? What's the same is we do continue to see hiccups from an overall supply chain ecosystem perspective. This is consistent across our industry and other industries. This is something that's become a bit of the new norm. What's also consistent is we do continue to be on a 90-day allocation process with our microelectronic chip manufacturers. And this is a really important point because even when we continue to see the improvements like we did within Q4, the reality is the insights that we're getting to our supply from a chip perspective is good for about 90 days out. Then it gets more nebulous as we get into the latter part of the year. And then finally, I know we've put some of this within our Q3 earnings call. But just a reminder, 25% of our portfolio, which is different than our peers, is tied to in product deliveries. But if we're short on chips or we're short on washers or nuts, we're not going to be able to deliver that radio or that turret. And so those things remain the same as you think about our 2023 guide. Now what is different, right? And we've been talking about a lot of this in 2022, but what's really different is those proactive actions that we took last year to be purposeful and focusing on the things we can control. They help to minimize the risk in 2023. And so just a reminder, engineering redesigns were a big focus for 2022. We get the full value of that benefit in 2023. Our alternate part bank within our Tactical Communications Systems business is up to 1,000 parts. That would have been at 100 parts in 2021. Our overall revenue base in terms of DPAS coverage, it's also increased double digits. So that aids in the prioritization of our supply and material availability. And then finally, I think this is the most important predictive indicator is the number of critical parts. When we started and we felt the most acute impact from supply chain was really in the second half of 2021. We had hundreds of critical part shortages at that time. Fast forward to where we are today, and we're in the 10s in terms of the impact and what we're having to manage through. So the way I would characterize this is we continue to see sequential improvement from a supply chain perspective. We're not out of the woods by any means. And so as a result, we're taking a balanced approach to 2023, and that's what's reflected in our guide. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hi. Thank you. So Michelle, just on the back of all of that, it seems like the positives are there might support higher margins in 2023. Now I know the guidance range allows for that. But what would cause the downside? Michelle Turner : Yeah. No, great questions. So let me walk through from a margin perspective. I'll start from the overall enterprise, right? To your point, Rob, we are assuming flattish margins, 15.4, 15.5-ish. From a headwind perspective, we are assuming continued macro inflationary challenges of about $400 million, so about 2.5% of our overall revenue. And we also have some headwinds from a mix perspective. Chris talked about where we're investing in space. Kelly and her team are doing phenomenal in terms of growing the business. At the same time, however, that will be a drag on our margins. As these new programs come on board, we typically book them at lower rates. And as we mitigate the risk, we start to see the profitability in those programs improve. So from a headwinds perspective, inflationary, challenges and mix, that is being offset by our continued strong E3 savings program, as Chris alluded to earlier. Real estate is a great example of that. Another great example is the voluntary retirement program that we announced at the end of Q3 last year. That's going to help to pay dividends and offset the merit increases that we're planning for from a human capital perspective. And then we've also assumed some level of commercial pricing. To your point, specifically, Rob, like what is the downside? The downside, from my perspective is this continuation of the unknown unknowns from an inflationary challenge perspective, right? There was a lot that permeated within 2022 that it felt like it was more of a reactionary year. And so, as a result, we're doing everything that we can to control the controllables. And we will prudently manage through that as we make our way through 2023. Chris Kubasik : And I'll just chime in that, if you recall, last time we talked about the importance of our workforce, keeping them engaged and motivated and focusing on some of the attrition. And recall, in October, we talked about some of the things we're doing that are unique. Michelle mentioned the increased merit. We also held all the benefit costs flat from an employee perspective. We've increased the budget for spot awards to recognize performance and some of the other initiatives. And that was a headwind and investments of over $100 million that we're absorbing in 2023 and that provides a little bit of a drag, but it was the right thing to do, and I'm confident it's going to pay off. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey. Good morning, guys. Chris, earlier you mentioned that the ViaSat deal closed 90 days ahead of expectations. Was this something that you did differently with this acquisition to help speed up the regulatory review? And how much of that playbook is applicable to the Aerojet Rocketdyne deal? Chris Kubasik : Yes. Great question and good morning, Kristine. Yes, I said we closed it in 92 days. We have been forecasting mid-year. We made all the appropriate filings for HSR. We responded to all the questions within the 30-day period, for ViaSat that is. There are some international approvals. And I think when you just looked at it, it made a lot of sense, and we weren't sure how that process was going to play out. Relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, mid-January, we made our HSR filing. We all know the FTC is reviewing it. We've been very responsive in answering their questions, and we'll see how that process works out. We're -- Eileen and I met with key customers jointly in the Pentagon to explain the rationale and answer their questions. So, I think it's just being transparent, being responsive and getting the data request in, in a timely manner, so the process can work. So we'll see how it plays out. But so far, everything is tracking. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Good morning, Chris, Michelle. Hey, Chris, the TD acquisition seems like it's a really great fit, as you kind of highlighted that you had two kind of capabilities. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about, if you see like a big product upgrade cycle or with that road map or what kind of opportunity it is for L3. Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Peter. Now look, we've talked about Link 16 being on 20,000 platforms. And that really gives us the ability to upgrade and modernize. So when I mentioned the IRAD we're spending on the advanced data tactical link, that's an obvious fit. One of the things we focused on in the negotiation, this was a carve-out. So that's a little unique as to what we buy, what we don't buy. And we really wanted to get access to a relatively small piece of the business, which was the Link 16 to space and Link 16 and Viasat's on the SDA transport. Later this year will be a launch. We will have the first-ever Link 16 capability in space. And I think, again, that's kind of the hidden jewel in this thing. There's going to be Link 16 in space. The connectivity from space to air is a game changer to focus on resiliency. So relative to revenue synergies, we're very excited about the potential here with ViaSat. So the upgrade is going to happen. We're investing in new products. We also have the existing product production that's going well. So I think we're going to look back on this one. It's going to look pretty successful and pretty straightforward and off to a good start. So hopefully, that helps. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Thanks. Chris, Michelle, Rajeev, good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Richard Safran : Chris, last year, I'm going to try two, because I think they're quick. So your letter indicates you're getting compensated for inflation on new contracts. I was just wondering on existing fixed price contracts, is the government allowing you any adjustments based on higher unforeseen costs? And if so, would that the upside to your guide? Second question is Chris, just given your knowledge on \u2013 I asked this of your competitors. It seems to be just a general view that, as we move into a deficit reduction, defense is going to be the bill payer. I was kind of curious about, though, your view of sentiment on the Hill and for continued defense spending and funding modernization? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thanks, Rich. On the first one, we have not received any compensation for inflation on fixed price contracts nor have we asked for any. Similar to COVID expenses and others, we just absorbed it as part of the business. I just kind of feel like we survived the - these three years, and everything is looking much better on the upside. Obviously, if we got money, that would be upside. But as of now, we're just moving forward and focused on the new contracts. If something changes or if the DoD encourages us to bring forward a claim of some sort, we'll do it. But there have to be clear documentation. It's not as easy as you would think to prove that. On the deficit reduction, it's something we're all watching. I referenced in the letter. And we're excited to actually have a defense budget to start our fiscal year. So a shout-out to everybody in the lame-duck section \u2013 the lame-duck session for getting that done. And it's a big deal for us and a big deal for the industry and probably even a bigger deal for the Department of Defense. So I think that's the type of thing that gives us confidence in the future. I mean, one thing is for certain. It's really hard to predict how that's going to kind of play out. I'm really not in the camp that thinks DoD is going to be the bill payer. I know, there's some rhetoric around that. People say things to get different leadership positions in Congress. But when you look at the threats out there, it's just hard to justify flattening or reducing the defense budget, and it's a dangerous world. And that comes back to these acquisitions and looking what's going to matter at the end of the day and what the future fight is. And it's situational awareness with ISR, it's resilient comms, and it's munitions. So I like where we are relative to those positions, Rich. Chris Kubasik : So I think with that, we'll wrap up. So I appreciate everybody calling in. I'm a big believer in momentum, and I feel like we have the beginning of some momentum with two consecutive quarters of growth, some acquisitions. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice and Michelle's, but we're really excited about the future and what the potential brings. And I know the initial feedback from the ViaSat employees has been all positive and the Aerojet Rocketdyne employees. And we've actually heard from many of the former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees who are also excited about the transaction. So, we're going to focus on the closing, get this deal done. And once it's closed, we're looking forward to connecting with any former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees and welcome them back if they're passionate about the mission. So, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years. But before I sign off, I wanted to recognize and thank Dana Mehnert for his 38 years of service. As you know, Dana announced his retirement in Q4 and is assisting with a smooth transition. So, we appreciate that, Dana and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. And I want to turn it over to Michelle real quick. End of Q&A: Michelle Turner : So, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today and for your continued interest in our company. Before we disconnect, I just want to take a minute. As many of you know, this will be Rajeev's last earnings call with us. And I want to thank you, Rajeev, for your contributions in our Investor Relations function, overall L3Harris and for me, personally, for my transition over the last year. We all wish you the very best in this next adventure. So, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice president, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Mark Kratz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. During our discussion, we may reference our Investor Letter that we published on our website yesterday. We're listening to investor feedback and have made some enhancements. Given the detail on this letter, this call will primarily be focused on answering questions. We may also discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference the Safe Harbor provision found in the Investor letter and our SEC filings. Lastly, we will frequently discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the Investor Letter. Before moving to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Good morning and thanks, Mark, and welcome aboard. We've been focusing on execution under our Performance First imperative and I'm pleased with our results. The first quarter was strong in many respects as we continue to build momentum with our trusted disruptor strategy, resulting in record orders and record backlog, improving macro trends serve as a positive backdrop, including the President's 2024 budget request released to Congress in March. We are well aligned with the priorities in the National Defense Strategy, which is reflected in robust funding and major areas for us, including space and joint force capabilities as well as missiles and munitions given our pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our goal for Q1 was to grow the top line, meet the EPS number and have positive cash flow. The team rallied and delivered on all counts. For a third consecutive quarter, we had top line growth, a 9% increase with each segment growing. Operating income was up in two of the three segments, despite the usual headwinds. However, we came in line with where we thought we would be to begin the year. This resulted in EPS of $2.86 and we anticipate building from there. Free cash flow came in at over 300 million, a significant improvement from a year ago and we also front loaded our share repurchase commitment for the year. We received a second request from the FTC in March, which was followed by the Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholder approval vote the following day. Both of these outcomes were expected and we are responding to the FTC. We still anticipate the deal will close later this year. First quarter results are differentiated winning strategy and the overall business environment led us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance with the recognition that record orders and strong revenue growth to date could support a bias towards the higher end of our revenue guidance range should these trends continue. We still have work to do on profitability, but with abating macro headwinds, operational improvement initiatives and accelerating sequential growth in product centric businesses, we remain committed to our full year EPS guidance. So we're off to a strong start and I'd like to recognize our employees for continuing to prioritize Performance First in everything they do. With that, let's open the lines for questions, Rob. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Akers : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to put maybe a finer point on the Rocketdyne timing. Have you I guess substantially complied with the FTC's second request you had, If not, sort of how much is left there? I think that's what starts the clock for that review. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Matt. Thanks for the question. We're gathering the data as you would anticipate. It's usually about a three to four month process. So we got the second request mid-March. So that would kind of suggest a June submission both for us and I know Aerojet Rocketdyne is doing the same thing. I have a feeling they'll probably submit a little earlier than us, given they've already done this, done this once. So, you know, the reason I'm confident in the 2023 close really comes down to the FTC's evaluation of this transaction. And, you know, when we look at it, we do not compete with Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, plain and simple, they make rocket motors and rocket engines and we do not. And that term is known as horizontal competitiveness. And there is none. We are not a customer of theirs. They are not a customer of ours, which is the term of art, the FTC and lawyers uses vertical competition. So I look at this and say, if there's no vertical competition and no horizontal competition, we'll submit the data, we'll certify the information, and we'll let the process run. You know, I think I'll just take a minute since I'm not sure I'll get any more Aerojet questions today. And I just think there's an incredible amount of confusion, mainly in DC, whether it's the DOD, the FTC or Members of Congress, and there are three terms that are used interchangeably that mean completely different things, and that is consolidation, merger and acquisition. And consolidation, in my opinion, is when two companies with similar capabilities combine and I think back 25 years to McDonnell Douglas and Boeing and they consolidated and nobody can dispute that after that transaction closed, there was one less commercial and military aircraft provider. And that's not what we're talking about today. A merger. I think a good example is obviously L3 and Harris. Two companies that are complementary, came together, which is now why we have capabilities and space, air, land, sea and cyber domains, significant revenue synergies, significant cost synergies over 650 million of cost savings that we shared with our shareholders and the DOD and resulted in a stronger company, in this case, providing more competition within the defense industrial base. And then Aerojet Rocketdyne is an acquisition. It's about 10% of our enterprise value. It's all cash. It's putting us into new markets that I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as high? That I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as highlighted in some of the recent budget decisions and fills in a gap in our portfolio. So I just felt I wanted to clarify that point and that is what gives me confidence that this deal will close in the second half of '23. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your quest0ion. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Michelle and Mark. Welcome to the call. Chris, good seeing you on CNBC last night. I know they let anyone on these days. So nice that they got an upgrade with you. But in all seriousness, good quarter. And you called out space in addition to Aerojet on that segment. Your space business, 1.5 billion of new prime space awards. What types of opportunities are you seeing in the market? And has there been a shift in the competitive backdrop given some of the moves to smaller space systems? And then where do you think LHX is gaining share? And tied to that, there were a number of international awards within Space. Is there a shift in the dynamics that you're seeing just given space has become more open to the US working with allies? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thank you, Sheila. I was actually in Clifton, New Jersey all day with our electronic warfare team. So just a short drive to get on TV. So thank you. Thank you for that. You know, let me kind of kick this off and then I'll ask Michelle to give a little more detail. And I really want to step back and think of space and the space domain and how it aligns with the strategy that we've been talking about since the merger. So a few fun facts that the date of the merger there were actually zero L3Harris or legacy company satellites in orbit. Today, there are seven that we have built, obviously, as a prime and we have 33 in backlog as a prime that will be launched over the next couple of years. So when we look back, we saw this as a growth market several years ago, which it is. We invested R&D and capital and facilities and tooling to position ourselves for growth. And the discussion aligned with what we've been saying for several years was to move up the food chain and become a prime by providing disruptive technologies and alternatives to our customers. And I think as we sit here today, we can see that that strategy, that investment is starting to payoff. We're probably best known recently for the work we're doing with the Missile Defense Agency and the Space Development Agency launches that will be coming up in the next year or so. But we're also a market leader in weather and ISR and also space exploration. And I appreciate you highlighting the fact that we're growing internationally as well. You don't always think of space as an international growth opportunity, but the team has a global reputation of delivering on time and having quality products, and we're seeing that being recognized around the globe. So, Michelle, do you want to maybe give more detail? Michelle Turner : Yeah. So I'll add some color in terms of our strategy and action and some of the numbers, Sheila. So thanks for highlighting this. So over the last six months we have submitted over 7 billion in space proposals, booking a billion and a half within Q1. So we're super excited about this book-to-bill over 2.0 within this sector. Kelly and her team are doing an amazing job in terms of recognizing the current environment within the US. But also to your point, Sheila, around expanding the aperture in terms of international exposure as well. Half of the -- billion and a half in bookings are international in nature. And so when we think about margins within this space, this is where Kelly and the team are thinking differently in terms of leveraging our domestic footprint to be able to drive shareholder value in a different way across the globe. So we're excited about this double-digit growth from a revenue perspective. We expect this to continue to be a tailwind for us within '23 and beyond. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning, Chris, Michelle and Mark. Chris, on the supply chain. It's encouraging to see that the market conditions for electronic components are improving. Your critical parts shortage is declining and alternate parts are increasing. So is this tracking better or worse or as you expected? And if we continue to see the supply chain improvement accelerate, could we see upside to your full year guide beyond the upper end? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thanks, Kristine. I believe the worst is behind us relative to all the macro headwinds we've talked about supply chain attrition and inflation. But to your question specifically on supply chain, you know, I'm proud of the team because these alternative parts just don't happen. We took a fair amount of talent and expense to redesign our products, if you will, design for availability. And the team has done an amazing job. And as we highlighted in our letter, we now have 1300 alternative parts that weren't originally designed into our products. So that's been able to allow us to grow. As you saw in the quarter and maybe position us for continued growth for the rest of the year. I think after the last few years, I hate to predict anything because it's hard to predict what's going to happen day to day or month to month. But I feel real good about the opportunities and the positioning. And we referenced, you know, we've signed a strategic agreement with a major microelectronic chip providing company. The benefit for us is it gives us assured availability and kind of moves us up and out of the allocation process, which is always an uncertainty kind of day by day. And in exchange for that, you know, we're sitting down and sharing with them our technology roadmap and working collaboratively as we design new products, taking advantage of some of their more advanced technologies. So long way of saying we're happy with the first quarter. We have good visibility for Q2 and beyond. And you know, if we continue with this momentum, it's possible we could see outperformance. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Michelle, can you lay out what drove the softer margins in IMS. Michelle Turner : Yeah, absolutely, Scott. Good morning. How are you? Scott Deuschle : IMS and CS this quarter and then walk through the factors that unlocked the implied margin improvement in the second half. And if you can touch on the dynamics with backlog repricing, that would also be very helpful. Thank you. Michelle Turner : So we're getting a little bit of a garbled feedback, Scott, but I think what you're asking about is IMS margins and back half improvement for overall enterprise? Scott Deuschle : Yeah, that's right. Backlog repricing. Thank you. Michelle Turner : Yeah, absolutely. So before I jump into the margins, I just want to kind of set the stage in terms of how we set the expectations for our team within Q1. We really had three objectives. One was to grow top line. The second was to meet our EPS and the third was to improve on our cash position from last year. And we met all three of those. And so to your point. Q1 margins did come in light. They were aligned with expectations, however. And so I think it's important to go back to what we talked about in our last earnings call, where we talked about having a more balanced plan this year. And in terms of revenue and EBIT, the expectations was revenue would be balanced with our first half margins being lower and accelerating in the second half, really driven by two things. One is around our higher margin product deliveries. So as we see the supply chain constraints continue to ease, we expect that our product deliveries are going to continue to improve, which is going to drive margins in the second half of the year. The second is related to our fixed price backlog and we talked about this a little bit in Q4, but aligned with our -- the macro headwinds that have been experienced across the industry and the higher inflationary environment. We experienced this particularly acutely within three of our sectors, which we talked about within the letter EW, IVS and ISR. We expect that this is going to continue to dissipate as we start to see some of the actions that we take -- we took at the end of last year start to pay dividends in the second half of this year. So we have a path to getting to the margins in the second half. And one other thing I would note in terms of Q1 is our Q1 margins were a bit deflated by lumpy aircraft revenue recognition within our ISR business. When you look at this, it's about a 40 to 50 basis point impact within the quarter. So we expect as this normalizes, that's also going to help our EBIT in the second half, the EBIT margins in the second half of the year. And then to your question specifically, Scott, on IMS, there's two pieces there. One is the mix. And for those that have been on this journey with us, you're familiar with our lumpy aircraft revenue recognition. So as I talked about from an enterprise perspective. In Q1, this had this dynamic played out for us. We did recognize the C3D order from the Air Force and as a result that aircraft revenue had an impact in terms of lower margins within the quarter. So we expect that that's going to continue to improve throughout the year as we work on the missionization of those aircraft. The second piece is related to the fixed price backlog that I talked about. This was an acute impact within our ISR business. And so you may remember we talked about attrition concerns that we had in Q4 along with the macro headwinds where we sit today within Q1, we are seeing improvement and we have seen our attrition stabilize and this is good news in terms of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And so we expect that the attrition and the performance is going to stabilize and we'll see less of those negative VAC impacts as we make our way through the year. Chris Kubasik : Yeah, I think I'll just chime on Scott a little bit more. And look none of us are happy where we are in Q1 with the margins, but it's exactly what we had planned. And we clearly have a ramp to get to 15.5 by the end of the year, which we will. You know, we kind of teased out in the letter a little bit about our enterprise transformation. And I just wanted to talk briefly about that. You know, it's actually been less than four years ago that we had the merger. And what I call Phase One was our three year integration, which I highlighted is very, very successful with over 650 million of savings. But that was really just Phase One, right? That was harmonizing the benefits, closing down headquarters, consolidating segments, taking advantage, you know, of the enterprise relative to supply chain rebidding contracts. And, you know, it's water under the bridge, but still proud of what the team was able to accomplish, especially during COVID. So the natural evolution under our continuous improvement mindset is to move into Phase Two. And we've really looked at the success of our trusted disruptor strategy and how it's being embraced by our customers and suppliers, and we're applying it to ourselves. How do we disrupt ourselves and how do we get better and more efficient? So we just completed about a ten-week sprint to highlight and confirm that there are opportunities for us and we're trying to figure out how we're going to function differently and really rethink every function and everything we do. Easy example would be on real estate, especially as we've supported and embraced the remote and hybrid world. We don't need nearly as much office space as we used to, and there's a clear opportunity for savings. We're looking at functional cost. We're looking at what we do. We started using as everybody as I'm sure bots to remove some of the manual labor and actually provide some savings and also our indirect procurement strategy, just to name a few of the things. So now that the sprint is complete. We're in the design phase of the program. And on our next call, we plan to give you some actual tangible numbers and tangible timeframe to show how this is going to make L3Harris an even better company and contributed to our already industry leading margins. So the entire leadership team is excited about this project and I think we're off to a good start and more to come in, you know, 90 days. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning Chris, Michelle and Mark. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Peter Arment : Chris, I wanted to ask on working capital and I'm sure Michelle want to weigh in. I know you've kind of focused on driving the metrics lower over the last few years. And last year you obviously built up some inventory. Maybe you could just update us I know working capital was less of a use this quarter, but maybe whether you think the 53 days that you kind of ended in 2021, is that still something you can target this year? And ultimately do you think you can get into the 40s? Thanks so much. Michelle Turner : Yeah, Peter. The short answer is we expect to get back to the 53, 54 levels by the end of this year. And so what you saw in Q1 were really proud of the teams. We saw working capital improved by about 300 million year-on-year. That's about an eight day improvement from where we were at this point at the end of Q1 '22, really driven by receivables. And I just want to highlight this is a great example of our Performance First initiative in action. So many thanks to our finance program management and contracts teams for implementing what we affectionately call Money Mondays, which is really focused on truncating our billing and invoicing processes to drive a more efficient use of our working capital. As a result, we were able to improve our DSO by two days from the same period last year. And so to your point about getting to the 5, 54 by the end of this year, we have to drive about 300 million of improvement between Q1 and the end of the year. And this is predominantly going to come from inventory. Almost equally split between our product inventory, which is going to be driven by the easing of supply chain constraints being able to ramp our deliveries in the second half of the year, but also around our performance based milestones on some of the new program wins that we have. The space business is a great example of that, where we're negotiating and getting cash up front as a result of some of these new orders. But then also executing on those programs are going to deliver cash for us in the second half as well. Chris Kubasik : And Peter, clearly working capital is a top priority. It's something we briefed our board at each and every meeting. And as we have our monthly reviews, that's something that Michelle, I and the team look at. You know, I don't think it was surprising to see it. The working capital days grow in the last couple of years. You know, we were taking the approach, you know, to get all the parts we could pretty much at any cost, and that resulted in a build-up of inventory. We're much more confident in our ability now to plan and have alternatives to part. So you'll see that contribute as we bring down the working capital days. And if you recall, we were very aggressive and continue to be in negotiating performance based payments versus progress payments and tying the receipt of cash to specific performance milestones. And, you know, I view that as an opportunity. I think it's fair to say there's certain programs that are behind schedule either due to our performance or our suppliers performance. And you know, that's fine. We've identified it and we're working it. And that gives me even further confidence that we'll be able to hit our numbers as we continue to perform and tie the cash to those milestones. So thanks for the question, Peter. Operator : The next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. As you work through the process on Aerojet Rocketdyne, how are you thinking about divestitures at this point? Things stand out that light commercial aircraft, simulation and training, public safety. So how are you thinking about kind of the timing of when you might do a divestiture, what the size might be, and how do you decide what fits? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Well, good morning, Doug. And yeah, we've talked about the need to divest to generate cash to help fund the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. So, yeah, we're not going to actually disclose what we've decided is non-core, but we have a regular process to review our portfolio and see as the company evolves, we're becoming more and more of a government or defense contractor. So we want things that align with the rest of the portfolio where we have synergies and the ability to share technologies and processes. We closed a real small one for 70 million, but for the larger ones, there's a process going on. We wanted to get through the first quarter right to update with current financial results and show that these are good if not great businesses. And it's the usual analysis, you know, we have good businesses and they're better owners for those businesses. We're not at all in a fire sale situation. We're going to take our time and we're going to get the maximum value for those properties. And, you know, I'd hope we could probably sign and announce something this year, maybe close one in Q4 or early 2024. But we'll run a process. We get a lot of inbound calls, especially after something like this, where I say what I just said, but there's interest in our portfolio. I'll just leave it at that and I'm confident we'll be able to get some proceeds. And I think I've previously said about $1 billion of proceeds from this process, meaning two or three divestitures. So I'll stay committed to that number. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global Research. Please proceed with your question. Richard Safran : Chris, Michelle, Mark, good morning. How are you? If it's okay, I'd like to return to the subject of bookings and the 1.3 book-to-bill you did in the quarter. I thought you might talk about full year bookings expectations. And then if we start to think longer term period of growth and the opportunity set, I was kind of wondering if you what you're thinking about if book-to-bill should be better than one in this growth period? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I mean, we always set our internal goals and aspirations to be more than 101 on book-to-bill. It's kind of hard to grow if you're not booking more orders than the revenue you're recognizing. I think the 1.3 was -- is absolutely a great way to start the year. When we talked last time, you know, this is the impact of a continuing resolution, right. And, until the CR gets broken loose, which it did, we start to see the money flow. And as I've said before, the only one who dislikes the CR more than industry is the Department of Defense. So I think we're off to a really good start. The President's budget request of $842 billion is 3% growth, as you know, Rich. And when you peel it back 4% on the investment accounts, you couple that with what we've been able to do internationally the last several years, the interest in the TCOM, the Space International, you would clearly expect that we'll be over 10 for book-to-bill for the year. And aspirationally I'd like to be at least 105 and maybe even 11. But it's somewhat lumpy, right, as you know. And it depends on we only talk and record the funded backlog. So that always has a little bit of a difference maybe relative to other companies. But we're feeling really, really good. And I think the key message here is, you know, this just confirms that, that our strategy is working and the customers appreciate and recognize what we're trying to do. Sometimes, we have more innovative solutions. The focus is on speed and schedule and cost. So we kind of mix those in and they've been pretty aggressive in pursuing different markets and different technologies. I will also say that Michelle and I and the team spent a lot of time focused on risk management and we had two opportunities in the quarter that were pretty exciting to us. But when the final RFP came out, there were fixed price development with fixed priced options and we chose not to bid those for obvious reasons. It's very hard to commit to a fixed price development program when you don't know the spec. I think we all look back at all the write-offs and losses and more times than not they're tied to that. So we will not be playing that game. I've elevated it to what I think is the highest levels within the Pentagon and the RFP has come out. We're not going to bid. And I would think over time others aren't going to bid. And ultimately we'll go back to the appropriate contracting vehicle for the appropriate opportunity. So kind of a roundabout answer there, Rich, but I wanted to cover a few of those -- a few of those points. I guess I'll just maybe throw in the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, by all accounts, and it's not always easy to look and compare apples-to-apples, but the munitions line in '24 appears to be at least 20% higher than '23. So I think we all know the need and the desire for these munitions for not only current threats, but future threats in addition to refilling the stockpile. So I think the acquisition in December made a heck of a lot of sense. And I think when you look at the budget, it makes even more sense. So I'll just leave it at that. Michelle Turner : And Rich just to add, international part of this, 30% of our 5.8 billion of record order within the quarter were international and the book-to-bill was over 1.5 for international. So really speaks to what Chris was alluding to in terms of the strategies working. Operator : The next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe kind of a number of things, Chris, but maybe just to go back to Aerojet, pretty well publicized about some of the capacity challenges and production challenges they're having. They just got this award from the DoD for $215 million to enhance their capabilities in production. I guess one of the overhangs or concerns out there was how much cash you guys were going to have to invest in that business. So clearly this potentially alleviates your CapEx. But I guess I'm trying to figure out, when can you guys start working together? Do you have to wait for this to close? Because I would imagine you guys would want to have some strategic input in terms of how they're building out or investing into the facilities to ramp up production. And I guess, just also staying on Aerojet, you mentioned divestitures. And I just wondered, does the -- do the big lower space engines fit in your portfolio? Or when you talk about these divestitures, can something fall out of Aerojet? Chris Kubasik : Let me try to address them. Yes, relative to working together, there's some pretty clear rules that are called gun jumping, and we're very conscious, as is Aerojet Rocketdyne, not to trip over those thresholds. So we cannot actually work together and help them relative to the DPA money. We're aware of it. We have the ability to review the documents. But Eileen is running her company, I'm running my company. And until we close, we can't really change that. And that's been around forever with all acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, but all the more reason to get this transaction approved in a timely manner so that we can start working on that. The Defense Production Act, DPA, it's actually been around since the '50s. So this is a pile of money, a bucket of money that the DoD has, and it's really there to help strengthen the resiliency of the defense industrial base. And with the focus on manufacturing and capability of these key technologies, I was pleased to see that they received this money. I know the team has been working on this for probably a year there at Aerojet Rocketdyne. It's unrelated to the acquisition. But it is in support of their growth. It highlights to me the critical nature of these technologies and the DoD need for this company to be successful. And this money, I view, as maybe a little more tactical relative to increasing both the physical and the digital infrastructure of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our acquisition being more less tactical and more strategic will assure a strong industrial base, a more viable competitor. And I think it's great news for Aerojet Rocketdyne and great news for the Department of Defense. And I'm pretty sure they have pretty thorough plans and a competent leadership team on how best to spend this money to optimize both capacity, digital engineering and moving a couple of production lines for the growth that we talked about. So relative to the divestitures, yes, we're not -- everything I was talking about would be legacy L3Harris. So clearly, the space propulsion space once the deal closes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Peter Skibitski : Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, guys, maybe Michele on capital allocation, as Chris alluded to in his remarks, you guys went pretty heavy on repurchases to start the year, pretty close to your $0.5 billion target for the full year. How are you thinking about allocation now on the balance of the year? Because I know you do have some debt maturing this summer, I think. So do you look to address that? Or are you looking at other options? Thanks. Michelle Turner : Good morning, Pete. So we don't anticipate any changes to our previous commentary in terms of capital allocation. Longer term, we expect to have a fairly balanced approach, and we've added some color to this within our investor letter in terms of buybacks, dividends and acquisitions. To your point about the Aerojet acquisition, we do anticipate that still closing this year. And as a result, our leverage ratio will get close to 4, with about $14 billion of debt. And so we are targeting over the next couple of years to bring that back down to below 3. So for this year, we're anticipating still the $500 million of share buybacks. So another $100 million to go based on the $400 million that we did within Q1, along with the dividends being consistent with what we previously communicated. In terms of the debt, we do expect to pay that down within June. And so you should see that play out consistent with what we shared before. Operator : The next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Hello? Michelle Turner : Hi, Rob. Can you hear us? Robert Stallard : I can hear you. Okay, sorry. Good morning, guys. So just to maybe wrap things up on the whole Aerojet topic. Let's assume things do get done, the deal is completed in the second half of this year, do you anticipate any further significant M&A in the medium-term time frame? Chris Kubasik : Yes. I think that's an easy one, Rob. So just picking up where Michelle left off, the answer would be no. We'll have close to $13 billion, $14 billion of debt. And as we've said previously, we'll be using our free cash flow to reduce that debt to maintain our investment credit rating. So no. No is the answer. And a couple of years down the road, we can relook at that. But we want to keep a strong balance sheet, focus on execution. We really -- going back to December, there were three things that were a challenge, whether reality or perceived, and that was how could you integrate ViaSat, fix your operational issues and buy Aerojet Rocketdyne at the same time. I'm pleased to report on ViaSat that the integration is going well. It looks like both the revenue and the cost synergies will meet or exceed our business case, so that is exciting. We're about six months ahead of schedule relative to consolidating facilities. We have a four phase process. So the risk of moving is reasonably low. We're in the middle of the first phase. So we'll basically take the four major product lines one by one and that could be done by the end of this calendar year, which again is ahead of schedule. And the customer feedback and the interactions has been real exciting relative to these new capabilities. And we talked briefly about Link 16 in Space. And I'm pleased to say for the first time ever, Link 16 is in space, based on some recent payloads that were launched. So probably a little early to say that ViaSat is done, but it's on a really good track. And I would think we kind of have that behind us. I think on the operational challenges, again, really proud of this team in this quarter. It feels like we've turned the corner. A lot of this -- and I know it was -- nobody wanted to keep hearing about the products and 25% and revenue recognition and such, but it was unique compared to the rest of the industry. And now that we're getting the supplies in, we're redesigning products. You're seeing that in the top line and you'll see that in the bottom line as well. And then by the time the deal closes, the focus for my team and others will be on Aerojet Rocketdyne. So January 1, a lot of questions, a lot of uncertainty, and I think we're knocking these issues out one by one over a 12-month period. And by the time we get to '24, we're going to have a lot of momentum behind us. So I hope that helps. Maybe we have time for -- looks like one last question or -- that was it. All right. No other questions in the queue. Chris Kubasik : So look I appreciate everybody participating and calling in and asking the questions. And we look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead. Have a great weekend. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Mark Kratz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. During our discussion, we may reference the investor letter that we published to the website yesterday. As always, this call will primarily be focused on answering questions. As you can imagine, given the news, we have a busy day. So we're going to hold the call to 40 minutes this morning. I will be available throughout the day for follow-ups. During the call, we may discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference the safe harbor provision found in the investor letter and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the investor letter. Lastly, we conducted an investor perception study in the second quarter and we recently reviewed the results with the Board. I want to thank those who participated and we are incorporating your feedback. Before moving to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday marked a significant milestone for L3Harris in our acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our investor letter disclosed that the FTC will not block our acquisition. This is one of the final closing conditions for the transaction, and we are moving forward to close in the next day or so. I look forward to extending a warm welcome to Aerojet's team of over 5,000 employees who will soon become part of L3Harris. This acquisition represents a pivotal moment for both our company and the defense industry and is poised to generate shareholder value beyond initial expectations. Budgets are increasing for munitions, and the DoD has committed DPA, Defense Production Act, funding for the expansion and modernization of Aerojet Rocketdyne's operations. Upon closing, this acquisition will strengthen the defense industrial base, foster healthy competition and accelerate innovation in support of the war fighter. In conjunction with this exciting news, we continue to focus on execution across the enterprise and have delivered on our financial commitments again in second quarter. Our results reflect the momentum we have been building over the last year, as the team delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of top-line growth which accelerated to 13% with increases in each segment. We don't talk much about our sectors, but 13 of the 14 grew their top-line in Q2 and 13 of 14 had a book-to-bill greater than 1.0. This gives me confidence that we've been investing in the right technologies, and we are aligned with customer priorities. Operating income was up 7% and margins expanded 50 basis points sequentially as we had anticipated. In total, we delivered earnings of $2.95 -- $2.97 per share, ahead of consensus and free cash flow was positive, in line with prior commentary at over $300 million. Given our performance to-date, we are increasing revenue and EPS guidance for the year and reiterating our free cash flow commitment. With easing supply chain constraints, operational improvement initiatives, and accelerating sequential growth in product-centric businesses, we remain focused on delivering second half results for 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions, Rob. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yes, thanks. Good morning, Chris, Michelle and Mark. Chris, congratulations on the Aerojet deal. If it's okay, I wanted to kind of focus on that, just versus asking a question about the quarter. But maybe to start, maybe you could just give us high levels, walk us through kind of the go-forward plan on Aerojet and did you have to sign any consent agreements and any comments you would like talk about on integration would be helpful. Thanks again. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thanks Peter. Just as a reminder, we announced -- signed and announced the deal back in December. We received our second request in mid-March. And here we are 7.5 months later, ready to close the transaction. So it really was a great team effort. I'm not sure everyone appreciates how much time and effort it takes to go through that process. So a special call-out to the L3Harris team, because all because this was in addition to their day jobs. The IT organization going back years, searching emails, text, legal, finance, contracts and a lot of our external partners. So very proud of the team to be where we are in a relatively pretty -- pretty short period of time. It was a very thorough review by the FTC as you can imagine and obviously the DoD, Department of Defense, would have had some input. So we responded to all inquiries and we are where we are today. So we put out that announcement as the -- as the waiting period has expired yesterday. Over the next day or so, we have to finalize the financing and then close the transaction. And I think we're going to be in a good shape to hit the ground running. Relative to your question about the consent agreement, we did not negotiate or sign a consent agreement. We gave assurances to the DoD that we would be a merchant supplier of rocket motors and rocket engines We have a long legacy of being a merchant supplier and we'll continue with that model once we close Aerojet Rocketdyne. I can assure you we are highly motivated to sell rocket engines and rocket motors to anyone who wants to buy them within the rules globally. So some of the theories that were bounced around never made a heck of a lot of sense to me to be honest to you. We bought this company to sell engines and motors and that's what we're going to do. We'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We did have integration office with representatives from both teams. So a lot of time and effort on planning and, again, given the L3Harris merger, we had a playbook that we will use. This is obviously an acquisition, but every function, every decision has been made. We're ready to go on day one. So, thanks, Peter. Appreciate the kind comments. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much. Good morning everyone and, yeah, congratulations, Chris and Michelle. Maybe I'll just continue along the Aerojet line here. I guess, Chris, it kind of seems to me that the defense department has had a problem sourcing solid rocket motors and L3Harris has kind of raised their hand and volunteered to help solve that problem. So now it's going to get solved. And so, as you think about Aerojet, and we've seen various complaints from their customers over the years on kind of a perceived lack of investment, if you could talk to us about how you plan to address those issues, both from an operational standpoint and then from an investment standpoint, I think, we've all seen the $215 million that they got. I think that's focused primarily on GMLRS, Javelin and Stinger, but there's also Standard Missile, PAC-3, THAAD? So thinking about those programs as well and what the investment requirements are. Chris Kubasik : Okay. No, again, thanks, Seth. Yeah, we did raise our hands, but to help. We had a pretty active M&A process and there were several companies or a handful of companies that we thought made a lot of sense. And one of those, of course, was the TDL line of ViaSat and of course Aerojet Rocketdyne. And as I've said before, and I know there was feedback, it was kind of unusual that both properties came to market in the same quarter. So it fits in strategically in my opinion. So we're always available to help the DoD, but the strategic rationale for Aerojet Rocketdyne continues to be entry into new markets. These are growth markets as you well know, with -- especially on the weapons side and it's well aligned with the government priorities, I already mentioned. From when we announced it to where we are today, significant increases in in the budget. And as you mentioned, the DPA money was over and above maybe what we had planned. So I think that makes a lot of sense. We've been impressed as we've gone out to the sites, with the talent and the skill of the workforce at these sites and as you would expect, the majority of those key individuals, hopefully all of them will be staying with the merger. And again, as of last night, the top 100 or so individuals we identified, over 98% have agreed to stay with the company. So I was excited to see that. I think hypersonics is going to be a capability that is very exciting. It doesn't get a whole lot of press, but longer term, when I look at where things are headed, I think the -- or soon to be our capability in hypersonics, that actually sounds pretty good. Our hypersonic capability is going to be a differentiator and I think continue to disrupt the market. We used to answer lots of questions about the backlog and whether we're short cycled, long cycled, but this clearly brings some long cycle backlog to L3Harris, gives us more earnings visibility. And the business case that we laid out back in December with accretion of EPS and free cash flow in the first full year and first full second year continue to remain in place or maybe slightly better. So relative to your question on operations, we obviously comply with the rules. There's this concept known as gun jumping, which is something you don't want to do. So we did not gun jump, which means we really couldn't get too involved in their businesses. But through the diligence process, we were able to engage with their team. They have a plan to go forward that we've reviewed. It's a real focus on deliveries and quality of critical missile programs. You mentioned a fair amount of those. And most of that surrounds the modernization of the Camden, Arkansas production operations and expanding production across other sites. And as you mentioned, the DPA, the $215 million, we've looked at that plan. That money will go mainly to those facilities and the programs you mentioned, but there\u2019s also money in there to digitize their engineering. So we're quite excited about that. So we've developed some tools since the merger to improve operations and processes. We utilize capability modeling, we have zero defect planning, just as a couple of examples. So we're going to take those processes and merge them into what Aerojet has and we'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We'll be at the key sites and we have a plan to execute. It's going to take some time you would imagine, but they're excited about the acquisition. We're excited about it. And in next 48 hours or so, we just want to close it and get ready to go from there. So, thanks, Seth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Hi, good morning. Chris Kubasik : Good morning. Michelle Turner : Hey, good morning. Robert Spingarn : Sticking with the topic at hand, I wanted to ask a financial question. Given that you've just updated guidance, but yet you're going to close this in the next day or two, I was wondering, Chris, if either you or Michelle could talk about the guidance with Aerojet included for the rest of the year both from a P&L perspective and then just maybe to follow on to Seth's question on the CapEx or investment perspective for the rest of '23? And then in that CapEx vein, how you think about that long term? Michelle Turner : Yeah. So I'll start, Rob. Good morning and thanks for joining. So as Chris pointed out, we're focused on closing the deal first and then welcoming all the new AeroJet employees for the day one celebratory event. So we certainly are going to get to the guide. We do plan to update the guidance in October for the five months remaining as part of our Q3 earnings call. And then of course for 2024, that'll part of our January update consistent with the rest of our portfolio. Once we have officially closed, we will be reviewing the forecasts and the assumptions, but high level, we do anticipate revenue to be around $1 billion for the remainder of the year, but we don't anticipate a material contribution to earnings as we anticipate the income contribution will offset the interest expense from the incremental debt. To Chris' point around the value creation, I do just want to remind everybody what we had shared previously which is consistent with where we stand today. EPS accretion within year one, along with free cash flow within year two. Chris Kubasik : Again, I think we'll give more and more details at -- let\u2019s hit the next -- at the next earnings call. We will have two months of actual results, and we can give guidance for the remainder of the year, which of course is only three more months. And I think it's all about January of '24 when we give guidance for \u201824 for L3Harris. And this will be a separate segment, as we've said before, so you'll have visibility to growth and the profitability for all four segments. And I was going to mention this at the end, but I know there's several calls going on. So I'll just do it now. We are going to have a Investor Day in December, something that we've wanted to do, but we didn't want to schedule until we had confidence that the deal was going to close. So we'll get something out here in the weeks ahead on a date and a location. But at that time, we're going to give you a deeper insight to Aerojet Rocketdyne update and refresh how our Trusted Disruptor strategy is performing and then some of the other organic growth drivers that we have in our portfolio. So more to come, but we look forward to seeing hopefully everybody in person in December. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Doug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Chris Kubasik : Good morning, Doug. Doug Harned : Yeah, I want to switch gears a little bit here. When -- if you look at where a lot of things are going right now in DoD and elsewhere, with the TDL acquisition, in principle, having Link 16 combined with other assets you've got in comms, space, IMS, it should put you in a pretty interesting position to provide some really integrated system solutions. Now, I'm just interested in how you see the opportunity there, how large could that be if in fact you see that? And then trying to -- assuming you do, trying to make that work, how do you go after something when this is a company that historically you've operated in many small silos as businesses and this would involve really an integrated approach that I don't think we've seen so much in the past here? Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thanks, Doug. Yeah, a lot of questions there. Look, I think the bottom line here is the TDL acquisition is really looking better than maybe we had expected. It's probably too early to declare success, but we're off to a real strong start. I'll just pick up on the operations first and then get to your more strategic question. But part of the plan was to integrate and move the production to Salt Lake City, where we have our BCS, Broadband Communication Systems, sector headquartered, which will co-locate these properties. So as of today, we've actually moved more than half of the production lines successfully. We're slightly ahead of schedule, which is always good. And we've already built first articles with no issues related to the production lines that we've moved. So we kind of expected that to be the case, but it's never easy to move a production line or several production lines, but that's going better than planned and actually more employees have agreed to relocate than we had planned for, which I think is contributing to the success. Sam Mehta, our segment President, and I will be out there next week for a few days and topics you're talking about are clearly on the agenda. I think on an integrated approach, our company does this probably better than anyone. We've had some successes over the last year or so on some significant classified programs, on Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, on SPEAR for the Navy and each and every one of these have in excess of seven or eight different L3Harris entities working collaboratively across multiple segments. So we think all the challenges the companies have working internally, whether it's the internal accounting, the cost transfer, who gets credit for the bonuses, all the reasons why people have a hard time working collaboratively, we've been able to fix. And I think that's really set us up well for exactly what you're talking about. I mean, the customer interest has been very, very strong. And most of the discussions have focused on how we integrate the BCS waveforms with the Link 16 capabilities. We talked about Link 16 having the footprint in over 20,000 platforms. So the boxes to put it crudely are already there and it's just a matter of taking those capabilities and integrating them and then also possibly enhancing the Link 16 capabilities. I think, while that sounds like a lot of words, what we were excited about and we put in the investor letter is that near the end of the quarter, we won, specifically TDL, a $150 million competitive Prime award for MIDS, and MIDS is the Multifunctional Information Distribution System as part of the Joint Tactical Radio program. This was the largest production order ever. It's about three times larger than anything we've ever received. And I think that's tangible example of the customer excitement and the capabilities. Obviously, we have strong backlog as a result of that order in that one business. And as I said, I couldn't be more pleased with this acquisition and still more to do, but everything is looking good so far. So hopefully that helps, Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Sure. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. Thank you. I want to ask specifics on margins in the quarter and how we think about the second half. So I guess first up on Q2, CS performance was pretty good, tracking ahead of your full year. How do we think about mix benefits, the normalization of supply chain and the sustainability of 25% plus margins in CS? And then additionally, if you could dig into the operational items within IMS and what drives the sequential step-up in the second half? Thank you. Michelle Turner : Good morning, Sheila, and thanks for the question. So I will start with our overall enterprise margins and then peel the onion a bit from a segment perspective because there's a lot of good work that's happening across the portfolio. So to your point, our Q2 margins did come in at 14.8%. This is a 50 basis point improvement from Q1. And I just want to note that this is also consistent with what we've previously communicated in terms of sequential margin improvement expected throughout the year. And this will land us in a place from our updated guidance of getting us to our 15% expectations, which again continues to be industry-leading in terms of margin performance. One thing I want to highlight from a overall portfolio perspective is, key to this result within Q1 and it's also going to drag over the last couple of years is our overall EAC performance. And this is important because 75% of our portfolio is driven by programs, right, which is driven by EACs. And so it impacts our bottom line So aligned with this, Q2 was the first quarter that we saw our EAC trend trajectory start to improve since the second half of 2021. So you may recall this is when the macro environment challenges started across all industries. It started to permeate within supply chain, then we saw the issues with labor and inflation that permeated throughout 2022. And so where we sit today, specifically within CS, and kudos to Sam Mehta and the CS team delivered really strong margins within the quarter, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1, really driven by all the resilient supply chain actions that we've taken. You've heard us talk about this over the last 12 to 18 months, but also the easing of the electronic component shortages and we also have the benefit of increased software mix within the quarter. So really strong delivery for Q2. As we look at full year, we expect second half for CS to be consistent with the first half with Q3 being a bit lighter in terms of domestic mix with that ramping within fourth quarter. From a IMS perspective, we did continue to see an impact from increased domestic ISR mix. This, along with some operational challenges on fixed price development programs at a couple of our remote sites permeated and had an impact within the quarter. Jon Rambeau and our IMS team are addressing these issues. They are predominantly related to talent and learning loss inefficiencies and we expect the results of these actions to have a positive impact as we progress towards the end of the year. In regards to the second half ramp, again, this is consistent in terms of the initial guidance that we laid out, but it's really driven by two things. One is around this continual improvement in terms of EAC performance. As I noted, we saw this start to trend upward within Q2. We expect that trend to continue as we are working through that fixed price backlog that has been impacted by these macro issues over the last 12 to 18 months. And the second is driven by our product deliveries. Consistent with what we've experienced in the past, we expect our product deliveries to be higher in the second half, high single digits, which is going to be able to deliver on the margin expectations. The other thing I would note is within Q4, we do have a higher mix of our international product sales and so you'll see this play out both within TCOM and Wescam. So from a modeling perspective, expect that fourth quarter margins are going to be better than Q3. Chris Kubasik : I'll just chime in. I think we try to highlight within IMS, the challenges on these few select programs were within the ISR and the maritime sectors. I will say that there continues to be a lot of demand for those products and capabilities. We do a fair amount of undersea test ranges for the US Navy and we've been successful in winning work just recently for the similar capability in Australia. We've talked about Compass Call here for the US Air Force. There's similar capabilities for a European country that will be mainly focused on modernizing the aircraft, which will have higher margins since the aircraft have already been procured. We're continuing to pursue undersea test range and sensing capability here in the US Navy, kind of a follow-on to something that we started winning four or five years ago. We've talked about the business jets and the strategy years ago to start missionizing business jets. We have an opportunity to far east, we have another opportunity in Europe. And then here in the US, you saw that we won the ATHENA-R program, which we're very excited about. I think the other day we announced that we're teaming with another OEM on ATHENA-S. We'd kind of hope to win one of the two and now we're going to go two for two. And then the Army has a program known as HADES, which could be up to 10 aircraft. So there's a lot of opportunities and how I want to tie this back to the margins is IMS has the longer cycle backlog relative to the other businesses, say, CS in particular. They have a lot of fixed price contract, probably some fixed price development programs, which I think I've publicly said we're really going to be selective on bidding going forward, especially when the customer is asking for a fixed price production or low rate production, simultaneous with development, that's just bad business and makes no sense and we're going to continue to push back and not bid those because very hard to price something that you haven't developed. But I have discussions on that topic regularly with our customers and we will continue to no-bid those until the contracting vehicle is appropriate. So I throw that in that some of these challenges which Michelle laid out well is really the lagging effect of attrition and inflation because of the long cycle business. We've taken those lessons that we've learned or we've more bluntly or clearly updated these bids based on the latest performance, the latest cost. So every single program I mentioned is double digit and sometimes more than double digit margins or higher double digit. So we'll get those wins, we'll get those in backlog that gives me confidence that we'll be able to improve the margins in IMS with Jon and his team. Michelle Turner : Yeah. The only other thing I would add to that is just as a reminder, when we set out our guidance this year, we were purposeful of not including any international buying or events, we still have a strong pipeline that we're chasing there, just the recognition that we know we've disappointed historically when we put those in and then not been able to get them over the goal line because of their timing constraints. And so we continue to have a strong backlog there with our pipeline as we look into 2024 and beyond. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Pete Skibitski : Hey, good morning, guys. Michelle Turner : Good morning. Pete Skibitski : Chris, I was wondering if you could add more color on strong first half book-to-bill at space in particular. And I know you guys have obviously done well with some of the low earth orbit awards, but seems like there's a lot of other things going on for you in space as well. So wondering if you could talk more about what you're winning there and kind of your approach, how you're winning it and how big the opportunity set is there? Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thanks, Pete. We talk about this Trusted Disruptor strategy at the L3Harris level. And as you would expect, it really flows down to each and every one of the sectors. And I mentioned we have 14 sectors When we close Aerojet Rocketdyne, we'll be up to 16 sectors as they'll have two sectors within that segment. But it's hard to think of a better example than maybe space where they've really been able to embrace this strategy and execute upon it. And at the highest level, we talk about doing more prime work with the end users, being more innovative, being more agile. I know it just sounds like buzzwords, but it's clearly working in space. And to back it up, at the time of the merger, we had five satellites, mainly experimental demo satellites under contract. And today, we have over 50 contracts for satellites. I mean, that's a 10x in four years, which I think reinforces to what's implied in your question that what we're doing is working. We actually have two classified operational constellations. Again, five years ago, we didn't have any. We might have had parts on other people's satellites on their constellation. So we really have disrupted this market and we're viewed as a prime and a legitimate competitor and we're winning and we're performing. We've invested a fair amount in R&D to get us in this position in capital. We're actually facilitating, we have two facilities, one in Fort Wayne, Indiana that we expanded and one here down in Palm Bay, Florida satellite manufacturing. So we're investing capital for growth, which will allow us to continue to perform. I mean, just since the merger, our revenue is up in space alone over 50%. We have record backlog, we have solid execution. We can always do better. We've had some challenges with certain suppliers. We don't call anybody out by name, but we just kind of work with those -- with those companies to bring them along. So in the space world, it all comes down to launches. We have a bunch of launches coming up in October and that's where the money hits the road. We're excited about a launch we have, the co-manifested payloads, both our SDA tranche 0 satellites will be going up with the MDA's HBTSS satellite. So I think that worked out real well. Upcoming opportunities, we do a lot of work going back decades for NOAA for their weather satellites, about $700 million opportunity coming up this year. We feel really good about that. It's called the sounder program. As always, a lot of classified opportunities, which I know is never satisfying for you and others to hear, Pete, but they are there. The SDA tranche 2 for tracking, the RFP is coming out. So we'll be prepared to respond there. And I think at the end of the day, you hear me talk a lot about prioritization and aligning with customers' needs. Secretary Kendall at the Air Force, their number one operating imperative is all about space. So we have the mission sets. We have the phenomenologies. We've adapted to the rapid acquisition process and we've been quite successful. So couldn't be more proud of the team. And it's just one example where the strategy has been laid out, it's been executed and it's working. So, more to come. Michelle Turner : I would just add to that, because along with the top-line, this team is also fully embracing our performance-first initiative. They're also driving really strong cash performance as well. So nine day working capital improvement within -- from Q1 to Q2. And so kudos to Ed and Kelly in the space team because it's -- sometimes it's easier to grow the top-line without doing the cash along with it and they fully embraced all the financial metrics to really drive this business. Mark Kratz : Rob, in the interest of time and to stop at 40 minutes, we'll go ahead and take the last question this morning. Operator : Our final question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I wanted to ask about TDL, at the sales and the margin side, I think the sales year-to-date since you've rounded it down [about 10%] (ph), did the MIDS contract you mentioned turn that around, get you back above a $400 million sort of run rate where you acquired it? And then on the margin side, if I strip out some of the market loss making contracts, the margins look a bit light. Is there a case for a significant margin expansion once those MIDS drop in? Thanks. Chris Kubasik : Yeah. Thanks, Myles. Good questions. Yeah, we see a path to $400 million or more of revenue for TDL. It was a little bit of a slower start. But with the MIDS win I mentioned and some of the other opportunities we're pursuing, we definitely see a second half ramp coming with MIDS. I think this is lot number 11. So it's been a long production cycle as we've mentioned, a long legacy program. And I think same, similarly on the margins. As part of the move, we're going to have some efficiencies, not only in labor, but overhead and facilities. So we'll start to see the synergies, if you will, kick in and further upward margin potential. And again, this will all be mainly in our Salt Lake City. It's all about base and the ability to win new programs. I'll also throw in there that one of my programs, I've talked about for years Next Gen Jammer, that work would be done in Salt Lake City as well. And that's been a several year process as you know. There was an independent review team that finally came out with their report with no substantive changes. We've turned in our proposal and we're hoping to hear by the end of September. So I just throw that in Myles because it's in the same facility and gives us a larger base, if you will, to absorb the overhead, thereby creating other opportunities for margin expansion. So thank you very much. Chris Kubasik : I guess with that, we'll just wrap up the call. Again, apologies to cut it a little bit short, but Mark and his team will be available all day. And, Michelle and I have to go work some acquisition related tasks as I hope you can appreciate. So thanks for dialing in. And again, we'll get you more information about the Investor Day in December and have a great rest of the week. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to L3Harris Technologies Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin. Mark Kratz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us to discuss third quarter results. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. Yesterday, we published our investor letter detailing our results, guidance and key company updates. So this morning's call will be focused on answering questions. As always, we may discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our provision found in our investor letter and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the investor letter. I'd now like to turn it over to Chris for some brief remarks. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know you've all had a busy week, and we appreciate you joining us this morning. The current events in the Middle East remind us that what we do at L3Harris matters. And the industry in which we operate is more critical than ever before. As a national security technology focused company, we remain committed to supporting the U.S. and its allies to deter aggression and foster stability around the world. As we embark on our fifth year since the merger of L3 and Harris, I'm proud of our achievements. We built a diverse and seasoned team that is integrating our company. L3Harris is viewed as a disruptive competitor that is reshaping the U.S. Defense industrial base. Meanwhile, underpinning our strategy is a focus on operational excellence, delivering quality products on time, driving costs out of our system, and focusing our portfolio as a national security company. This ultimately benefits our customers and creates long-term value for our shareholders. While the macro environment has been challenging, we are making considerable progress. The business is on solid footing, and we are building operational momentum. In the third quarter, we reported 16% top-line growth, the second consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement and strong cash generation, resulting in more than 100% free cash flow conversion. This extends our trend of generating positive free cash flow in each of the quarters since the merger. The team and I look forward to providing more details on our strategy and our 2024 outlook at our Investor Day in December. And with that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Kristine Liwag : You know Chris, Michelle, after owning Aerojet Rocketdyne now for a few months. Are there any surprises to the positive or negative that you've seen? Chris Kubasik : Okay, well, I expected an Aerojet question. So let me take this one and try to answer your question and maybe give a little more insight on Aerojet Rocketdyne. But just to refresh everyone's memory, we signed and announced the deal back in December. And we're able to close it in seven and a half months, which I think is pretty impressive in this environment. So either there was support or probably no objections, obviously from industry and in the Department of Defense to allow the acquisition to go through. So probably closed a little quicker than we expected. I think when we announced that we said it could take up to 12 months, but we did hit the ground running on day one. Deployed the L3Harris leadership team to run the business which I thought was critical to the success that we're going to realize. I'll say from an integration perspective, all was going well, we're clearly on track to get the 40 million to 50 million of cost savings that we talked about previously. We've shut down the Aerojet Rocketdyne headquarters in California. We're ready for January 1 to transition all the employees to L3Harris payroll system benefits and such. The IT team is already connected all the network. So the communication and such is working well. And we obviously have a little longer term IT strategy to optimize the business from that perspective. I will say the workforce, we actually did a survey of the workforce about a month ago, and the results were actually off the charts. I was more than pleased to see the enthusiasm of the workforce, the confidence that they have in being part of L3Harris, the alignment of being a part of a larger company that's focused on defense and national security and space. So that's encouraging to get those types of results. So we've been clear, at least internally and hopefully, externally, that our number one priority is to increase the deliveries, specifically in the rocket motor sector. So everything we're doing is focused on increased deliveries, and we developed the plan. Myself and the leadership team has reviewed it and we're off executing on it, includes having Centers of Excellence for [indiscernible], separately, and I think that's going to help with production and flow and deliveries. We've supplemented the existing leadership teams at some of the key locations in Alabama, Arkansas and Virginia with resources and experience that I think is going to start showing immediate results. And then, we've deployed resources to our sub-tier suppliers. And that really is the challenge in the munitions and rocket motor business is a couple of levels down. And we only have, in some cases, 1 or 2 certified suppliers of cases and igniters and sometimes nozzles. So that is ultimately a choke point that we need to focus on as an industry and as a country. The DPA, you've heard us talk about the Defense Production Act, the over $200 million that was awarded earlier this year. That's focused on 3 main products. We have a plan, and we're starting to execute upon that. In fact, we just leased a building in Alabama, so that we can modify and order the equipment to increase capacity at that facility. So we'll use that as a framework. We're going to revitalize the business, and we'll use that for the other products that weren't necessarily covered by the DPA money. So all of this will contribute to 2024 starting to see a ramp-up in the output, and I would expect to have noticeable improvements by the end of 2024 and then continuing into 2025. We've had discussions, I've had discussions with our end customers. different military services, and they are very excited to have L3Harris own this asset. Obviously, they see us as the answer to the challenges and problems that they and the industry has had relative to rocket motors and we have their full support, which I expected, but is also encouraging. We don't talk too much, but we should about the space engine business. And that's maybe about 1/3 of Aerojet Rocketdyne, that business is operating well. The RL10 engine, which is the upper stage is performing flawlessly. I think the run of successes goes back decades without a failure. And it's not even sure, ever has failed. So that's great news. We're excited to be on the United Launch Alliance, ULA first Vulcan launch and subsequent launches. So there's 2 RL10s per launch. And as of today, we have over 150 in backlog. So that gives us pretty good visibility and stability into the space side. So that's kind of operationally where we are relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Kristine. But I also want to step back on the strategic rationale for the acquisition. It hasn't quite been a year, but I know people are still asking questions. But at L3Harris, we, as I said, are building a defense-focused, technology-focused company. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're looking to acquire businesses that are aligning with our nation's defense strategy and in growing markets. And then, we're divesting those businesses that don't necessarily align with our strategy but are still good businesses but not part of our focus. So Aerojet Rocketdyne is growing faster than the legacy L3Harris business. I think when we look at everything that has happened since we signed the deal in December, there should be no dispute to demand for these products as they flow through the primes in most cases, is up significantly in the U.S. and in the world, which is why we need to focus on the increase in output. And I already mentioned the DPA money of $200 million, which will help us on these 3 particular lines, increased capacity, move production lines and digitize the engineering. So the tailwinds are there as well. So feel better about the acquisition today than I did in December to be honest with you. And I think it's highlighting my last point, some of the challenges in the industry. Going back to the '80s and the peace time dividend, the industry contracted, our capacity contracted. We're on a kind of a peace time mindset for the last several decades, and I believe, as a country, we need to ramp up to more of a wartime footing. And like I said, I think money and focus needs to go to the sub-tier suppliers that feed into not only us, but other industry partners, generally through primes and then to the end users. So maybe a longer answer than you wanted, Kristine, but I tried to hit a lot of different topics as it surrounds Aerojet Rocketdyne. So I think I'll just end on that. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I actually wanted to switch subjects and ask about Tactical RF. Maybe, if you could talk about book-to-bill in the quarter where backlog stands and give us some pipeline color, both domestically and internationally? And also if you can answer the supply chain questions, how that's evolved in that business line? Thanks. Michelle Turner : Yes. So thanks for the question. From an overall comps perspective, we continue to be on track to deliver to our guidance, which was double-digit growth across the business, which includes to your point, gotten about the [bidding] [ph] supply chain challenges. which we continue to see along with the acquisition of our tactical data links business. Specific to radios and comms from an overall DoD budgetary perspective, we continue to see support. We're about 40% of the way through that modernization program. And we continue to see strong demand internationally as well. And so overall, I'd say we're feeling like we're in a good place from a comps perspective. And then just from looking at supply chain specifically, we continue to see hiccups like you're hearing across the industry, but significant complements to our supply chain, our tactical communication business, Sam Mehta, Chris Abley. The efforts that they've put in over the last 18 to 24 months in truly building a resilient supply chain that allows us to pivot when we continue to experience these hiccups is enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. And the other thing I would note for this quarter is that our overall deliveries are actually up from Q2. And so we continue to see the results of the efforts and the diligence that the team has put in over the last 18 to 24 months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Chris, so you've alluded to the competing inputs for national security spending. I guess when you think about what's evolving geopolitically versus what's evolving with the deficit battle in the U.S., maybe some of the short-term items as well. I guess, what do you -- how are you thinking about what your medium-term end market growth rate is? And your latest thinking on the L3Harris spread versus that growth rate? Chris Kubasik : Yes. No, thanks. Noah, I appreciate the question. As I step back a moment, I think kind of implied in there is the budget and what's going to happen with the supplemental. So as we all know, we finally have the speaker of the house, so that's step 1. I do believe and I've been pretty outspoken on this. It feels like it's an even more dangerous world than it ever has been. You look at what's going on in the Mid East, Ukraine, South China seas, national security has to be a top priority. And I'm concerned that a government shutdown would clearly weaken our national security as does a continuing resolution. So I think I speak for the entire industry and probably our customers, we hope that we get a budget here in the next couple of weeks, so we can start having the money flow to the industrial base. There's been a lot of talk about the supplemental over $100 million, split between state and DoD and Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan and the south border. I think we feel confident there will be a supplemental, I don't know if it will be 1 or 2 or somehow be partitioned, but I look at the supplemental as kind of playing into the near term. And I think when I look at our portfolio of products, literally products, not necessarily systems or platforms, we've been well positioned, specifically in Ukraine with a quick turn on the radios, night vision goggle, sites, sensors, cameras. So I look at the supplemental to kind of help us in the near-term. The midterm, I think, is relying more on a continued budget growth, the need to invest in technologies, advanced technologies for a peer or near-peer threats. And we keep talking about that as part of our national defense strategy, but we keep getting distracted by these other conflicts. So I think that's probably where I feel good about how we've shaped our portfolio specifically in the space arena, a lot of the missions that were normally conducted in the air domain, not all of them, but some of them have been moving to space. And I know people get tired of me saying it. I think this is the best example of our trusted disruptor strategy working. And at the date of the merger, L3Harris had zero satellites in orbit as a Prime. And as I look at our manifest in our backlog, we could very likely have 50, 5-0, 50, L3Harris Prime satellites and orbit in the next 3 to 5 years. So I think we're well positioned there. They tend to be more LEO satellites, 3-to-4-year useful lives, large constellations. So you can kind of see that as a potential ongoing annuity. In fact, we're building state-of-the-art factory for the satellite integration. So clearly, I see upside there. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we talked about the munitions. We are in the rocket motor, solid rocket motor business supporting some great primes who ultimately integrate the missile. So I feel comfortable with our position there. Michelle talked about the radios. We made an acquisition earlier this year on tactical battle links from ViaSat. And we keep talking about the connectivity of this network, and it is happening, and it is going to happen. It's hard to find the budgetary numbers, but these different domains, space, air, land, sea, they have to be able to connect across services, multi-domain, all those buzzwords we hear, but it's critical and it's happening, and someone has asked me best to try to explain with waveforms and all these different things that we're doing with Link 16. And I think the simplest way I could come up with is just categorizing it as Stealth communications. I think that's kind of a simple way to look at it. And we have the footprint on these 20,000 platforms. So we're upgrading, if you will, an existing network of connectivity and I'll just say, making it stealth. So I think depending on the budget world events, you got to feel like mid-single-digit growth is not an unreasonable aspiration over the midterm. And that's what we're striving for. And as I mentioned to Kristine, I still think as a nation, we have to find a way to invest in the infrastructure to build the capacity of this industrial base given the surge of certain key products and areas. So that's how I see it, Noah. Operator : Next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Scott Deuschle : I have two quick questions, both for Michelle. The first is on what's driving the difference between the $56 million of M&A expense add-backs on the P&L and the $215 million of add-backs for M&A on adjusted free cash flow. So that's my first question. And then my second question is what would drive CS margins to the 26% range in the fourth quarter, which is I think what's implied in the guide. Thanks. Michelle Turner : Thanks for that Scott. I'm going to start with the margin question and kind of take a step back and address it starting with the enterprise margins because we really think about this as managing our portfolio. So we're encouraged with the overall margin results within the quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of sequential improving margins at 15% and this includes 2 months of Aerojet as part of our portfolio. And so, we're most pleased because we're starting to see the efforts of our actions related to our Performance First initiative, which you may remember is really grounded in meeting the commitments of our customers and shareholders, and it's starting to pay dividends now in terms of margin improvement. So I'll walk through each of the segments because I think there's a lot of good work that's happening across the organization, plus it gives you a little bit of flavor as to how you should think about your models go forward. So I'll start with our Space and Airborne Systems business. It delivered a record op profit in Q3 and 12.5% margins. And [indiscernible] and the SAS team have really been early adopters on our LHX NeXt initiative in terms of really leaning into maniacally managing cost and spend, but also looking at organizational construct to ensure that we are most effectively running our business. The SAS business also benefited from a couple of accretive contract mods that they were successful and being able to deliver on within the quarter. And so when you look at Q4, there is a step-down as a result of those onetime accretive actions that occurred within Q3. From an Integrated Mission Systems business perspective, this business and along with John Rambo's leadership and the IMS leadership team, saw sequential margin improvement of 180 basis points from Q2. And so you may remember this is where we've had the most acute EAC programmatic challenges in the first half of the year. And a lot of the work that John and his team are doing are starting to pay dividends now where we sit here in Q3. Now this will continue to be a bit of a lumpy part of our portfolio. But we expect that the worst is behind us in terms of overall programmatic challenges within IMS. Within our CS business, I'm getting specifically to your question, Scott, CS delivered consistent with our expectations within the quarter, along with consistent with Q1. And so we anticipated Q3 to be lower margins aligned with a heavier DoD shipment mix from a tactical radio perspective. And as I noted earlier, we actually delivered more radios this quarter. So this really speaks to the efforts that we're really putting around driving a resilient supply chain. A lot of work has gone into this from the teams to make this happen. And then, finally, from an Aerojet perspective, 2 months, a little over 90 days as part of our portfolio, roughly 12% margins within the quarter. You will note though there is a step-down within Q4. Q3 did benefit from about $8 million of purchase price accounting adjustments within the quarter. So we expect in the year consistent with the guide that we have updated for. And then, Scott, to your question about the difference between the expense and the cash impact. This is really driven by the Aerojet acquisition cash that flowed out closure from what was originally booked on the books of Aerojet from an expense perspective, we actually paid that cash post-closing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Jason Gursky : I just wanted to go back to the Space business for a minute, if you don't mind. Little contracting things going on here in the industry this quarter, you guys had a positive EAC in one of your customers, one of your competitors out there in the world at a very large start this quarter in the aerospace business. So I wonder if you could just help us or maybe walk around the space portfolio and tell us a little bit about what you have in that portfolio from a fixed price versus cost plus kind of mix and help us understand what the risks are and what the opportunities are as it relates to both revenue in the future. But I think most importantly, given what we're seeing across the industry, kind of what the risks might be on execution in EACs and just kind of help us better understand the overall health of that business. Chris Kubasik : Okay. Well, let me take that one, Jason. Great question. And yes, I mean to give the answer on the cost plus fixed price, it's about 50-50 between the 2. And that's a big change over the last decade or so. I mean, people generally would have thought of space being predominantly cost plus if you go back 10 or 20 years. And as you know, that trend has changed, bringing more risk to everyone. I think a lot of this goes back, I don't know specifically who you're referring to. But I think a lot of the challenges that the industry is having stems from the supply chain, which I'm sure is getting hold hearing that. But if you go back a few years, we were talking about our portfolio, having a combination of short-cycle, quick-turn products that were reliant on microelectronic parts. So I felt like L3Harris was kind of at the pointy end of the spear and leading the industry and the supply chain adverse impacts given the fact we couldn't get those parts to deliver our core products and recognize the revenue and profit. And then I think the longer cycle business is, which I would kind of throw space in there. It's also having supply chain issues. But the challenge there, I believe, is more on inflation and then workmanship that everybody is dealing with those quality challenges. So while there's still supply chain challenges, I think they've shifted. And I think they're hitting the longer-cycle businesses now. So what we've done is really double down on our bidding discipline, some of the longer-cycle things going back 5 years, probably are making less margin than I would like. But on the new bids, we're clearly factoring in the appropriate risks, taking the most current estimates, and we're not going to bid to lose money and do the best we can whether it's terms and conditions, contract reopenings, escalation clauses to protect ourselves. So I feel like we're doing a pretty good job on the bidding discipline. We have regular independent reviews of our key programs, and that helps, again, identify risk early to the extent we have any and then work on mitigation or workaround. So you see how we're doing relative to the others on margins in space, and we're pretty solid compared to our peers, and we haven't had, fortunately, any major write-offs. We continue to not bid fixed-price development programs that simultaneously ask for development and production, as I've said before. It's hard enough to estimate the development let alone commit to production for 1, 2 or 3 lots in '26, '27 and 2028. So we will continue to now bid those. And ultimately, the customer has to use the right vehicle -- contracting vehicle, I believe. And I think at some point in time, everyone in the industry will stop bidding and we'll get the right vehicle, and we'll fight it out for the best solution. We are more than happy to sacrifice top-line growth for profitability, cash and margin. And I've said before, the best way to get your margins up is stop writing off money on programs, and that moves the needle, and that's what we're trying to do. I think it's some real tangible evidence. We had some fixed price contracts for missile tracking, we have one for the Missile Defense Agency. We refer to as HBTSS, and we have 4 for the SDA, call it Space Force Now, Tranche 0 for tracking. And those satellites are done and waiting to be launched. So I can't wait to get those things in orbit. And I think that's pretty good evidence that we're able to meet our commitments relative to cost and schedule notwithstanding all the challenges from the supply chain inflation, attrition and such. So we feel pretty good about our Aerospace business, and we've been able to attract new talent, which helps as well. So hopefully, that answers your question there, Jason. Michelle Turner : I would just add to complement that along with the SDA and NDA work that Chris just referred to. We also have a very steady, stable business that we've been in for decades from a civil weather perspective. And so that -- there's also a growth cycle that's happening there, and we booked about $1.5 billion associated with that business. So it's a good complement to the other work that's really growing from a DoD perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global Research. Richard Safran : Chris, I heard your remarks about 2024 in the Investor Day, but I thought you might be willing to discuss and maybe give a qualitative assessment of which segments have the most room to grow in '24? Any color you could provide there, I thought would be helpful. Chris Kubasik : Are you going to come visit us in December at our Investor Day, Rich? Richard Safran : I'm already signed up. Chris Kubasik : Well, there you go, there you go. I mean this is like the coming attraction here. This is after Taylor Swift, it's the second hottest ticket in Florida apparently. So we're in the process of going through our 2024 plan, actually next month. So I'm not going to actually give you an answer that will be satisfying. I will tell you, based on what I see right now, it looks like all 4 of our segments will be growing. So we'll reveal which ones are growing faster in December. But in all seriousness, we kind of want to get through the next month or two and see what's going to happen. We can't have a government shutdown for any period of time. We can't have a continuing resolution. We all know the impact that has on our business. We all say it really doesn't impact 2023 because the year is 3 quarters over. It's more or less true, but 2024, a 1-year CR, which I'm not at all suggesting will happen. But the one thing we can all agree on is we have no idea what's going to happen in D.C. And I kind of want to get through November and get some of those things behind us, including world events. But right now, it looks like we're going to experience top line growth in all segments. And on a consolidated basis, which we'll be talking about in December. I expect cash and OI and EPS notwithstanding pension headwinds and revenue to all grow. So that's encouraging, but details to come. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Ken Herbert : Chris, maybe just following up for Michelle on that comment and some of the comments on AJRD in the opening remarks, beyond some of the Defense Production Act opportunities, can you just talk about how you're viewing CapEx across sort of legacy L3Harris and then more importantly, sort of AJRD as we think about 2024 and half of this year. And are you seeing a need to specifically sort of accelerate CapEx in AJRD to address some of the issues you outlined? And maybe how should we think about that as it relates to the growth in free cash next year? Chris Kubasik : Yes. I'll start it off and then ask Michelle to fill in. I mean we're going to continue to prioritize our R&D and our CapEx based on business cases and based on needs. I think Aerojet Rocketdyne always had $50 million, $60 million of CapEx in their plan so that I don't see any scenario where that would change or come down significantly. But we'll look at it compared to all the other investments that we have. I think I've all been said, it's a pretty high-growth market. and we're trying to accelerate. So between the DPA money, which is over 200, the $50 million to $60 million annual CapEx, any other supplemental sources of funding we get sometimes from states and local municipalities. I think it all fits within our overall CapEx target and to the extent we need more, it will be at the expense of something else in the legacy portfolio that we don't view is having the near-term need or the ROI. So that's kind of how I see it. There could be new markets down the road once we kind of catch up on this acceleration. And those will be case by case, but there's a lot of exciting new technologies within Aerojet Rocketdyne, but the team is really focused on the backlog and the core business for now. Michelle Turner : Yes. So I would just add in terms of your question, Ken, around free cash flow for next year. So to Chris' comments, we do expect income to grow. So we think that, that will be a tailwind from an overall cash perspective. We expect some kind of nominal improvement in working capital. And then offsetting that, just as a reminder for everybody, our initial deal model on Aerojet assumed free cash flow accretion in year 2. So we expect there'll be some kind of marginal impact just in totality of where they're at in the program cycle. And then, on overall CapEx, we typically run around 2%. We're not expecting any fundamental change in that level of investment as we go into next year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matt Akers : I wanted to ask if you could touch on LHX NeXt a little bit. And specifically, just curious of the $500 million benefit that you called out, how much do you get to keep? Does any of that flow back to your customer or any other offsets we should think about? Michelle Turner : Yes. Thanks for this question. I'm glad we're getting to talk about it a little bit more. And so this is the next phase of our L3 and Harris merger evolution, if you will. And so if you think about the initial integration savings that we did as a company, several hundred million along with some offsets. This is the next phase of this, kind of the harder parts, if you will. And it's really focused on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies and also functional organization to ensure that we're optimized for value creation. And so to your point specifically around the overall bottom-line impact, we do anticipate that there's more investment that goes along with this phase of the journey, Matt. So you'll see in our investor letter, we laid out about $400 million of investment. And so you should think of this more as a nominal tailwind from a margin perspective and not flow it all to the bottom-line. But I do want to highlight a couple of tangible examples that the teams have already driven as we're in the early stages of this, just so you can start to characterize what are we talking about, when we're talking high level about LHX NeXt. And one of our recent wins, I'll complement our HR team in [indiscernible]. They've done a fantastic job in renegotiating our employee benefit package, again, leveraging the scale of the new L3Harris portfolio to not only increase our benefits and also save on costs, but we're also going to be holding our employee benefit cost flat to our employees. So this is really creating a win-win opportunity, both from a shareholder perspective, and our employees in terms of better benefits while maintaining the cost that they have to flow back to their families. And then, on the organizational side of the equation, our comms team led by Tania Hanna has redesigned how we serve the company from a comms perspective and really focusing on the things that matter, right? And so, when you think about comms and how we send out external communications or internal communications, what are the things that are really going to move the needle from a value creation perspective in terms of our shareholders. And so they focused on streamlining our overall workflows, and we've actually reduced double digits the number of communications that we're distributing as a result. So that gives you a little bit of color as to the things we're looking at. But the biggest buckets, I would highlight here are really around the material opportunities, both on the direct side and the indirect side of the equation. And so again, going back to -- we're in our fifth year as a company and truly leveraging the scale of L3Harris as a $35 billion market cap. And what we can bring to the table and negotiating with our suppliers has a real opportunity to drive value for our shareholders. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Michelle, maybe another question for you. If you could talk about the path to the delevering and just kind of how much cash you need to have on the balance sheet. I think there's probably some more debt coming up, then the company will have an ability to repay. So how do you think about what to term out versus what to repay now? Michelle Turner : Yes. Thanks for this question as we want every opportunity, we can to highlight that we are focused on debt repayment. And so what are we going to focus on first? We're going to focus on the commercial paper, the higher interest rates the variable rates, if you will. Where we sit today, post-acquisition, we're at $13.5 billion, and our target by the end of the year is to get to about $13 billion of debt. And so from a leverage ratio perspective, we're looking to be at 3.5 and our expectation is that we get below 3 over the next couple of years. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Chris Kubasik : Rob, this will be our last question this morning. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Just stepping back, big picture, your margins are 15% today. How do we think about expansion from here, is it possible? And then, to that extent maybe specifically on communication systems, can you talk about the puts and takes there? Can you shake off some of these supply chain issues? And how do you think about the improvement progress and just the core margin of that business and run away from here? Chris Kubasik : Okay. I think I'll take this one since it's our last question, Sheila, and I guess you snuck in right under the wire here. So good morning. Yes, thanks for acknowledging the 15%, which I think are industry-leading margins, which we are quite, quite proud of. And even though they are industry leading, we are committed to find ways to continue to grow those margins. So on the CS side, we do have the commercial business model, which has played well for us. And that goes beyond just the tactical radios, we also have it at West Cam with our turrets and some of our sensors. So I think that's just an area that we need to leverage. We've been increasing our prices to cover the dilutive effect of the cost increase. And I think that's something that this industry doesn't naturally do. I think we all see in our day-to-day lives, prices are going up all over the place. So we tend to try to want to hold pricing flat. But the new reality is, it's cost you more to buy components and labor. And Michelle mentioned, holding the employee benefit costs flat for 2 years in a row. Those are going to be priced into our products, plain and simple, and that's going to help keep the profitability where it is, if not maybe even increase it. And again, we'll try to leverage the supply chain and power the enterprise. We recently had some successful negotiations by working across all the segments and sectors, getting all the buy together and negotiating at a corporate-wide basis for actually direct material, and everybody does that for indirect, but direct is a lot harder, and we were able to pull that off. So I think that's a key part of it. We haven't talked about E3. That is just in the DNA. It's something we do every day, and that will continue to offset some of the headwinds and contribute to our bottom-line. LHX NeXt, as Michelle gave a great description is, I think, is really a key differentiator for us. It's the continuation, like you said, of what we started with the merger. I think we did the easy stuff first and this is the harder piece and the ultimate goal is to simplify the business and change the way we do business. Everyone wants to just take an arbitrary cut to lower their G&A or overhead, but we are looking at everything and seeing if we can eliminate it, do it differently. And she gave some good early examples, but I think there's a heck of a lot more we can do and that will contribute to lowering our cost base, which will make us more competitive and/or contribute to the bottom-line. And I said it earlier, and I think it's the truth. If you just look at the programs, which you don't have all the visibility to, I appreciate. But if you don't debook profit and you don't have losses, the margins will just naturally grow. So that comes back to the discipline, and I will trade off revenue growth every day of the week for profitable programs. And it's easy to say and sometimes it's harder to do, but if we can get to the point where we're not writing off money on programs for whatever reason, there's only overhead material and labor sounds simple, but you have to get the right contracting vehicle, the right contracting terms, push back on the customer and negotiate a fair deal for all, and that's something we are absolutely going to do. Relative to the mix, I think what you're getting out there is, we do have a portfolio, and we're always going to have cost-plus jobs and fixed price and the cost-plus jobs, generally our development and on the front-end of a potential long-term franchise or annuity of programs. So we will bid, and we will win cost-plus programs. And we all know those margins are dilutive. But I look at it on an ROIC basis, it's effectively infinite. So if we can get 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% cost-plus jobs that lead to low-rate production that lead to full rate production that lead to exporting. That is the grand slam of new business. We will bid it each and every time. And as a portfolio, as Michelle said, we run the company as a portfolio, we look at our financial results as a portfolio. Some segments have a good quarter, some don't. We put it all together, I could not be more proud of the team and what we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations on revenue, EPS and cash and it's something we're quite proud of. Chris Kubasik : So I think with that, I'll just thank everybody for joining the call this morning and another shout out to the employees who are really coming through and delivering a great third quarter. I know we're all working hard on Q4 and can't wait to see everybody in early December for our Investor Day down here in Florida. So with that, we will sign off, and thank you again. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the opening remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Mark Kratz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. We've updated our quarterly earnings approach based on feedback and yesterday evening, we published our fourth quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We've also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. As a reminder, today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. Specifically, I will note, segment operating income, which excludes items such as impairments to goodwill and other assets reported at the business segment level. I would now like to turn it over to Chris and Ken for some opening remarks. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Thanks, Mark, and welcome, Ken, to your first L3Harris earnings call. We're excited to have you on the team. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Chris. I'm excited to be a part of the team. Christopher Kubasik : All right. I want to start by thanking our investors and analysts for attending our Investor Day last month. We had a great turnout and appreciate the strong positive feedback from the event. 2023 marked the fourth full year since the merger and served as an inflection point in many respects. We met our financial commitments. We closed our integrating and seeing the benefits of two acquisitions that are focused on national security and aligned with defense spending priorities. We announced the sale of a non-core business further aligning our portfolio and we returned to growth following a few years of macroeconomic disruptions. This past year, we also strengthened our leadership team and Board of Directors adding key talent that will help drive future value for our investors, customers and employees. This year's progress gives us confidence that we have set the foundation to achieve the financial outlook that we laid out at our Investor Day and are reaffirming today with segment level detail. Globally, the threat environment remains elevated emphasizing the importance of our mission. With the national security-focused portfolio, we continue to support the US and its allies providing vital solutions for our customers' most critical missions. Domestically, we await Congress to pass all 12 appropriation bills by the end of April including the pending vote for an $842 billion topline defense budget which has solid support for our programs, most notably, in the areas of space, missiles, intelligence, and resilient communications. In 2023, demand remained strong. We reported a record $23 billion in orders, including key awards for the US Army's Manpack and Leader Radios, Compass Call missionized business jets, and rocket motors for the Army's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. The orders we received in 2023 contributed to a record backlog of $33 billion, more than doubled to $16 billion of backlog at the time of the merger. This positive momentum continued into early 2024, underscored by the recent award for 18 satellites from the Space Development Agency for more than $900 million. Internationally, orders were up 24% including tactical radios, VAMPIRE systems for Ukraine, and an international space award that leverages our 55-year trusted heritage to build and deliver advanced payloads for Japan's next-generation weather satellite. We are maintaining our international growth strategy and aim to improve that mix over the medium term. Operationally, our Performance First culture has been a driving factor in meeting our financial commitments, and we are gaining momentum as we focus on profitable growth. We're about six months into the Aerojet Rocketdyne integration and we have captured the $50 million in cost synergies that we were targeting. The team is using the savings to deploy resources from across L3Harris to help improve operational performance and ultimately increase capacity. In our short time owning this business, we are seeing improvements and we are progressing towards returning to contracted production levels. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we are executing on our LHX NeXt initiative aimed at delivering $1 billion in gross cost savings over the next three years. These efficiencies will optimize our infrastructure and leverage our scale, which enables us to achieve margin expansion moving forward. We executed a number of projects included in exiting facility leases to reduce cost and overall square footage. We continue with our ERP consolidation with 10 reporting units being consolidated into one reporting unit earlier this month. And at the program level, our continued focus on program excellence has helped drive better EAC performance. However, we have more work to do in this area. In 2024, we are prioritizing our focus on execution, margin expansions, and growing free cash flow. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate parts of our portfolio against strategic alternatives for non-core assets. It should be clear that we have made significant progress on the journey to transform the company. Our core businesses are aligned with our customers' priorities and provide many levers to enable us to create shareholder value. Ken will discuss our capital deployment strategy in more detail, but it is unchanged from what we discussed at Investor Day. We will invest to grow organically to delever the balance sheet and then to return excess cash to shareholders. Our strategy is backed by our diverse and talented team and we continue to invest in our workforce, both financially and professionally. This gives me confidence that we have the right leaders in place to execute our imperatives and drive long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Ken for some financial details including our 2024 guidance. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks and good morning, everyone. It's great to be part of the L3Harris team and working alongside Chris. Over the last six weeks, I've been actively engaged with the team, reviewing the business and our financial plan. I'm all in on our approach and grow more confident with each day. We'll be on the road meeting with investors next week and attending a few conferences during the quarter, so I look forward to re-engaging with you all over the coming months. Let's start with consolidated results, which were all in line with our latest guidance. We reported full-year revenue of $19.4 billion at the high end of our guidance, up 14% year-over-year and 6% organically, which was primarily from growth in our Space and Airborne Systems and Communication Systems segments. We delivered segment operating margin of 14.8%, earnings of $12.36 a share and free cash flow was just over $2 billion. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.3 billion, up 17%, largely driven by the Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links acquisitions and continued strong growth in space systems and resilient communications. Fourth quarter segment margin was 15.1%, up 50 basis points from higher volume and favorable product mix, and better program performance, which all resulted in net positive EAC adjustments. The first net positive quarter since mid-2022. Fourth quarter earnings per share grew 2% to $3.35. Let me hit on segment results before turning to 2024 guidance. SAS reported revenue of $6.8 billion for the year, up 7% as we continue to see strong growth in Space, Mission Networks, and Intel & Cyber programs. I've been impressed with what we're doing in Space. To me, this demonstrates how we are thinking differently, responding quickly, making targeted investments, and seeing them pay off and growing in enduring markets. It's exciting to see how much progress we have made in responsive space where we are taking share. Segment operating margin was 11.4% for the year, down 30 basis points, driven by growth in those early phase Space programs. We are now beginning to move into the more mature production phase of these programs as we look to improve margin in 2024. In IMS, revenue was $6.6 billion for the year, which was roughly flat. Segment operating margin was 11.2%, down 180 basis points from program challenges and lower international mix. I've looked at the changes the team has implemented throughout the year to address these operational challenges and believe that the multipronged approach, including leadership changes, training, and maturing programmatic risk management processes will improve the business going forward. We've already seen sequential improvements within the business and expect greater financial stability in 2024. CS revenue was $5.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year, with 12% organic growth. Beyond the acquisition of TDL, revenue growth was driven by higher volume of Tactical Communication equipment. Segment operating margin was 24.2%, flat year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by lower international mix. I will note that CS had a great Q4 with record operating margin since the merger at 26.1%. Lastly, Aerojet Rocketdyne revenue was over $1 billion and operating margin was 11.6% for the post-acquisition period. The new leadership team Aerojet Rocketdyne is working to drive operational improvements to increase throughput of its critical products. Expanding on Chris' comments, early actions the team has taken include investing in critical suppliers, deploying resources to their sites, improving processes, and co-investing in supplier infrastructure. We look forward to sharing more data with you as we progress on these efforts in 2024. Turning now to 2024 guidance, which is consistent with the framework that we presented at Investor Day. We expect $20.7 billion to $21.3 billion in revenue with organic growth in all segments. As you fill out your models, I would note that with strong fourth quarter results at CS and some favorable SAS timing, we expect a slower top line growth rate to start the year. IMS and total company guidance also contemplates the sale of CAS in 2024 with any potential timing impact within the revenue and margin guidance ranges. Consolidated segment operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 15% from efficiencies gained with increased volume, operational improvements and LHX NeXt cost savings. This is partially offset by a full year of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Throughout the year, margins should gain momentum driven by program ramps, international product mix and accelerating LHX NeXt cost savings. We do have two nonoperational headwinds totaling more than $200 million. First is lower pension income, which we anticipate netting to about $300 million this year and second is an anticipated $650 million in interest expense. With taxes and share count, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS to grow to a range of $12.40 to $12.80. We should see it grow ratably across the quarters, ultimately reflecting a sequential build much like we saw in 2023. We closed out 2023 with solid working capital improvement coming down from elevated levels during the pandemic. The team and I are keenly focused on this as we aim to grow free cash flow over the next several years. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, up 10%, driven by earnings growth and continued balance sheet efficiency. At a segment level, we expect SAS revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with operating margin in the mid to high 11% range. IMS revenue is anticipated to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid-11% range, driven by lower-than-historical international mix. We expect CS revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid 24% range. And for Aerojet Rocketdyne, we anticipate revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion and operating margin in the high 11% range. As Chris mentioned, our capital allocation priority remains focused on first, paying down debt to achieve a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 and then a shift to returning all excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the dividend, we continue to target a payout ratio of 35% to 40% of free cash flow. For share repurchases, I will note that we returned over $0.5 billion in 2023, we are targeting a similar amount in 2024, and we look to accelerate buyback in '25 and 2026. To close out, one of the reasons I joined L3Harris was my belief that there is tremendous value potential. In my time here, I have gained more confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 and future commitments. With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob? Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Hey, good morning, Scott. Scott Deuschle : Chris, can you give us an update on attrition and program performance at IMS? And then for Ken, the IMS margin guide implies '24 segment margins. I think will be down relative to the second half of '23. So like to hear a bit more on the thinking there. And then also for Ken, just maybe you can comment on your philosophy on guidance. And where you sit on the spectrum in terms of viewing guidance as an aspiration and operational plan or closer to a promise? Thank you. Christopher Kubasik : All right. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, talking about IMS, if we look at 2023, you'll see that we did improve margins in the second half compared to the first half. And as we've talked about, it is a little bit of a lumpy business based on the timing of aircraft purchases. We laid out at Investor Day that our strategy in the near term here was really to continue to have stability, especially with the program performance and focus on margin improvement. So to answer your question specifically, here in the short-term, we are seeing better program performance and I think that's what gives us confidence and opportunities not only for 2024 but the next several years. The attrition is definitely slowing down. We've been successful in hiring new people, training new employees, and I think that's starting to be reflected in our performance. And equally as important, the suppliers, and maybe more specifically in this case our subcontractors' performance is starting to improve as we got through those macroeconomic disruptions. The bidding rigor is improving, we've lowered the delegations of authority, so more bids are being reviewed. Not only at the segment level but the corporate level and we have at least one instance in the fourth quarter where we no bid a fixed price development program, and I've been talking about this for at least a year and we will continue to no bid programs where the contract type does not appropriate for the risks we're assuming and I said it in December and I'll say it again. I will sacrifice revenue for earnings and cash every day of the year and we will continue to do so until that changes. And of course, we're making structural changes to the business. In the midterm, I see upside to the margins as we're going to grow internationally at IMS. We're looking at about 25% international this year. I see that getting into the 30% range in a couple of years, driven by WESCAM and international business jets. In fact, this quarter already European customer has awarded $300 million award to us for aircraft missionization and that will be accretive to our margins. And then when we, sure, we will talk more about LHX NeXt in the time that remains but I think this segment is clearly ripe for opportunities. We laid out the fact despite all the good work we've done in the last four years, we still have 100 facilities. We still have eight different ERP vendors and we have 24 reporting units. I did mention that 10 of those in my comments were migrated into one. So we're making progress and the team has taken action, takes some investment on our part, but I like the momentum in the path that we're on. So maybe with that, Ken, you want to? Kenneth Bedingfield : Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott, and I think Chris hit it well. I'll just add a couple of points. One, the guidance for IMS does assume the CAS divestiture during 2024. CAS does have higher average margins than IMS as a segment. So that's a little bit of a headwind at a margin level for IMS. In terms of timing, we did have some large aircraft procurements in the first half of '23. Nothing in the second half of 2023. So that helped the margin pick up a little bit in the second half of '24, as well as solid program performance. We do see again it's stabilizing as we look forward and we look forward to the team delivering on that. And then thirdly, I guess what I would say is the EO product line tends to build throughout the year that, Scott, solid commercial-like margins. And so we'll see that more likely contributing in the second half as well. With respect to the second part of your question on guidance philosophy, I'll just say, look, again, I'm excited to be a part of the team. We've spent a lot of time thinking about kind of where we are and what this business can do. I think we've laid out a guidance that is something that we can meet and work to build to deliver confidence on during the year. And this is something we're putting out there and that's something that we intend to deliver on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Douglas Harned : Good morning and thank you. Christopher Kubasik : Hi. Good morning, Doug. Douglas Harned : At the investor conference, you talked about looking to 2026 and basically there was a 100 basis point upside guide to each of the segments. But when you look across them, the opportunity there, it can't be uniform. So perhaps you can help us think through when you look at each of the segments where there is opportunity for more? And maybe in some cases, it might be more difficult to get to that number. Christopher Kubasik : Yeah, Doug. Let me take that one. Yeah, let me start with where we are on margins. I mean, we have well-documented that our margins have declined in the last couple of years. We acknowledge we have had some performance issues across the portfolio. But I also want to mention that we have consciously made investments in some high-growth programs and businesses, which impacted the margins in the short-term, but we believe create value in the long-term, and I think Space is probably the best example that we keep highlighting in that regard. Investor Day we did step up our cost savings goal to $1 billion gross run-rate savings by the end of '26 that goes across the entire enterprise. We're calling that program LHX NeXt, as you well know. And look, I agree with you that there's differences by segments for a variety of reasons, and we're setting out a framework, three years out. So we put the 100 -- the 100 basis points is kind of the floor. If I go through or maybe in the -- in some form of order relative to the ability to realize the 100 basis points either earlier or exceeded, I'd like to start with Communication Systems. I think we all know that that has a commercial business model and the potential for more international growth. I think those will be key drivers. We run that like a commercial factory where we make the radios. We look at the quality, the cost of poor quality, the real throughput yield. We're making investments in equipment and training that gives us potential upside. And in that regard, pretty much every dollar falls to the bottom line. We're also looking at the models and seeing if we can be more aggressive on increasing our software sales as an example in addition to the hardware. So, CS would probably be at the top of my list. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we've only had it for five months. We're starting to see some improvements. Big, big volume increase, big investment in capacity, and negotiating the new contracts. Maybe I'll just mention now since owning them, we've already turned in 200 proposals for over $13 billion. Of course, we have to win them and negotiate them, but clearly, the demand is outweighing the supply. So feel good about the potential there, and the ability to return to their historical margins or even better. Scott asked about IMS. I think I laid that out. I think there's upside there with the shift to international. Again, we have the WESCAM business that provides designs and builds and delivers turrets or cameras or gimbals, whatever you want to call them. Again, that's a commercial business model which has accretive margins to the business and end of the day, it comes down to stabilizing the volatility and the program performance, and I think with some leadership changes and better negotiations on new contracts, we should be in a better shape there. And then, of course, Space or SAS, it does have the highest mix of cost plus contracts, Doug, as you know. So most of those savings go back to the customer. But again, the investments that we've made to get into some of these new markets, such as Space, will be decreasing or have decreased. So I don't know if that gives you a little more granularity. I think as we get closer to 2026, we'll be able to be more specific, but the 100 basis points is the floor, and that's kind of my order of how I'd put them. I don't know, Ken, if you agree or have different thoughts there. Kenneth Bedingfield : No, I think you hit it well. Christopher Kubasik : All right. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Ronald Epstein : Yeah. Good morning, guys. One of the big focuses at the Investor Day was the Space business. And maybe if you can give us a deeper dive into how that's going, work on the SDA transport and tracking layers, and maybe continued opportunities for growth in that business. Christopher Kubasik : Yeah. Space, we keep talking about Space and highlighting. That is kind of the model for our trusted disruptor strategy. So we've one -- we're really just on the tracking for SDA. So we won tranche zero, we won tranche one. And as I mentioned just a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded tranche two. So I think we've gone from four satellites to eight satellites to 18, so and there will be a tranche three and beyond, I would expect. I can tell you that in each of those successive contracts, the margins that we bid and expect have increased, which was part of our strategy. So the team is performing well. We have satellites waiting to be launched. So we're looking at these annuity-long cycle constellations, and we've talked about the missions really migrating from the air domain to the space domain, and I think we're seeing it here. And these satellites will have single-digit useful lives, and they'll need to be repopulated over time. So I kind of look at this as an annuity where in several years, the tranche zero satellites will deorbit and they'll need additional satellites to be launched. So three for three. Quite proud of the team, and I think our customer is obviously pleased with our performance. I did mention we do have a pretty good business in weather satellite, so it was exciting to see us get some international opportunities. You don't necessarily see that all the time in the Space business. So that's some additional growth. And we still provide payloads for exquisite satellites where we're a sub to the primes. Most of those are classified. So pretty good backlog. We also mentioned it at Investor Day. We're investing in building a satellite factory here in Florida and that ground has been broken and we're excited about that. So we'll be able to turn satellites at a pretty quick pace here in the near term. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning, David . David Strauss : So, Chris, I guess following up on Ron's question, SAS, I think in '23 you did something like 8% organic growth. It looks like your guidance for this year is only 2% organic growth. So if you could touch on the slowdown there that you're anticipating, I guess, broken out between Space and maybe the Avionics piece of the business. And then could you also touch on the forecast for Aerojet this year? It looks like if you just kind of annualize the run rate of sales, you're not really anticipating any growth at all out of Aerojet this year. Thanks. Christopher Kubasik : All right, David. No, good questions. Yeah, so if I look at SAS, we have several sectors there, two of them, relatively large are flat. The air domain that we've talked about is a flat business. It's a good business with good margins. This is where we perform on mission systems for F-35, F-16, F-18, some classified platforms, but a relatively flat market. And as I just mentioned, those missions are migrating into Space in some cases. So that's how we see that playing out. Mission Networks, which does a lot of work for the FAA, is a very solid business. Good margins, but that's traditionally a pretty flat business for the foreseeable future, especially given some of the budget pressures at the FAA. So that's two of our segments or two of our sectors. Space is growing and Intel and Cyber are growing as well. Just as an aside, I mentioned a lot of this -- more of this business is cost plus than most. So as we continue to reduce cost, I think, David, sometimes -- not sometimes, it always does ultimately reduce your revenue a little bit as well. So the good news of taking out costs, you get higher margins. And as continue to say revenue is interesting, but I'll take margins and cash and EBIT every day, and that's a little bit of the headwind. So that's how I see SAS coming out where it does. And second question on Aerojet Rocketdyne, interesting that you say that, because nobody really knows what their 2023 revenue is. We will disclose that in the 10-K, they only reported the first quarter. There were four months that weren't reported, and then we reported the five months. Anyway, when you see those numbers, you will see that we're right around 5% top-line growth, 2024, compared to the pro-former 2023. Aerojet disclosed three months, we disclosed five. The four fell through the cracks just based on how the accounting works. So we'll put that all in there, and you'll see the 5% growth. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Chris, just to stay on Aerojet, looks like, I think, you said you got all $50 million of cost synergies achieved. I mean, it sounds like that was a lot of low-hanging fruit, public company cost. Is there more there? I mean, is that layered into the next initiative? And then I guess just on NeXt, what flowed through in the quarter? I mean, we saw the $47 million in cost. What did you net out in savings? I think the goal was $175 million for the year. And does one segment maybe benefit disproportionately as you progress through NeXt? Christopher Kubasik : Yeah, I'll take the first part. Ask Ken to chime in on the second part. Yeah, the $50 million, we did go quickly to realize it. It obviously was a little more lower-hanging fruit than not, but it still takes a lot of time and effort, and we execute it, and we absolutely expect to get a little more out relative to what I'd call the integration. I mean, there's more work to do on the IT systems and tools. We have already aligned them on policies and procedures. All the personnel are already on our payroll systems, our benefit plans, and that type of stuff. So, yeah, we think there's probably an additional $20 million or $30 million that we can get that I would call integration. That will just roll into LHX NeXt. But Ken? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yeah. No, I agree on that front. I would say the team did a great job of working aggressively to get on top of the initial integration cost savings. We did hit that target. We're continuing to drive for more, but at this point, the primary focus is really around some of the operational efficiencies working to drive the throughput through the business and getting what were some bottlenecks to increased production out of the way so that we can deliver these critical capabilities to our customers at Aerojet. So, great work by the team, certainly continues. And as Chris mentioned, we'll continue to drive opportunity for further, not only integration, but I would say at this point, more importantly, operational efficiencies, again, to drive volume. In terms of LHX NeXt, what I would say is we are very consistent at this point with what we discussed at Investor Day, the gross run rate of a $1 billion savings. We talked about, to your question, $175 million of margin improvement exiting 2024. And I think we see that across the business. I don't necessarily see any individual sector that will benefit first from that. I think Chris talked about the margin opportunity at the sectors through 2026 in getting to our 16% margin framework, but in terms of LHX NeXt, a lot of confidence in the program, confidence in the team. We had set an initial target out there. As we started to work through it, we saw the ability to drive further savings out of that. I've got confidence that we're working to drive at least to that level of savings. And I think, again, all of the segments should see the benefit of that here in 2024. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Peter Arment : Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Chris and Ken. And welcome, Ken. Hey, Ken, maybe just on guidance, if there is, could you maybe level set us just on cadence if first half versus second half, anything to really call out? And then also it was highlighted at the Investor Day that working capital would certainly be positive contributor in cash over the kind of the guidance period. How are you thinking and seeing any opportunities from a working capital perspective, and maybe just working capital profile going forward? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : Sure. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate the question. Yeah, in terms of cadence, I would say as we look at the -- as we look at 2024, we think the revenue growth itself should be relatively steady throughout the year, probably a relatively even split 50-50 between the first half and the second half in terms of the growth from 2023, quarter-by-quarter, probably a little more of an accelerated ramp on the revenue side starting in the second quarter. In terms of EPS, I would say we'll kind of follow the margin trend. Talked about the margins would be a little bit slower in the first half of the year as we saw a strong performance in the fourth quarter, kind of across the board at the segments. And so we expect that to kind of build momentum as we work through the year. That margin momentum should fall through to EPS. And again, we'll probably see that kind of build sequentially, quarter-over-quarter through the year over 2023. And then from a free cash flow perspective, and on the working capital question, I would say the free cash flow profile will continue to be weighted towards the second half of the year. And on working capital, I think the team did a great job in driving down our working capital at the end of '23, but the work is never done. We'll continue to try to improve that in 2024, but we've got a lot of confidence in our growing free cash flow. We talked about 10% free cash flow growth that will be driven by certainly the margin growth, the margin improvement on growing revenues as well as continued and disciplined balance sheet management. Christopher Kubasik : And I'll just chime in, Peter, the continuing resolution. While we've had one every year since 2010, and I think we in the industry know how to deal with it, it does tend to slow things down, really, from a customer perspective. So as I mentioned, we are under a CR through March. Hopefully we'll get a defense budget and eleven other appropriation bills passed so we can get back to normal. But that causes a little bit of the slow start, unfortunately, like it does pretty much every year for the last 13. Peter Arment : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Christopher Kubasik : Hey, Seth. Seth Seifman : I wonder if you could talk in the Communications business where 2023 ended up on tactical radio sales and what you expect in 2024 for domestic and international and kind of the trajectory for each of those? Christopher Kubasik : Yeah, let me take that. We actually had a pretty -- we had a great year in CS and especially tactical radios specifically. The interesting thing here, as we talk about the margins, is really the mix between the DoD and the International. So when I looked at the first two quarters, we were heavily weighted towards International versus domestic and then it flipped again in Q3, Q4. And we'll start 2024 with a little more domestic deliveries than commercial, and then it flips in the back half. So we had a record year when it came to revenue in TCOM. I think the business is really coming together quite nicely. We've overcome most of the supply chain challenges. I know when we talked in the past, we literally had hundreds of key suppliers that we were tracking. Now we're down to just a handful. So the results are getting better. We're getting dual sources. And in fact, we've recently had some wins in some new markets that we've been informed of. We're not authorized to disclose them quite yet, but there's a lot of good news coming out of TCOM. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Robert Spingarn : Good morning, Chris. Welcome, Ken. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Rob. Robert Spingarn : So Chris, Ken touched on this, but maybe a quick operational update on Aerojet, but more in the context of some of these supply chain bottlenecks that are still there. Now obviously, this started well before your acquisition and part of the value proposition there is getting it back on pace, but a couple of things. Does it make any sense to bring any of the problem suppliers in-house? And then Lockheed's talking about standing up a third supplier, Anduril is building a business. So I wanted to see how you think about the longer-term market share implications if others come in. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Let me start -- cover a couple of things and work in specifically your question. The demand, I mentioned earlier, there's more demand than there is supply, which is a great thing when we look back on the acquisition. And to repeat myself, 200 proposals for $13 billion is something we would have never expected in just a six-month period. The infrastructure, great progress. We've got the $50 million. We've got the policies. We've got the personnel. The IT systems are in work. And in fact on the talent front, the attrition at Aerojet Rocketdyne has dropped by 1/3 overall and 50% for the engineers. We do these regular surveys. There's just a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about the acquisition, the strategy. And I think it's a tribute to the team that shows how we successfully have integrated them and welcomed them into L3Harris. Going back to the demand, it's all about capacity. We've talked about the DPA investment for $216 million focused on GMLRS and Javelin and Stinger. In fact, we've already acquired a building in Huntsville, Alabama. Our capacity and footprint there is 4x and that will ultimately -- it is, but it will ultimately be our inert center of excellence, which is great. The challenges are really at the sub-tier suppliers, as you said. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to bring them in-house. We've actually invested in some of these, not as an ownership, but by helping them with tooling and capital. Our customers have also -- our end customer and our immediate prime customers have also invested. So as we've said, there's a little bit of a chokepoint here at the sub-tier. Personally, I think over time, a third solid rocket motor provider is fine. We don't shy away from competition. But that doesn't really solve the problem because at the end of the day, everybody's going to be going to the same sub-tiers, for the cases, for the igniters, for the nozzles and such. So we have to fix the sub-tier. We're doing our part by helping them out financially, getting the equipment, improving their -- the capacity. And we started to see it. There is a big well documented, I think, we call it backlog or undelivered motors, and we're chipping away at that, as I mentioned. And once we get these facilities and equipment up and running, I think it's going to look pretty good. And, yes, there's a lot of people trying to get into this market now, which is fine. It's a high-growth market, and in my mind, reaffirms the rationale and the value potential from this acquisition. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Myles Walton : Ken, I'm hoping you can provide a few of the cash details on the surface, the Section 174 impact for '23 and '24, maybe what the benefit would be if they retroactively reversed it, what you've paid and what you could get back. And then maybe just also as it relates to stripping out from the cash numbers, is it just the $220 million for LHX NeXt that you laid out at Investor Day? Or are there other adjustments we should consider? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Myles. Let me -- I'll talk about 174 a little bit first and then get into the second part of the question. So let me just start by saying we've got a great tax team that works really hard every day to drive value for the business. And one of the things that I think they do well and we do well in supporting them is getting them really integrated with the businesses so that we get all the data, we get all the information needed to support our R&D deductions and credits. We work very closely with the IRS team to validate what we've got and what we're doing and how all that works. And I think we've done a great job. This is a business that invests heavily in R&D to drive future capability and future growth, and we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to see that benefit. In terms of the cash profile, what I'll say is that, in '23, we're able to catch up a little bit on some tax payments from a timing perspective. In terms of the new amortization of Section 174, we're able to kind of catch back up to being current through the end of '23 on the impact -- the cash impact of that. And then in terms of the new legislation that's working through, I'll say we're tracking that carefully, keeping an eye on it. The impact of that, if it is passed into law, would be positive for us from a cash perspective. And I don't want to put a number on it, but as currently drafted, would have some retroactive impact for, I believe, it's '22 and '23. So positive on cash. And then I think there would ultimately be a little bit of a rate headwind as we look forward. But I would say we'd be very willing to trade that little bit of rate benefit for the cash benefit that we see. And then in terms of kind of free cash flow guide for 2024 and the adjustments. At this point in time, what we're looking at in terms of what that would be adjusted for would largely be the LHX NeXt onetime implementation cost. To your question, I think that should be the largest item there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Chris and Ken. Christopher Kubasik : Hi, Sheila. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Chris, One for you, please. You mentioned international mix within IMS. More broadly, what are you seeing in the international pipeline? And how are you thinking about the timing of that conversion? And just thinking about the overall 3% organic growth guidance for '24, how does internal track relative to domestic, and what are the broader margin implications? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, the broader margin implication is we tend to have higher margins in international than domestic, just like we do with commercial. So I see an increase -- slight increase year-over-year. We're kind of hanging around the 22%, 23% of our revenue comes from international, maybe a little uptick in '24, '25 and '26. But every point helps. I think it comes down to this -- the one that's going to move the needle a little bit is going to be the supplementals. And we haven't talked a whole lot about DC in the budget. But there is a supplemental out there for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel put out last year for $110 billion. I think about $58 billion is targeted for the DoD. It's all tied up in politics as it relates to border security. But I think at the end of the day, we need to get these things passed because it's really just backfilling the stockpile that we've already given into several of the countries I mentioned. So hopefully, we get that behind us, and that will solidify our growth opportunities in those regions specifically. So as I look at each of the segments. Aerojet, as you know, most of that goes through a couple of primes. So we actually don't have any international revenue the way we disclose it for Aerojet, notwithstanding that several of these products get deployed from -- but from our perspective, we just sell them to two or three primes and then they put them wherever they need to go. So we just call that domestic for what that's worth. IMS, I talked about WESCAM and bizjets, I see upside there. SAS, it's really given the classified nature of so many things they do. We have an occasional space satellite, like I mentioned, in Japan. Some of the avionics stuff goes international as well. And then CS has the highest percentage of international mainly coming out of the tactical radio business. And when I look at what we've done in Ukraine and what's needed in Europe and the Mid-East and the Far East, it's looking rather positive. So I hope that help, Sheila. Mark Kratz : Rob, we're coming up on the hour, so maybe we'll take our last question this morning. Operator : Sure. Our last question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. Kenneth Bedingfield : Hey, Rob. Robert Stallard : And welcome back, Ken. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thank you. Robert Stallard : Chris, probably a question for you. Your counterpart at Lockheed Martin, Jim Taiclet was kind of talking about structural problems in the defense industry with regard to pricing and contracting and whether that could change in the future. I was wondering if you have any issues lingering in the L3Harris portfolio that maybe fits that criteria. But on the flip side, do you see the opportunity to grow more sort of commercial terms contracts in the future? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Good question, Robert. Look, we've all been in this industry for decades, and it kind of goes in cycles where everybody thought fixed-price development programs was a good idea in the '70s and '80s, and then it migrates back to cost-plus and goes the other way. Just kind of have to understand where the customer is and figure out where they're going. There's lots of opportunities to interface with them. We're we've been successful with our commercial business models that I've mentioned. I think there's more that we can look at in that regard. I think more and more things are moving towards software, and I think it's a new area. I think the DoD has to figure out how to buy software and we have to figure out how to sell software. There have been some cases where it's done. But again, that's probably a different business model than your traditional cost-plus, truth in negotiation type regulations may not make sense. And I think that's what a lot of the new entrants are also struggling with, to figure out how to get into those markets. So look, we all get to draft RFPs. We review them, we push back and sometimes you just have to no-bid. And one of these days, the entire industry is not going to bid on a fixed-price development contract and the DoD will change. But when you get one or two bids, they're going to make the award, and we're doing our best to balance the risk with the financial upside that we have, so probably a little more disciplined. But this has been an ongoing debate probably for decades, and we continue to engage with the customer, and I think they appreciate and understand where the industry is coming from. So we'll see what happens in the months and years ahead. Christopher Kubasik : So look, before I sign off, I really would like to take a moment and thank our 50,000 employees for their focus on performance and execution throughout the year. Clearly, this is impossible without them, and they're critical to our success in meeting not only our shareholders, but our customer commitments. So really appreciate everybody joining the call. Ken, again, welcome to the team. And we'll be talking to you all soon. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may now begin, Mr. Kratz. Mark Kratz : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. Yesterday, we published our first quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. As a reminder, today's discussion will include certain constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. I'd now like to turn it over to Chris. Christopher Kubasik : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since the merger of L3 and Harris 5 years ago and after strategic acquisitions and targeted divestitures, we have built a company with a national security focus. We have critical technologies in all domains that align to national security priorities and the global threat environment. Responsive space, resilient communications and rocket motors are critical for the future fight. The trusted disruptor strategy and our portfolio are setting the stage for L3Harris to differentiate ourselves with top line growth while simultaneously increasing our industry-leading margins. The global security environment continues to be one with heightened tensions and regional conflict. Domestically, Congress recently passed the 2024 Appropriations Bill, which included $844 billion for defense. Our programs are well funded, and we are positioned for profitable growth across much of the enterprise. Demand remains strong for our products and solutions as we started off the year with a 1.06x book-to-bill ratio. Internationally, we continue to see a strong and geographically diverse pipeline of opportunities. As an example, we were recently awarded a $150 million program to provide secure networking to Taiwan, displacing a long-time incumbent. This win is an integral part of our interoperability and supports the CJADC2 mission. Turning to tactical radios. We maintain a robust international pipeline of over $10 billion, including several FMS cases, primarily for Europe, totaling more than $1 billion. These opportunities, along with the continued strong backlog, give us confidence in an international tactical radio ramp in the second half of the year. Other international opportunities are supported by the DoD's supplemental funding, particularly in Ukraine. Earlier this week, the President signed a foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that includes $67 billion in funding for key defense programs. L3Harris has been a key supplier in Ukraine since the start of the conflict, and the need for this equipment remains strong. Our products are being used in theater and exceeding expectations. The supplemental bill will provide our allies access to needed capabilities while at the same time support the U.S. defense industrial base, including small and midsized businesses. With the bill just recently passed, we will give you more information during the next earnings call on the incremental opportunities that it provides. Our workforce is proud to support our country and its allies around the globe. Turning to 2024. Our strong first quarter results reflect improvement across our diverse set of programs and products. We're executing on our contracts and improving cost and schedule performance, which helped drive net positive EACs for the second consecutive quarter. In our product businesses, we are improving quality and driving higher on-time deliveries. Turning to programs. I see development risk abating. This is not to say that we're out of the woods on all of our development programs, but the business is performing well and the disciplined bidding focus and programmatic rigor is starting to pay off. LHX NeXt cost savings are also starting to contribute, and we see that benefit accelerating in 2024 and 2025. Ken will cover the financials in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that revenue was up double-digit year-over-year and operating income was up $150 million, resulting in margins expanding 80 basis points to 15.1%. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 margin EPS and revenue guidance while reaffirming our free cash flow commitments. At our Investor Day, we committed to $1 billion in LHX NeXt gross cost savings by 2026, focused on optimizing our workforce infrastructure and supply chain. The initiative will enable us to maintain our industry-leading margins while investing in technologies, tools and systems to support our customers and employees. We are accelerating our LHX NeXt activity in 2024. And earlier this month, we implemented a workforce reduction that will result in about 5% fewer people than when we began the year. With these reductions, we are focused on eliminating noncore processes, streamlining our organizational structure to maximize efficiency and rightsizing our physical footprint. To summarize. Our actions to date have put us ahead of our gross run rate savings target of $400 million by the end of the year. There's more work to do, and I am confident in our LHX NeXt leadership team and know that our collective efforts will yield the $1 billion savings target, as previously committed. Operationally, we continue to make progress within our Aerojet Rocketdyne segment. Since closing the acquisition, we've implemented processes and tools, which have helped reduce late deliveries by 20%. We've returned multiple programs back to green, and we continue to work with our customers and the DoD to accelerate and improve deliveries of these critical products and to support future growth. Aligned with that growth, it was recently announced that we were selected to be the primary propulsion provider for the Missile Defense Agency's next-generation interceptor. We anticipate this to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the life of the program. Outside of operations, our finance team saw an opportunity to refinance some variable rate debt and replace it with fixed rate notes, saving 150 basis points. On capital deployment. We increased our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year, and we were able to get back into the share repurchase market in Q1, executing about half of the 2024 share repurchase target. We expect about $1 billion in gross proceeds from the previously announced divestitures, which will largely be used to reduce our leverage below our 3.0 target ratio. We remain focused on achieving the financial framework we laid out at Investor Day, and our first quarter results are a solid step forward towards delivering on our commitments. I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide additional perspective. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Chris. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported solid gains of $5.5 billion, including over $900 million for SDA tracking Tranche 2, nearly $150 million for U.S. Marine Corps and SOCOM handheld tactical radios, and an international award for a NATO country for missionized business jets that leverages our domestic ISR capabilities. Backlog remains at over $32 billion and supports margin expansion opportunity as we move forward given operational improvements and recent bidding discipline. Revenue grew 17% and 5% organically with growth in 3 of our 4 segments. Revenue at IMS reflects aircraft procurements in Q1 '23, resulting in lower sales in Q1 2024. As Chris mentioned, operating margins expanded to 15.1%, up 80 basis points from improved operational and program performance while also starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt. EPS grew 7% to $3.06 per share primarily from segment operating margin performance, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income. On a pension-adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was up over 10%. Free cash was an outflow of $156 million as first quarter cash flows are typically the lowest of the year. As you will recall, we derisked 2024 cash taxes at the end of '23, and we remain confident in delivering free cash flow growth this year to $2.2 billion. I'd now like to turn to some segment details for the quarter. I highlighted earlier that revenue grew 17% from the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and organic growth in our SAS and CS segments as we continue to see strong demand for Space Systems and Tactical Communications businesses. On margins. We drove operational improvements throughout each of our 4 segments. In SAS, we are making progress on development programs, including the recent launch of 5 L3Harris missile-tracking satellites as part of the SDA tracking Tranche 0 and HBTSS programs. With these space investments and risk largely behind us, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the new growth areas and maturing processes as we move forward. These efficiencies were a contributing factor in expanding SAS margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. We made progress on program performance, resulting in a $75 million improvement in net EACs versus the first quarter of 2023. These were driven by improvements in all segments as our focus on operational rigor continues to pay dividends. This was most prominent in our CS segment, where the Integrated Vision System sector saw stronger results. The Tactical Data Link business continues to perform well as we realize synergy benefits of a consolidated business within our broadband communications sector. And in Tactical Communications, which drove solid results with an increased level of lower-margin DoD deliveries, we anticipate it will continue through the first half of the year. On capital allocation. Our plan remains the same. We will continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet before we look at opportunities to accelerate share repurchase beyond offsetting dilution. During the first quarter, we returned over $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Moving on to 2024 guidance. We are tightening our revenue range of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion, while we reaffirm our free cash flow commitment of $2.2 billion. We are increasing total company margin guidance for the year to greater than 15% versus prior guidance of approximately 15%. This increase is most notable in SAS, where we now expect margins of approximately 12%, up from prior guidance of mid- to high 11%. Outside of operations, we are also updating our guidance for pension income. At the end of last year, we combined the acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne pension assets with our own. Our actuarial update is more positive than our new outlook, so we have updated those figures accordingly. Lastly on guidance. We are increasing our earnings guidance to a range of $12.70 to $13.05 per share, up from prior guidance of $12.40 to $12.80. From a modeling perspective, I would continue to point out that our CS segment will have a heavier DoD tactical mix in the first half that has less margin opportunity than international programs. Interest expense will also remain elevated in the second quarter. Both trends should reverse as we make our way into the second half of the year, along with a second half-weighted free cash flow profile. Overall, a good start to 2024, and we remain focused on executing to deliver on commitments to our customers and our shareholders. With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Noah Poponak : Chris, I wanted to ask, you have the trusted disruptor strategy, and you've talked about you've been trying to prime more and kind of growing the profile and the size in the sector and that's been working to a degree. Now that we're seeing, I think, some new entrants in the space, try the same thing and maybe have a little more success than they've had in the past, how do you think about that? I mean does that crowd that effort for you? Or is the pie big enough for multiple companies to do that? And then, Ken, just one clarification on the LHX NeXt. Will you -- will all of that be adjusted out of earnings? And is all of that cash or some of that noncash? Christopher Kubasik : All right. Noah, thanks for the question. Yes, I think our strategy is working, as I said, and the portfolio is well aligned. Relative to the pie between the supplemental and the fiscal year '24 budget, we're well over $900 billion. So I think there's plenty of DoD funding. Relative to the new entrants, which sometimes I like to think of us as one since we're 5 years old, but I know where you're going with your question. We've taken the approach to team and work collaboratively with these new entrants at the highest level. So a lot of the new entrants tend to be a little more software-focused. I think the traditional, including ourselves, are a little more hardware-focused. So we're working collaboratively. There's been some recent awards in Q1 where we are actually a subcontractor to a new entrant that want a significant program. And sometimes, they work under us. So I would say we're embracing them and working collaboratively with them. And of course, I've talked about our Shield investments in the past and working with those venture capital companies who are much smaller but also have great technology. So I think it's working, and that's been our approach. Ken? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. No, from an LHX NeXt perspective, we are adjusting out the implementation costs of the program and certainly then trying to leverage the benefits of LHX NeXt in the businesses. We talked about what that target looked like for 2024, and the businesses are off working hard to operationalize that and reflect that benefit in their performance. And I think you're starting to see that here in the first quarter. And then from a cash perspective, we're primarily just adjusting out the cash severance costs related to the program. And you'll see all that reflected in the schedules to the earnings release. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Look, we've gotten the feedback relative to our disclosures. So under Ken's leadership, we're trying to cut back on these onetime non-GAAP adjustments and be much more transparent. So I think it will be all laid out clear for you to analyze. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : Chris, how does the win on NGI with your partner, how does that impact your outlook for Aerojet? And also considering as you mentioned, the fiscal '24 supplementals, do you get more bullish about your ability to hit that $26 billion target -- $23 billion, I should say? Christopher Kubasik : $23 billion and $26 billion? Yes, absolutely. No, NGI, which is designed to protect the U.S. against evolving long-range ballistic missile threats, is a huge win for the OEM. We were a merchant supplier, as I've talked about before, on both teams. So this definitely gives us a tailwind.  When we looked -- I went back and looked at our deal model, this really was not factored in when we made the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. So from that perspective, it's going to be accretive, at least, to our own internal goals. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a great technology, especially with the large solid rocket motors. But the quantities are still to be determined. It's going to start as a development program.  We're in discussions, obviously, with the Prime. We haven't actually been awarded and signed a contract yet. But as you saw in the media, we were selected as a propulsion provider. So it's very exciting. And again, I think it will be a slower ramp as you would imagine. But '25-'26 time frame, I think we'll start to see the revenue hit our financials. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Kristine Liwag : Since you formed a new Business Review Committee back in December, can you give us any color on how progress has been? What are the key areas that have come under focus? And how this compares to your LHX NeXt pipe initiatives as well?  Do they overlap? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, Kristine, it's Chris. We did set up the ad hoc Business Review Committee of the Board comprised of 4 Board members, as you saw. We've been meeting a couple of times a month for a few hours each. And we brought through a variety of topics that have been laid out in the charter that we filed in the 8-K. I would say from anything from operations, we've looked at the programs, they've reviewed the program review process, the bidding process, the LHX NeXt strategy and goals. They've reviewed the portfolio, our capital deployment strategy. And we're just kind of checking through the items in the charter. Some topics are one meeting, some topics are 2 meetings. I feel like we're about halfway through the process, maybe a little more. And then probably middle of the year or so, the BRC will report out to our Board of Directors with observations and recommendations and findings. So I'd say it's been a very collaborative process. I think it's been good for the company, and it's a good way to orient some new Board members quickly about the company and what we're trying to accomplish. So I'd say all is going well to this point. So more to come. Operator : The next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS. Gavin Parsons : Wanted to ask on the nearly 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. If there's a way to parse that out between the drivers? I know a lot of them go hand in hand, but how much of that is NeXt versus EACs, repricing for inflation, mix and so on? Just if there's a way to think about what the drivers were in buckets. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Gavin, it's Ken. I would say that we're seeing improvement in the kind of the high-level buckets across the board. I would say we're seeing some mix benefits in terms of, as Chris mentioned, kind of moving out of some of the development phase of contracts and into some of the more mature phase.  From a mix perspective, we are seeing some of the areas of the business that are a higher mix of cost-plus growing. So as an example, space within SAS was a strong grower and has a bit of a higher cost-plus mix. So that kind of works the other way a little bit. But we are seeing some of the disciplined bidding start to come through in terms of confidence in our ability to perform as well as price discipline and then just performing on our programs and certainly LHX NeXt contributing. And I wouldn't want to put numbers on each of the individual buckets. But largely, as we think about kind of how you bridge from last year to this year for the most part, each of those major buckets are contributing. Operator : The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Peter Arment : Chris and Ken, you've made a lot of progress already on -- starting on LHX NeXt. And I think about 1/3 of it is tied to your gross saving targets, is tied to labor reductions. You recently made an announcement there. If you could just give us a little more color on how you think things will evolve on what's optimal for LHX and then in related to all the actions that you've been taking. Also on portfolio shaping, just in terms of any future kind of thoughts that you've had on further shaping the portfolio. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No. Thanks, Peter. So yes, the workforce is probably the quick hitter for what we need to do for LHX NeXt. And as you said, that got us about 1/3 of the way there. The next part is going to be a little more timely and a little more complicated. And the facilities, I think, are going to be a key part of it.  Looking at the infrastructure. We have a goal of getting from 275 facilities down to 200. We have about 7 or 8 that we've identified that we'll start the process here in the second quarter. So that will have a little bit of cost to move and relocate and consolidate, but these would be smaller entities that the business case is better to consolidate into a larger facility. We're continuing to reduce our ERP systems. We've invested in some technology called the unified data layer to get us access by laying on top of all of our systems to be able to get data more quickly. And then, of course, we talked about the initiatives in IT. Ultimately getting, believe it or not, from 98 data centers -- I'm sorry, 85 data centers down to 2. So that's the infrastructure. That's going to take some time, and that's why it's going to lead into 2025 and 2026.  We've already kicked off with the indirect procurement. We've effectively outsourced that, taking advantage of the buying power of that enterprise. So that's both a combination of price and quantity. So we're tracking to that. And then ultimately, we called it the supply chain, but it's really beyond the supply chain. It's the integration of all the functions that are critical to our products with the overall goal of reducing the cost of our products. So there's an engineering component, there's clearly a supply chain component, contracting and such. So that process is ongoing, but that's where we're going to get the next $600 million or so of savings.  To your question on portfolio shaping. As you know, we have 2 that are in process. I'll just give you an update there. The antenna business, which we announced, a couple of hundred million dollars that's tracking to close the middle of this year, second quarter to be specific. And then our commercial aviation is going to be more in the second half of the year. That'll give us the $1 billion of proceeds. Relative to the rest of the portfolio, we're just taking a hard look at that. We're going to be able to hit our leverage ratio based on these 2. And to the extent we can get a good price for what we've identified as noncore, we'll do it. But too many of the offers are coming in low, and people think we're desperate to sell, and I can assure you, we're not. So we need to get better valuations before we proceed on other transactions. Otherwise, we'll keep and run the business and go forward from there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Jason Gursky : Chris, would you spend a few minutes kind of walking around the Communications business? And maybe give us some updated thoughts since you last reported out on the funding environment. We've had fiscal '24 that got passed; '25, they got introduced. We've had some supplementals as well. And just kind of give us your take on how this plays out over the next couple of years and maybe offer up some comments on Link 16 and the expected refresh of all that hardware and when that kind of hits. Just what have we learned here over the last couple of 3 months on the Communications business? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Jason. So let me start with Link 16. Again, we have a footprint on 20,000 platforms, and then there's variations of Link 16 and other data links that we've developed that are going to be able to go into those platforms or footprint. So I think we're starting to see that. Our ultimate goal was to get Link 16 into space.  I can tell you for the SDA transport opportunities that are coming up, our team is going to be a merchant supplier. And as of now, it looks like we're going to be on all the teams providing Link 16-type capability and space. So we're excited about that. Relative to the Communication Systems, I want to reiterate the opportunity that we won in Taiwan, $150 million for networking, which was a cross-company win led by our Communications segment. So that's a big deal for us. And as I mentioned, it really supports the CJADC2 initiative that our country has been talking about for quite some time.  Relative to the radios, I mean, this is just absolute good news. I know we've been talking about modernization, not only here in the U.S. but globally. And as I mentioned, we have 6 FMS cases that are currently going through the process, through the system in Europe. The backlog is going to be record backlog. Even in Q1, we were able to get the marine and the SOCOM radio orders booked.  And there's a certain capacity and ability to deliver out of our Rochester facility, And it really comes, to be honest, how quickly we can get these supplemental funds under contract and approved and delivered. And with our trusted disruptor strategy, our business model actually allows us to potentially deliver radios within a week of getting the contract, depending on the configuration in the country.  So the way I look at it, we have high confidence in the guidance we've given. We clearly have the second half ramp up. But which countries will get which radios will really be a factor of when the funding turns into a contract. And those that don't get signed and delivered in 2024 will clearly be 2025. So just feel better about the business in a huge way. And again, the products, our in-theater being tested daily, and they're working and exceeding expectation. And the whole focus on resilient communications is paying off. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Kenneth Herbert : Chris and Ken, maybe just a 2-part question. First, on the Communications segment. You, obviously, did 24% margins in the first quarter. The guidance implies some slight ramp in the second half, but it clearly sounds like with international mix and maybe a little bit of a depressed second quarter, there could be some upside to that. Can you just talk about if there's anything onetime in the segment in the first quarter? And any puts and takes there we should think about as we think about the second quarter? And then just -- or the second half of the year. And then just at a higher level, obviously, international seems to be a growing business, maybe faster than the U.S. Can you just talk about longer term, the margin impact of the international opportunity within the CS segment but then more broadly? Kenneth Bedingfield : Sure. I'll take that one. So the first part of the question on CS margins. We delivered 24% margin in the first quarter, which I think was great performance by the CS team. And that does reflect a higher domestic mix than we saw late in '23 as well as a higher domestic mix than we expect to see in the second half of '24. We did guide low to mid 24% margin for CS for '24. And I think what we're trying to communicate is that we expect the domestic mix to be kind of consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. Solid performance could yield similar results. But in driving that margin up to the low to mid 24% for the full year, we are looking at some international opportunities to realize some additional margin benefit as we think about that kind of full year impact. And I think -- so that's what we're trying to communicate on CS margins from a Q1 and full year '24 perspective. And then from the international side. Clearly, as Chris talked about in his prepared remarks and in response to Jason's question, a lot of international opportunity at certainly the CS segment. But as we look beyond that as well, we see international opportunity, in particular at IMS and certainly, the other segments have international components to their business. We don't necessarily track some of the ultimate end customer quite as closely in some of those. But the international margins tend to be stronger across the board. In my remarks, I talked about an ISR program by a NATO country. We would expect that would have strong margins as we, again, think about how we make those deliveries to our international allies and our country's partners, and recognizing the different risks and channels that come with those programs that should you perform, and we expect to be able to perform, will generate higher margins for the business. So we do see that continuing to move into the business.  I will comment, CS clearly is the kind of the quickest-turn segment, the shorter-cycle segment in terms of ability to take international orders and turn it into sales. So just an example, that ISR program we talked about will be a multiyear program, and we'll see that kind of move into the revenue over a bit more time. But with that, I'll turn it to Chris for a few more comments. Christopher Kubasik : Yes, Ken. Just as a reminder, we're in the low 20% of our revenue comes from international customers, and part of our margin improvement strategy is to grow our international business. And just as a reminder, about half of that is foreign military sales, which has margins consistent with the DoD work for the most part, and the other half is direct commercial sale. And that's where we tend to have the higher margins. But as Ken said, more international is synonymous with higher margins, and that's where our focus is. These supplementals are a big step in the right direction. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Can you hear me, guys? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, we can. Gautam Khanna : Terrific. I just had 2 quick questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us more granularity on the RF tactical backlog book-to-build trends. You mentioned something on SOCOM. And if you could just talk a little bit about overall mix this year and perhaps next in that business? And then I had a question on IMS EACs and if those have turned positive? And if not, what sort of still holding that segment back with respect to kind of the profit accruals? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. From a tactical radio perspective, I would say we're -- had a solid bookings order in the quarter. We've got a very solid backlog for that business at this point in time, looking at a multibillion dollar backlog in that business. And for a pretty quick turn, our shortest-cycle business, that is a very robust backlog at this point in time. So we're excited about the opportunities.  I would say the Marine Corps and SOCOM opportunity is a great one as we continue to expand that partnership with that very important customer for the business. We were also down-selected for the Air Force Next Gen Survival Radio, which is a great opportunity for that business to expand into a new market as well. And then clearly, the supplemental as Chris mentioned, and the international opportunities, so I think a huge opportunity in terms of really strong backlog at the Tactical Communications business. And as Chris mentioned, a great business model that enables them to kind of turn that factory pretty quick to deliver the radios to appropriate customers as needed based on critical demand and critical needs on the battlefield.  At IMS, in terms of -- I think the question was about EACs. And I would say that as we talked about in the prepared remarks, every segment performed better from a net EAC perspective. IMS was a part of that, significantly better performance than Q1 '23. IMS is our longest-cycle business, and it takes a while to kind of turn those programs and the operations and get everything working through the system. I think IMS had great performance in the first quarter at 11.4%, working towards the guidance that we put out there for IMS for full year '24.  And strong performance on their programs, I think really starting to stabilize both the operations in terms of rates, realizing some of the benefits of LHX NeXt as well as all the hard work that the sectors within IMS segment are doing to deliver on their programs. So we're really excited about kind of the stabilization and the continued strong performance as we look out into the remaining quarters of '24. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Richard Safran : Chris, Ken, Mark, I wanted to ask 2 things about Stand-in Attack. It was an opportunity for to be prime. And correct me if I'm wrong, I think you decided to no bid. We're hearing a lot more about too much risk being pushed to industry. One of your competitors just talked about adjusting for that in their bids. So I was curious about what your thinking is about bidding going forward. And what's the next opportunity for you to be prime? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Richard. I think I've been pretty consistent on the -- on our bidding strategy. We talked about the bidding discipline. It's been referenced a few times. There's 2 things going on there. A lot of people in this industry sending an inordinate amount of time and money trying to focus on a price-to-win strategy and hiring outside consultants. And we kind of find that interesting but irrelevant, so we've taken a different approach. What is our labor? What is our supply chain? What is overhead? And what's a reasonable fee? We add that up, and that's the bid we put in. And if it's deemed too high, we move on. And if it's appropriate based on our past performance and capabilities, we book the order. So that's a little bit of a change here over the last year or so.  But more importantly is bidding the right types of contracts. And I think in Stand-in Attack weapon, it was a fixed-price contract for development, again, with fixed priced options. And we will not bid any programs where we are asked to give a fixed price on an option for a product that's yet to be developed. It's just plain and simple common sense. I think there are some people in the department that agree with me, and maybe there are others that don't. But you see what happens. In most of these negative EACs across the industry, when you do a root cause corrective action, more times than not, it's a bad contracting vehicle. Nobody is perfect, and there are performance issues, but you cannot perform of a bad contract. And that's what we're trying to do, I guess, on next opportunities to prime.  I mean we have -- and again, we take an approach where is the best approach, either be a merchant supplier or a subcontractor or a prime based on our capabilities and what the customer needs.  There was an Armed Overwatch. We've been successful there. We just got the delivery order 3. So we're up to 25 aircraft already. HADES, which is a big opportunity for the Army. It's the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System. It's basically up to 14 aircraft. We're bidding a global 6,500. This aligns clearly with our ISR and other capabilities. So that would be a big win for us. We have some maritime, undersea ranges where we've primed, and there's some follow-on opportunities, a bunch in classified space. I usually get a space question for now, but I'll just plug that we had no satellites in orbit at the date of merger. We launched 6 in the quarter, and we've been awarded 60 SATS as prime, and there's more in the pipeline. So those come to mind just off the top of my head. And of course, we have a lot of opportunities at Aerojet Rocketdyne. And those are follow-on, but those are not prime programs. So I guess, SDA. I was thinking SDA Tranche 3 for tracking. As you know, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 0, 1 and 2 for a total of 38 satellites. We should get an RFP in the fourth quarter for Tranche 3, and that could be another 18 satellites. So hope that helps, Richard. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. David Strauss : I wanted to ask about the performance in the quarter. I think well above your full year guidance. So how are you thinking about that? And then if you could just touch on 2 programs out there in the press a lot where you're a supplier, F-35 Tier 3. And then how you're [indiscernible] those. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks for the question, David. Appreciate it. I think you were breaking up a little bit, but I believe the question was about SAS performance in the quarter. And solid performance by the SAS team in the first quarter, 12.3% margin rate. And they are performing well on their programs. We talked a little bit about some of the drivers there, including maturing some of the development programs. And we also talked a little bit about the mix. And as space continues to grow, that's a little more cost-plus mix. That could temper a little bit of the margins in the last 3 quarters of the year.  But we did update guidance for SAS to approximately 12% on the margin rate. They were 12.3% in the first quarter, some upside from EAC adjustments. And as we saw strong program performance, you've got to kind of book that in the quarter.  You do -- it does result in a higher booking rate as you move forward, but you do pick up some cume catch adjustment that flows through in that 90-day period versus the full year impact where that gets tempered a little bit. But we're very confident in the team at SAS, and we're confident in the guide that we put out there for approximately 12%. And I know the SAS team is out there working hard as we speak to try to figure out how to drive that up from there. Christopher Kubasik : And I think second part of your question was F-35. Our production deliveries are tracking. We have a ramp coming up in production here starting next month. So we continue to have good relations with Lockheed. In fact, I was just talking to them yesterday. They'll be starting to deliver aircraft, as you know. They'll comment on that themselves. But as they start delivering aircraft, we're going to have to ramp up even further and quicker. And that's our plan. We've made the investments in most of the infrastructure we need. So continued improvement month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. And it's all about the core processor, and that's where the focus of the team is. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : Chris, I wonder if you could comment on the international pipeline at IMS in particular. You mentioned the award in the quarter, but just curious if orders are kind of starting to move there. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean at IMS, we did get the NATO Electronic Attack Aircraft. And this -- we were thinking back on this not that long ago. I mean this is something about 8 years ago, 9 years ago. We talked about disrupting the market, and I always give the space example. But it feels like we pretty much invented and created this biz jet ISR market. We have over 50 biz jet orders in the last 8 or 9 years on 5 different platforms.  So we have this one opportunity that I mentioned in Europe, NATO country. There's some longer-term opportunities kind of in the Mid East. These things take a year or 2 to get booked. So the biz jet market for electronic attack, ISR, whatever capabilities, are still out there. There's a huge opportunity in the Far East that we're on our third bid relative to being down-selected. So that could be a couple of billion dollars in 2025. So very excited about that. Armed Overwatch, we're starting to get interest from international customers. Once we start making deliveries later this year or early next year, I think that market is going to pick up from the aircraft side. And we still have some C130 capabilities that I believe have some international opportunities.  Maritime, we're doing a lot of work with Australia. So we continue to see opportunities there as well. Viper Shield is actually out of SAS, but great capability on F-16 EW. So I see that growing as well. And then, of course, WESCAM with the turrets, that's just a high-growth market with opportunities pretty much all over the globe. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Chris, maybe I'll just add real quick on to that in terms of Armed Overwatch, so beyond biz jets at IMS. We did get a delivery order 3 on that program for 9 aircraft, I think, bringing the total order to 25. And to your comments, I think as that program matures, gives us greater confidence in the international opportunities for that aircraft. So looking to the building confidence on that one. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Sheila  Kahyaoglu: In the past, you guys have talked about revenue synergies with a lot of discussion today focused on LHX NeXt, which is clearly great because your profit was up over 20%. So Chris, you mentioned Taiwan, and you won a bid over a 20-year incumbent. Maybe is there any way to think about potential share gains and investment? What it means for the revenue top line outlook over the next few years? I know you laid out mid-single-digit targets, but how do we think about your revenue growth and market share gains? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We're being selective in where we invest and bid. And if I look at the different domains, I think space is a perfect example where we are absolutely taking a market share. And as I said earlier, we've been awarded 60 satellites as a prime just since the merger, including 38 for SDA tracking alone.  And there's -- it's a hot market. But every couple of weeks or months, you can pick up a paper and see there's one less company in this market, a lot of [ SPACs ]. A lot of companies are withdrawing from that market. And we take that as a sign of our success. We're making money and we've disrupted the market. So I feel really good about what we've done in space.  The airborne domain, I think it's really going to be more with -- what I referenced with the business jets. Maybe Armed Overwatch, to a lesser degree, where again, we're filling in gaps and replacing long-term incumbents are giving them different platforms, with better capability for the missions that they want.  Our maritime work on the undersea ranges is world-class. Again, you go back 6 years, we had no work in that regard, and we found an opportunity to unseat a long-term 40-year incumbent and came up with a different solution. And it's been well received around the globe, as an example.  We've talked historically about our torpedo launch and recovery system using unmanned undersea vehicles. That market is a hot market, in my opinion. We just have to get out there and get a couple of customers, and I think that could be a real game changer for our undersea business. On the radios. We talk about the radios, a lot of good work there. An exciting one that we haven't really talked much about is for the Air Force, which is the Next Gen Survival Radio. So we're 1 of 2 companies competing on that. And in a couple of years, we could be down-selected a new market. And another example, dislodging a long-term incumbent.  And then, of course, innovation in cyber. There's something going on there every day, and you kind of have to innovate daily to stay ahead of the threat. And we're doing that and seeing good growth and good performance in that domain as well. So I hope that answers your question. Operator : Our last question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Chris, when -- I mean, right now, you're looking at Aerojet Rocketdyne, and demand in that market is just getting better and better. And you talked a little bit about the NGI win earlier. But when you look at the demand there, and I think back to -- I remember a year ago talking with you about the situation at Aerojet Rocketdyne, Camden, for example, and how serious the bottlenecks were in trying to get production up? So when you look at the business now, can you see the potential to ramp up? Can you talk about what kind of growth you could potentially get from that business? And then where you stand in the process of being able to get those bottlenecks out and really move production higher? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Doug, great, great question. And yes, it was about 16 months ago when we announced this acquisition. And I think I agree with you. When I look at where we are now, the business case gets better and better. The demand, there was no conflict in Israel. People thought Ukraine would be done. Nobody anticipated a $900 billion of defense spending for 2024.  So the tactical missiles, the nuclear deterrent, NGI, just tons of opportunities on SRMs. Over the long term, call it 5, 7 years, double-digit growth on the top line does not seem unreasonable to me. We have to, of course, invest in the capacity. The bottlenecks, some of them are based on low yields and performance and supply chain. I think we've made good progress in that regard, investing in our suppliers, getting additional suppliers.  I continue to think the more money the government can give to the supply chain, the better off we are. I continue to believe we don't need an additional solid rocket motor prime. What we need is someone working on the igniters, the nozzles and the cases. And I think that would help unlock the potential. We've ordered equipment to continue to expand, whether it's mixers, ovens. They, unfortunately, tend to have a 50-, 60-week lead time, but we've placed those orders. And once we get that in, I think it's going to be -- help with the ramp. We have DPA money to build some buildings, take existing facilities and modify them. So the consolidation and [ piece ] dividend and Budget Control Act for a decade kind of stifle the ability for companies to invest and grow and inconsistent demand signals. But right now, I think everything is a potential tailwind. And we'll have the factories digitized by the end of this year, and we're making the investments and fixing the processes. So pretty excited about it. And 2024 is kind of catch up and continue to burn down the delinquent backlog and simultaneously invest and put in processes. But I think by the time we get to 2026, 2027, if all stays as is, it's going to really turn out to be a great acquisition. So I appreciate the question, Doug. And let me just wrap it up. And first of all, thank the workforce and the leadership team for a great first quarter. Obviously, thank you all for joining the call today. And Ken, Mark, myself and the team will be engaging with many of you in person in the months to come. So thank you all, and have a great weekend. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Danny Gittsovich, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you Dan, you may now begin. Daniel Gittsovich : Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. Yesterday we published our second quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We have also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. Today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. For those of you I haven\u2019t met yet, I am new in this role and look forward to engaging with you in the near future. I'd now like to turn it over to Chris for some remarks. Christopher E. Kubasik: Thanks, Dan and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call with us. Last month marked the five-year anniversary of the transformative merger between L3 and Harris, and the creation of the industry's trusted disruptor, a proven alternative to both traditional primes and new entrants, focused on relentless innovation to deliver capability with the speed, passion, and determination that our customers demand in executing their most challenging missions. Unlike traditional primes and new commercial entrants, we utilize both commercial and government business models with significant presence in each. We deliver commercial short cycle products, such as software-defined radios. We also execute on critical long-term programs that span the entire life cycle from development to production, including international exports, and ultimately sustainment and support. Our diverse and platform agnostic portfolio enables us to work across the ecosystem as a prime, a sub, or a merchant supplier to deliver the best solutions for our customers and the best returns for our shareholders. Further, as the trusted disruptor, we are actively looking for opportunities to partner with small and large companies where it makes business sense. It was one year ago that we announced the successful addition of Aerojet Rocketdyne to the L3Harris portfolio. This acquisition increases our content on missile platforms and positions us for growth in new markets. A recent example is our role on the missile defense agencies' next-generation interceptor program. This leverages our industry-leading propulsion technology and innovative attitude control systems to defend against long-range ballistic missile threats. We are also integrating legacy L3Harris electronics capabilities. Since closing the acquisition, and as we've discussed on our last two earnings calls, we've made substantial progress in improving the operational performance of the business, and we continue to make investments to increase capacity and drive efficiencies to meet our customers growing demand, including the expansion of key facilities in Arkansas, Alabama, and Virginia. As a result of these combined efforts, we have reduced overdue deliveries by nearly 40% in the past 12 months. Several of you had a chance to visit our inert center of excellence in Huntsville, Alabama, and we know you left with a better understanding of the business and the progress to date. Since the merger, we focused on integrating and shaping the portfolio to align with national security priorities and the future of warfare. We are in the right businesses spanning all domains while earning the highest margins in the industry with further upside potential. Looking forward, we remain committed to meeting the expectations of our customers and creating additional value for shareholders and our second quarter reflects progress towards achieving these commitments. We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, highlighted by segment operating margin of 15.6%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.24 up 9%. These results underscore our focus on execution and driving profitable growth. On the demand side, our pipeline of domestic and international opportunities remains robust, and our total backlog stands at $32 billion. In our communication system segment, we ended the quarter with record backlog of over $6 billion from increasing demand for our resilient communication products. This is driven by DOD and international customers needs for seamless, resilient communications across multiple domains as they face increasingly sophisticated near peer threats. We continue to work with these customers to help them avoid the inherent vulnerability that comes from relying upon commercial communication and satellite network providers for their critical missions. Our tactical communications business continues to see growing international demand for European and NATO allies, totaling more than $1 billion in the near term opportunities, and a continued robust pipeline of greater than $10 billion. Overall, we are continuing to see plenty of opportunity for resilient communications, propulsion, and ISR to highlight a few of our capabilities. We continue to make strides in our operational performance, which is reflected in our expanded margins. Programmatically, we're beginning to realize that benefits of our maturing risk management processes and disciplined bid rigor, as well as the initial benefits of our LHX NeXt Program, and that is showing up in our program results. Our first half performance provides confidence for the remainder of the year, leading us to increase our guidance, which Ken will discuss in more detail. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our LHX NeXt initiative. In the second quarter, our efforts focused on workforce and infrastructure optimization, including the strategic collaboration for managed services, designed to accelerate the modernization and automation of our IT infrastructure, while reducing cost and transforming how we operate as a business. We've made great progress, and we're ahead of schedule. The next phase of LHX NeXt is centered around the supply chain management and leveraging the scale of our enterprise. This will improve cost, quality, and delivery for our customers, while simultaneously offering our suppliers demand stability and an opportunity to grow along with us. And for us, it means supply chain management will be a competitive discriminator. Turning to capital deployment, as promised we are prioritizing debt pay down, continuing to maintain a competitive dividend, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and remain on track to meet our stated 2024 target of approximately $500 million in share repurchases, holding outstanding shares flat year-over-year. Aligned with our national security focus, we recently completed the sale of our antennas business, and expect to finalize the pending divestiture of our commercial aviation business later this year, as we satisfy the remaining conditions to close. And finally, I want to thank the four Board Members who served on our Ad Hoc business review committee. Their recommendations were presented to the Board last week, and we are implementing actions in accordance with those recommendations. The focus was on reviewing our strategy and portfolio, program management, disciplined bidding processes, and LHX NeXt plans. The Business Review Committee executed as per its charter, and as such is now dissolved. As recommendations are appreciated, and as I noted, are being executed in a rapid manner to continue to drive value for shareholders and customers. I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide insight on our second quarter results and 2024 guidance. Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Thanks, Chris. I'll start with consolidated results for the quarter. Demand remains high, and in the second quarter we were awarded over $5 billion in new awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of $1.0, and total backlog of $32 billion. We were awarded a nearly $900 million contract for the delivery of electronic time fuses, which play a crucial role in replenishing our nation's critical ammunitions inventory. We were also awarded a $1 billion IDIQ contract with an initial task order of $123 million to supply the next lot of multi-functional information distribution systems, jitters terminals to the U.S. Navy, leveraging the unique capabilities of the TDL product line that we acquired last year. Consolidated revenue grew 13% or 1% organically. Operating margins continued to be strong, expanding to 15.6%, up 80 basis points, reflecting improved operational and program performance across all segments with LHX NeXt cost savings contributing. Chris highlighted our EPS growth of 9% as a result of strong operational performance. I'd like to add that on a pension-adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was up 13% as profitable growth drops to the bottom line. Free cash flow was 714 million for the second quarter driven by increased operating income and improved working capital performance. In the quarter, we repaid a $350 million note which helped reduce our net leverage to 3.2 times down from 3.5 times in the previous quarter. By segment, organic growth within our communication system segment was over 4% from higher production rates and deliveries of resilient communication products. Space and airborne systems segment revenue was flat with growth in space systems and classified programs offset by lower volumes in our airborne combat systems business as we focus on negotiating appropriate business terms. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was also flat as higher volumes on maritime programs were offset by lower volume in our commercial aviation business. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed almost 600 million of revenue for the second quarter. Turning to margins, CS reported margins of 24.4%, down slightly over year, reflecting the timing of software sales and higher DOD revenue mix, which is first half-weighted as we've previously discussed. This was partially offset by LHX NeXt cost savings and the favorable net one-time impact of legal settlements. We continue to expect higher international mix and margin opportunity in the second half. In SAS, margin expanded 280 basis points to 12.6% as we continue to see progress on development programs maturing to production and realize the benefits of our LHX NeXt initiatives. IMS continues to make progress on program performance and LHX NeXt resulting in a margin of 11.9%, a 260 basis point increase versus the prior year. Consistent with a plan to rationalize our footprint outlined at Investor Day, we completed the consolidation of three facilities in this segment in the second quarter. Aerojet Rocketdyne reported margins of 12.9%, which included $22 million of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments. With the acquisition now one year behind us, we are wrapping up the purchase accounting period. With respect to the purchase accounting fair value adjustments for loss provisions and off-market contracts, I'll point out these reflect adjustments to baseline contract performance as of the date of acquisition and are not impacted by our subsequent operational improvements, which we expect to see continuing improvement from in our future margin profile. Simply, the adjustments reflect a more informed assessment of the state of legacy contracts as of the date of acquisition close. Finally, turning to guidance. Given our strong first half performance, we are increasing guidance for revenue, margin rate, and EPS, which we've outlined in our earnings release and presentation. We now expect EPS in the range of $12.85 per share to $13.15 per share, and we are reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. The increased guide for revenue, margin, and EPS incorporates solid growth and operational performance in the first half of the year, and a few more months of additional revenue from our commercial aviation business with the pending divestiture now expected to close in the second half. We're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, highlighted by a year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.03, organic revenue growth of 3%, and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and we remain confident in delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Rob, lets open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Arment : Yes, good morning Chris, Ken and Dan, nice results. Ken, maybe just ask on Aerojet, the margin performance in the first half continues to be really strong, but then you compare it to where the guide is for high 11% kind of implies margin step down. Maybe if you could just walk through that or just the thinking there, is it just conservative, or are there other things that maybe you just mentioned that we should understand? Thanks. Christopher E. Kubasik: Sure, Peter. I appreciate the question. With respect to Aerojet, I would say, look, the business is performing well halfway through the year. We're happy about the margin performance. There's certainly some aspects of mix in terms of which programs are seeing the volumes at which point through the year as well as we performed in the first half, we were able to see some positive program performance that we've got to go do again in the second half of the year. So we feel good about how Aerojet Rocketdyne is performing. And it's been about a year since we've integrated this business, and we're continuing to learn more. I think you saw that the purchase accounting period ended as well. So we've got that kind of information behind us better informed with the improvements that we're making and how we're driving operational improvements in the business. And we'll work to continue to deliver on that in the second half and see if we can replicate what we did in the first half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Seth Seifman : Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Wanted to ask, I guess, Ken and maybe, Chris, as well, when you gave the outlook and the targets at Investor Day it was, I think, about 100 basis points of margin improvement in each business. Now that we've seen starting off pretty well here through the first half of 2024, as you look out, if there are any refinements you might make in terms of how you see getting to that 16% margin and the contributions from the various businesses given how they performed so far and what you've been able to get out of the Aerojet\u2019s next program? Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate it. I would say, as we look back at Investor Day and the midterm financial framework that we set out, growing to $23 billion in revenue in 2026, 16% margins and $2.8 billion of free cash flow in that period. I think where we are today gives us more confidence in delivering to that framework. And if you think about the businesses, they have been performing well. I think we've got the programs performing the work we're doing around, program excellence is paying off. I think that if you look at our guide across the segments where we've picked up SAS margin a bit, same with IMS and CS as well. So -- and then if you look at the business, first half of the year, we're at 15.3% growing from, I think it was 14.8% last year. We're making solid progress towards that 16%. I would say that we feel better about it. And we are trying to reflect that in the guidance updates that we're making again, pickups across three segments. And then picking up margin from where we were kicking off 2024 at about 15% to pick it up to a range of 15.2% to 15.4%. So really making good progress towards that framework. I think we're building confidence quarter-by-quarter. And as we progress through the year and then get into 2025, we'll try to provide better clarity around our progress on that. And again, building confidence and maybe it's something that we'll see some acceleration on. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Robert Stallard : Thanks so much, good morning. Christopher E. Kubasik: Good morning Rob. Robert Stallard : Chris, you highlighted that your margins are some of the best in the defense industry, but at least based on the second quarter numbers, your bookings and your revenue growth are a bit behind some of your peers. I was wondering if that reflects this discipline you've had with regard to bidding terms and contracts in that or is it just -- this is not a fair comparison just for this quarter? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Rob, it's tough to look at one quarter for a bookings or book-to-bill ratio for year-to-date. We're feeling pretty good as to what we've been able to book, had a great first quarter. So one quarter doesn't make a year. I think our portfolio is well positioned, and we're continuing to be disciplined in what we bid. And I think you're seeing that in the results, especially on the margin front. Some of the prior strategic decisions we made to invest and go after prime positions with SDA for satellites, maybe changing our waveform strategy, what we're doing with counter UAS with VAMPIRE winning billable [ph] watch. All those programs are starting to pay off. And as Ken mentioned, we've really upped our program management and execution with training new tools, hiring experienced hires externally where appropriate. And we talk about bidding discipline. Just making sure we have the right contract type. I think we were one of the first to come out and say, we are not going to bid fixed-price development programs with options at the proposal process. And we're doing a lot better, getting the cost basis and asking for a reasonable fee. So we're taking our time, and we're negotiating. And I would expect the third quarter, we'll see a bump relative to the book-to-bill. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Ronald Epstein : Hey, good morning guys. Chris, maybe just a big picture question. We just had the NATO Summit and the Royal International Air Tattoo about a week ago, Farnborough, it really does seem like spending in Europe is on the rise. We've seen that reflected in some of the defense equities in Europe. What opportunity does that create for L3Harris and maybe new markets or things that the European industrial base just can't do themselves. Can you talk about that a bit? Christopher E. Kubasik: Absolutely. I actually was in attendance at the defense summit as part of the NATO Summit in D.C. with the various Ministers of Defense and international customer leadership. And it was a different tone than in the past. And I think you're hitting on an excellent point. I think most U.S. companies don't view Europe as a growth market or even much of a market because of the indigenous capabilities that exist. But the theme at the NATO Summit was all about interoperability and the need for these countries to either bundle acquisitions or have their products work and with the conflict in Ukraine I think everybody sees the benefit of the interoperability, not only amongst the 32 member countries, which includes the U.S., but given the threat profile in Europe. So in our case, we look at our software-defined radios as a perfect example. I think we're uniquely positioned there and there was a lot of interest in that. And back at the envelope, we think this could be 100,000 radio opportunity in the years ahead. So Europe is one of our larger markets that we're now going after for all the reasons you mentioned, Ron. And I think that's a nice upside for 2024 and it should give us some tailwind in the years ahead. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Kristine Liwag : Hey, good morning Chris, Ken and Dan. So maybe wrapping up on the Ad Hoc business review committee, you mentioned that it completed its review. So can you provide any color to the extended recommendations it made and some of the findings. What is now the implementation plan and how is this different from the multiyear outlook you've given at the Investor Day? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Thanks for that question, Kristine. I'll just say I thought it was a good review. We all learned from the process, and I'd say all parties, both the members of the Ad Hoc business review committee and management benefited from the discussion and it has no change on our 2026 financial framework. And the ideas, suggestions, and discussions were beneficial, and we're already implementing some recommendations, and we'll continue to do so throughout the year. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions. Myles Walton : Thanks, good morning. I was hoping to maybe if you could, Chris, drill into the Communication Systems order trends and backlog as you see it sitting here today in the first six months and also from an international perspective, I think it was about flattish growth in the first half and DoD was more driving it and you're expecting, I think, that to shift in the second half. I'm just curious if the order trends are starting to accelerate on that front? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Myles. As I said, we have about $32 billion in backlog way up from when the company was formed five years ago. I guess I really see three major areas. The DoD modernization we've been talking about for quite some time. And if you go back, there was a basis of issue, what we call BOI to buy 480,000 radios from us and our competitors. To date, we've delivered 180,000. So there's still a 300,000 radio opportunity. And clearly, as these IDIQs have annual task orders we've been rather successful in winning our fair share or more than our fair share. And I expect that to continue. During the pandemic, we actually invested in capacity up in Rochester. We've come up with some new techniques. We have what we call our Smart cell, which is a different way of integrating radios. We've seen our yields improve. We're using a smaller footprint and it's really changing the way that we integrate our radios. We continue to invest in software. We have some new wave forms and I think it's important to remember, these are software-defined radios. So the hardware probably has a 10 to 15-year life. So there'll be a replenishment of that. But more importantly, there's a continuous demand for the software and the upgrade. So the DoD modernization as far as we can see, continues to look good, the budgets will come out and they'll adjust the quantities based on that, but there's clear demand here in the U.S. I mentioned the NATO in an earlier question, again, we see a huge opportunity for NATO with that focus on interoperability, and we continue to have success around the globe with our software-defined radios and the whole focus on resilient comms. I think that's one of the lessons learned. There was a big difference between just being able to communicate and communicate in a resilient, protected fashion in our networks are coming out as world-class in that regard. And I've alluded to our software and waveforms. We're continuing to see demand for our resilient wave forms. And this is one of two markets, it is either an upsell for a new software-defined radio or it's a licensing opportunity for the installed base. So just on CS, we have about a $16 billion pipeline looking out three years. As I mentioned, $10 billion international, the rest domestic. So we feel real good about the business and the growth potential and just to close off, we don't see any supply chain issues or constraints as we have in the prior years, which gives us even further confidence in the outlook. Operator : Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. David Strauss : Thanks, good morning everyone. I wanted to see Chris, Ken, if you could maybe dig in to IMS margins a little bit. We've seen nice improvement here in the first half, but it looks like you're forecasting kind of flat to maybe down a little bit sequentially off Q2 in the second half. From what I remember from the Investor Day, the commentary was around that you would move through some of these fixed-price development programs in the second half of the year and if anything we would start to see the margin improvement in the second half of the year, so if you could just maybe address IMS margins? Thanks. Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks, David. Appreciate it. From an IMS perspective, I would say a couple of things. One, we're really happy to see the performance that IMS has had in the first half of the year. I think the programs are performing well, and that's delivering solid margins for us and significant growth over the first half of 2023. In terms of the margin profile between first half and second half, a couple of things. One, we did have some favorable commercial mix in the first half in terms of electro optical, more kind of commercial type of business within IMS. And then we are starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt cost savings, those should endure as well. But from a first half, second half perspective, I think it's two things. One, just the mix commercial. We are going to see growth in IMS in the second half. We talked a little bit about the first half within IMS, having a little bit of growth headwinds with respect to ISR and some aircraft procurements in the first half of 2023. As that abates we may see some mix that moves a little bit more towards ISR, some of the businesses that aren't as highly profitable as some of the commercial businesses in there. But the fact of the matter is we've got to perform in the second half. I think our guide is solid. At IMS, we picked it up to low to mid 11%. We're sitting at 11.7% year-to-date. So I think building confidence in our IMS team and their ability to perform and biggest impact would be the mix as we look at the second half. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Good morning Chris and Ken. So maybe if we could talk about SAS on the top line and bottom line, what trends are you seeing in terms of ongoing growth in Space and Intel with the offset in airborne combat systems? And how do you think about the timing of airborne stabilizing and any context you could give us on the return hurdles you're deploying to have this disciplined profit fall through? Christopher E. Kubasik: Alright, Sheila, let me start and then maybe I'll have Ken chime in. Starting with space, again, I think that is the example. We keep holding up of what the benefit of the merger was in our trusted disruptor strategy. As I've said before, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 1 and 2 for the tracking layer and the RFI for Tranche 3 just came out. So the timing appears to be a little slower than we would have liked, but we're confident in our ability to continue with the SDA. On the transport layer, we've taken the strategy of being a merchant supplier. So we'll have content on the transport layer as well when that is awarded and the classified continues to be a strength. So space and intel and cyber are the growth markets, those are core competencies for us, and that's where the customer demand is. We also have in there our Mission Network FAA work, which is pretty stable, low single-digit growth. And then again, as you mentioned, the airborne continues to have headwinds as a lot of these missions are moving from air to space. And we continue to have great capabilities on mission systems. So to the extent [indiscernible] is awarded, we have opportunities there, CCA, we have opportunities there. And in the interim, we continue to support F-35, F-16, F-18 and the such. So I think it's a story of space and intel growing and airborne continuing to be flat to down based on our customers' strategies and acquisition approaches. Ken? Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes, Sheila, from a margin perspective, I would say as we look at SAS, I think the biggest contributor to margin performance in the first half really has been the implementation of the LHX NeXt program. I think the team there has really embraced the program worked really hard to get their cost structure where it needs to be and think about kind of how we deliver capability as we look forward. Secondly, I would say we did take on, and Chris mentioned a great example of it, which is SDA where we took on some challenging development work. It was a near adjacency moving out of high-resolution weather imagery into missile defense with similar sensors. And as we work through those development programs in 2023 and now we are moving into the production phase, so off of Tranche 0 into Tranche 1, increasing quantities and then starting to see some volume as we move into Tranche 2, I think it's a business model that's really starting to pay off for SAS. So feel good about not just the margin profile but I think importantly, some of the bets that we made, really starting to pay dividends in terms of our ability to perform and I think identifying the right bets to make with our limited resources. So feel good about SAS and in particular, I think, very strategic areas of growth in particular space and the Intel and Cyber business, much of which is classified, but real solid opportunity there, and we see, I think, a solid growing and performing business. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe Chris or Ken, just back to Peter's first question on Aerojet. It looks like second half of the year, the guidance implies, I think, maybe a 14% to 18% growth second half over first half. Ken, can you maybe talk about what the drivers are, is that more of the short-cycle volumes, I know you said you were really catching up on the past dues and then if you could just give us what the Aerojet book-to-bill was in the quarter? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Let me Michael, give a little bit of an overview on Aerojet because it's been a year since we closed and 18 months since we announced the deal. So I like to look at this acquisition, as I said, 18 months ago, strategically, operationally and financially. So I'll give some highlights for the first two and then ask Ken to comment on your specific question. I will tell you, we're not going to disclose book-to-bill by segment at this time. So I appreciate the question, but you're not going to get an answer to that one. But strategically, I think as I've said before, and I'd say, again, I feel much better about this acquisition today than I did 12 months or 18 months ago. And it's clear that the demand is well in excess of the supply and you see that by lots of companies wanting to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to enter this new market. So we are well, well positioned. And I think when I look at our portfolio, this is one of the faster-growing opportunities for L3Harris. Operationally, there were some serious challenges that we've talked about. We've upgraded the talent pretty much across the board. We've doubled our on-time deliveries in 12 months, and we literally have thousands of overdue deliveries that we've cut by 40% in 12 months, our project will be 60% reduced by the end of the year. So we have red yellow green programs. We're getting more and more green programs each quarter. The customer relation is great. The technology is a discriminator. I can go on that longer if someone wants to know, but we have two pulse solid rocket motors. We have liquid and solid divert attitude control systems, Hypersonics is a huge opportunity over the long term. And we're continuing to invest. We're breaking ground in Virginia next week on a new building. We've opened a couple in Camden. We have our hovens [ph] in arriving later this month. We have new mixers coming in by the end of the year. So everything is paying off. We're investing our own money. We're using DoD DPA money, we're using prime co-investment money and it's a great market, and we love working for our primes and supporting them in their ultimate missile deliveries. So I just thought I wanted to give that context as to how much progress we've made in 12 months. Ken, do you want to answer the financial questions? Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure. Yes. In terms of the profile, Michael, I would say we've very clearly been focused, and we talked about this on previous calls, I believe, really focused on integrating Aerojet into L3Harris. We've overdelivered, I think, on the integration savings and now the team is really focused on the long-term health of the business, the operational improvements that Chris talked about. And we're really not trying to drive the business for any particular quarter results. I will mention, Aerojet is primarily on the cost-to-cost percentage of completion, basis. And as we look at the second half, we've seen as we're working with the supply chain that we should start to see some deliveries from our suppliers accelerate, which will drive some of the growth in the second half. And as we continue to see that business grow, I think that profile will continue to build for us, not just in the second half of 2024, but into 2025. So I think the business is being positioned very well. And as that work has been done and a great job by the Aerojet team in doing that, I think it really enables us to start to focus on to Chris' point, delivering product, working with the supply base, working on the facilitization, the equipment, the improvements that we're making and using that kind of as a baseline to start to drive the growth and the opportunities that we see in Aerojet. So I feel really good about that. But I would say the biggest thing is just really working with the suppliers and getting the product in the door so that we can get the critical capabilities out to our customers. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. Scott Deuschle : Hey, good morning. Chris, I appreciate the earlier comment on not disclosing book-to-bill by segment, but I always found that disclosure to be pretty helpful when I'm trying to do analysis around what future growth would look like. So I guess is that disclosure something you contemplate bringing back at some point or do you just view it as not being relevant anymore? Thank you. Kenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes, Scott, it's Ken here. I would say from a growth perspective we're providing guidance for the year by segment. I think we've -- in the Investor Day, given a solid midterm financial framework with our growth of $23 billion in sales. And in terms of kind of how we guide, what we guide, and when we provide information, we're comfortable with the process that we're working through and feel like we've given a good set of transparency with the guidance across each of the segments. And book-to-bill itself can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I think it's more relevant to think about on a long-term basis, and that's why we're really focused on providing that in annual disclosure. So we don't kind of get lost in the weeds on any particular quarter scenario. But in terms of the question around book-to-bill at Aerojet, I think we've seen an order or two sliding from the first half into the second half but we're still planning to see a real solid book-to-bill for Aerojet for full year 2024. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Gursky : Great, thanks. One quick clarification question for you, Chris, and then I've got one for Ken. On the clarification, Chris, you mentioned that an RFI or maybe you said RFP, I'm not here on Tranche 3 just hit. Just kind of curious what the volume is going to look like on that compared to Tranche 2, whether it's flat, growing or shrinking? And then, Ken, for you, I was just curious to know whether the success that you're having with the cost take outs end up being a little bit temporal on the margin side of things, meaning that over time, you give some of that back. And I was wondering if you can just kind of help us kind of think through whether these margins expansion that you've seen here is just structurally higher or if we're sticking to the longer-term guidance because you're going to end up giving some of this back, the cost savings that is and I suspect this has an impact on revenue as well, particularly on your cost plus contracts, if there's any way you can kind of quantify the impacts of NeXt on margins temporarily and then what it does to your revenue growth, if anything? Thanks. Christopher E. Kubasik: Sure. So two-part question. Let me address the what I think was SDA Tranche 3 question first. And there, I think, is an RFI that hit the street, and we certainly don't want to get ahead of our customer in terms of what that looks like. But we are excited to be the only company that's been successful on Tranches is 0, 1 and 2. We will be analyzing that RFI and providing responses and certainly bidding as that RFP comes out. And it looks like maybe what was potentially a late 2024 might not be a 2025 acquisition from the government for that particular one. And from a quantity perspective, I don't have that precise number in front of me, but I think it's either similar to Tranche 2 or I believe the overall quantity is similar to Tranche 2, I guess the ultimate question is, do they continue with 3 providers or move to 2 type of things. So we'll continue to work through that, but feeling really good about it, and I think we're making good progress on that program. In terms of the second part of the question on LHX margin profile, yes, absolutely we are driving the LHX NeXt program for a couple of reasons, one of which is to enable us to deliver margin opportunity, but also to drive value for our customers as well. And that's not just from a cost perspective but also includes schedule as the trusted disruptor, the ability to listen to our customers, and respond quickly and provide capability at pace. But in terms of the specifics with respect to the cost savings, we have estimated roughly that about 40% of the savings will accrue to the company in terms of additional margin opportunities. So against the $1 billion of savings, we talked about essentially $400 million of opportunity from a margin perspective. And we'll certainly work hard to continue to drive up both the amount of the savings, as I think we're executing well on LHX NeXt and moving towards and gaining confidence towards our $1 billion target. So we'll work to make sure we get at least that amount. And then obviously, working to see if we can maintain as much of that as opportunity for margin improvement benefit at the company as well. You may remember at the time of the merger, we did realize I think, something between 50% and 60% of the integration savings. LHX NeXt is a little bit more of an enduring kind of three-year program versus the quicker integration. And because of that, we're projecting that a little bit more of it will accrue back to the government, which is a good thing. It enables us to be more competitive, win more new business as we look forward. But we'll certainly be working to see if we can find ways to realize margin improvements. And it may not be direct improvements out of the program, but as we return cost savings to the programs, and they can think about how they perform better and are able to turn that into future profitability that we can bank down the road for future program performance, we'll certainly think about that as well. So I think the -- at the end of the day, the story is LHX NeXt, we are performing very well. I think we're ahead of schedule. I think we're building confidence, got more confidence today than we did just a quarter ago, and we will certainly work to drive as much of that into margin opportunity as we can. So thanks, Jason. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran, Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Richard Safran : Chris, Ken, Dan, good morning. I dropped off for some reason so if you've answered this, I'll ask something else to ask you. I thought you had some pretty solid free cash flow in 2Q beating expectations. You took up your operational guide but you maintained your $2.2 billion free cash flow guide for the year. Just wondering if you're expecting some working capital headwinds in the second half or maybe baking in some conservatism due to some risk with collections in the second half, so I thought maybe you'd elaborate on that a little more? Christopher E. Kubasik: Sure, Rich and I appreciate the question and it hasn't been asked previously so we're good on that front. In terms of free cash flow guide, we're at $2.2 billion for the year. And as I think about halfway through the year, we're roughly 25% to our full year guidance. It's certainly not a profile that we are uncomfortable with. It's kind of about where we are normally this far through the year. We've got a fair amount of cash to generate in the second half, but we're comfortable, absolutely reiterating the guidance at $2.2 billion. And I don't think we're expecting any working capital build necessarily in the second half, but we've got to work with our customers, get the payments coming in the door, work with our suppliers, making sure we're paying the term on those fronts. And the way I would characterize it, similar to Jason's question on LHX NeXt is we're building confidence to our guide and maybe as importantly, we're sticking with our guidance in the 2026 financial framework of $2.2 billion in 2024, $2.4 billion in 2025, and $2.8 billion in 2026. And that's kind of the bigger picture that we're thinking about is how we continue to build confidence into that increasing free cash flow as we grow the business. And quite frankly, as we get the net leverage targets where we need to be, hopefully, by the end of 2024, and we start to deploy capital with more -- a little more of a tilt towards share repurchase, really driving our ability to see some free cash flow per share growth as we look out into 2025 and 2026. So feeling really good about it. I think it's a great profile, and I think it's a really solid part of our story with that midterm financial framework. And again, I think we're just building confidence towards that, and I feel really good about it. So thanks for the question, Rich. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your questions. Peter Skibitski : Yeah thanks, good morning guys. Hey Chris, going back years to L3, you guys had done a number of niche acquisitions in the unmanned space, especially unmanned maritime. And I believe all those units came over to L3Harris, but we haven't really heard about the focus on unmanned at L3. I'm just wondering, is that still an interesting area for you, I know that DoD is kind of still experimenting, trying to figure things out but is there anything chunky out there contract-wise that you're looking towards or still early days, just want to get your updated thoughts on that whole area? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Peter, great question. The whole undersea and autonomy markets are growth markets for us. I would say on the undersea, what we're seeing more is on the sea beds, the sensors, a lot of classified work, which are not the autonomous ones. We refer to those as grotto and there's a big opportunity coming up almost $1 billion where we're competing. This would be the third opportunity, we won two already. So that could be a real growth engine for maritime. Relative to the autonomy, we still are doing well on the autonomous surface vehicles. I think the Navy is still developing its autonomous strategy and relative to the unmanned undersea, these are relatively inexpensive products. So we continue to invest. We've had great success with our Torpedo launch and recovery using an unmanned undersea vehicle, which is kind of a game changer. But we can highlight it more, but these are literally -- you sell 20, 30, 40 of these. It just doesn't add up to a lot of money, but it's critical to the mission and we should be able to start seeing some export opportunities here in the years ahead. So still part of the portfolio, it is still doing well. Just the price of the products are relatively inexpensive and probably don't roll up to the materiality to talk about them, but we'll try to do more in the future. Operator : The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Kenneth Herbert : Hey, good morning Chris and Ken. Maybe I wanted to ask Chris on the CS segment, it sounds like there's going to be a nice mix shift for international in the second half. And you called out some pretty substantial opportunities as we think about tactical radios and other aspects of that market. But maybe can you just talk about the competitive landscape and to what extent you're seeing incremental price pressure there on the tactical communications side, in particular, and how you might be thinking about the opportunity to maybe take share, especially in international markets? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Ken. Good to hear from you. Domestically, they tend to split the buys, as we've talked about before, 60-40, 70-30 and such, and we're usually the winner of the majority share. But internationally, it is a winner-take-all environment. And generally, we've had great success. And again, these are relatively inexpensive compared to other weapon systems or products out there. So the price is not really that much of a differentiator and pricing strategy, we have a price target. We have -- we know what the costs are and as you know, we get reasonably good margins in this business. So we don't plan on lowering the prices and the customers see the benefit of our technology and again, the interoperability. So we try to cut a fair business deal. But I feel real good about what we're doing. And we've been able to take cost out through our LHX NeXt initiatives. We're getting dual source suppliers. So we don't have single points of failures across the company, but especially in CF and feel real good about this portfolio and the market opportunities. So I think we're going to be in good shape. I'm not going to mention any specific countries, but there's a lot of big opportunities here in Europe that are going through the FMS process and we should have a good second half of the year. Daniel Gittsovich : Rob, let\u2019s take our last question. Operator : So the last question will be from Gavin Parsons with UBS. Gavin Parsons : Thanks, good morning. Christopher E. Kubasik: Good morning. Gavin Parsons : Guys, I just wanted to go back to the supplemental if you could give a little additional color. I think you'd said maybe there was going to be some additional radio revenue in there. Is that upside potential through the end of the year or into next year, is that more of a derisking factor for the guide? Christopher E. Kubasik: Yes. It's built into the guide. And again, it's always hard to predict the actual quantity and timing and the congressional approval process. But a lot of that money for a variety of countries flows our way, either directly in the radios, a little bit on night vision goggles, and then indirectly through the solid rocket motors supporting the primes for the ammunitions. So I think that gives us confidence and stability in our guide. And as you suggest, some of this should roll into 2025 as we make the deliveries in the next 12 to 18 months. So with that, before we sign off, I always like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. We believe we're truly changing the industry, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished and we've accomplished in the last five years. We're very optimistic about the future, and we look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead. So thanks for joining the call today. Have a good weekend. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone. Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Also, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now at this time, I'll turn things over to Mr. Dan Gittsovich, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel Gittsovich : Thank you, Bob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Chris and Ken. Yesterday, we published our third quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We have also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. Today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning, everyone, and thanks Dan. We had a very strong quarter, and our strategy is delivering results. We achieved record order volume, an impressive book-to-bill, robust segment operating margins and solid free cash flow. We're proud of the progress we've made so far this year, and are confident that we are on track to deliver on the commitments we made to our stakeholders. Our customers tell us that we're agile, fast and fully aligned with their priorities. This empowers us to deliver the right capabilities at the right time, meeting the evolving needs of our nation and its allies. Our business model enables us to operate, as either a prime, a sub or merchant supplier, offering commercial pricing or utilizing the traditional government acquisition approach. This flexibility in our platform agnostic approach, gives us a unique advantage in rapidly adapting to the changing threat environment, and addressing our customers mission critical needs. It also enables us to effectively partner with new entrants, and non-traditional contractors. We've made key acquisitions including Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links, while simultaneously divesting non-core assets. These moves have allowed us to further hone our portfolio, to reinforce our national security focus. Our capabilities in areas like resilient communications, munitions, space, ISR and passive sensing are innovative, allowing us to deliver solutions across all domains, and providing our customers with superiority across the entirety, of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our diversified portfolio limits our reliance on a single program, enabling steady growth with lower variability and a greater ability to manage risk over the long-term. Partnerships are a hallmark of our trusted disruptor strategy. On Wednesday, we announced a strategic partnership with Palantir, working together to deliver advanced solutions to our customers. In fact, yesterday the White House ordered the Pentagon and the Intel agencies to increase the use of AI. So, I feel we're well positioned in this evolving market. We continue to focus on profitable growth. This approach allows us to grow, while delivering sustained margin improvement, which will drive financial outperformance. Growth for growth's sake is not our strategy. We prioritize profitable growth that drives appropriate returns, and cash generation. Our strategy to act as a sub or merchant supplier, also enables us to participate in key strategic programs even when we choose not to Prime. I'm pleased to report that we've made considerable progress on our innovative LHX NeXt program, to transform L3Harris and how we operate. Ken, would you like to elaborate? Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks Chris. We're on track to exceed our 2024 run rate cost savings target of $400 million, and now expect to achieve at least $600 million by the end of the year. We are also confident in our ability to reach our $1 billion cost savings target a year early, and our pipeline provides opportunity for additional cost savings, to exceed the $1 billion target. The accelerated savings give us confidence that, we will surpass the segment operating margin target of 16% that we set at our Investor Day, and we now expect to achieve at least 16% in 2026. This performance highlights, our ongoing commitment to transforming the way we work, improving operational efficiency and program management, as well as aggressively managing all costs delivering value to our shareholders. We are realizing the power of real-time data across all of our systems, ERP, manufacturing engineering, to name a few and even our products, for better decision making. Moving into the next phase of LHX NeXt, our primary focus has shifted from workforce optimization to strengthening supply-chain management, and modernizing our digital infrastructure. By leveraging the scale of our enterprise using modern AI-enabled tools from partners like Palantir, we are improving cost, quality and delivery times for our customers. At the same time, this creates demand stability for our suppliers, giving them the opportunity to grow alongside us. Supply-chain management is becoming a competitive differentiator. Back to you Chris. Christopher Kubasik : We had several key wins during the quarter. In our Communications segment, we won a $600 million Next Generation Jammer contract. Following the cost plus development phase, it will enable L3Harris to establish a long-term jamming franchise, worth billions of dollars in high margin production of airborne pods. These types of wins are critical to driving sustained long-term profitable growth, and reinforce the strength and diversity of our technology portfolio. Another highlight this quarter, was securing one of two positions on a $1.2 billion IDIQ contract, with the U.S. Navy to provide support for the P-8A Poseidon fleet. This contract strengthens our relationship with the Navy within the ISR sector. On the international front, we were awarded three contracts for software defined tactical radios, by NATO allies totaling over $400 million. We began deliveries in the quarter again displaying the speed at, which we can provide capabilities to our customers. The international demand for these resilient software defined radios, with our proprietary waveforms highlights our leading capability in low probability of detect, and low probability of INTERCEPT communications. This is driving our allies to choose L3Harris solutions, over indigenous products with increased frequency. Over the last several years, we have strategically invested in a new mission set bringing important capabilities in space-based missile warning, and missile tracking leading to orders for 50 satellites, five of which are in orbit. Our advanced solid rocket motor technology, also plays a critical role in this mission set, demonstrating our leadership in advanced missile and missile defense technology including hypersonics, counter hypersonics and precise attitude control. This is illustrated by our recent win on the Glide Phase Interceptor contract, as part of an industry team where we will provide two critical propulsion systems, including a large solid rocket motor for the first stage, and an advanced motor to power the third stage of the interceptor missile. This interceptor will defense against hypersonic glide vehicles, a real threat in today's environment. The Glide Phase Interceptor Award establishes another long-term propulsion franchise, alongside our next generation interceptor win earlier this year, where we were part of a different industry team. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ken. Kenneth Bedingfield : As we look ahead to next year, we anticipate growth across key financial metrics including revenue, segment operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. We're on track to achieve our 2026 framework of $23 billion in revenue, at least 16% segment operating margin and $2.8 billion in free cash flow. We do expect the growth rate in '26 to exceed 2025, given budgetary and political dynamics over the next few months. We'll provide more detailed 2025 guidance in January, but these commitments are a testament to our ongoing focus on disciplined growth and profitability. Our financial framework anticipates mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and low-double-digit free cash flow growth, as we achieve our targets. As we reach our near term target debt leverage ratio of 3.0, and deploy excess capital to repurchase shares, our free cash flow per share growth, will accelerate into the mid-double-digits over a 2023 baseline. Let's dive into consolidated results for the third quarter, our fifth straight quarter of strong delivery of financial results versus expectations. We're continuing to see strong demand across the board, with new awards totaling over $7 billion this quarter. This allowed us to achieve an overall company book-to-bill of 1.4 with all four segments delivering book-to-bill of at least one. Our Aerojet Rocketdyne and Communication Systems segments had particularly strong bookings this past quarter, with both recording book-to-bill well above 1.5. Our total backlog has now reached a new record of $34 billion. Turning to the financials, consolidated revenue increased by 8% in the third quarter. Operating margins improved to 15.7%, an impressive 70 basis point increase driven by continuing program execution, and operational performance with strong contributions from LHX NeXt. Non-GAAP EPS grew by 5%, and on a pension adjusted basis our EPS increased by 8%. Our performance so far in '24 puts us on track to achieve the top end, of our full year guidance range of 9% to 11% pension adjusted EPS growth. We believe this is the best economic measure of our earnings per share, highlighting how our disciplined focus is delivering strong bottom line results. We recognize the need to take on risk to grow, and as you can see from this quarter's results, we are managing our portfolio to enable profitable growth and limit risk to digestible single-digit and low-double-digit millions. We generated over $700 million of free cash flow this quarter, with adjusted free cash flow of $728 million primarily driven by increased operating income, and effective working capital management. And we reduced overall debt by $325 million during the quarter, reducing our net leverage to 3.1 nearing our target. Turning to segment performance, we saw strong growth in CS with revenue up 10%, supported by increased domestic and international demand for resilient communications equipment, and related waveforms as well as higher volumes for night vision devices. At IMS, revenue is up 7% year-over-year. This was driven by increased volume of avionics products, higher aircraft integration volume for international and domestic customers, and increased volume for advanced electronics for space and munitions programs. SAS revenue was about flat, due to the divestiture of the antenna business in Q2, lower F-35 related volumes as TR-3 development ramps down and a few challenges on classified development programs in our space business. This was offset by classified program growth in Intel and cyber, and increased volume supporting FAA mission-critical safety of flight networks. On an organic basis, revenue growth for SAS was 2%. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed approximately $600 million to our overall revenue this quarter. We are pleased with the segment's performance and have booked significant new business to support future profitable growth as Chris mentioned. All right, turning our attention to margins, CS delivered excellent margins of 26%, a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by strong performance from higher volumes, favorable high margin, international mix, proprietary waveform license sales and LHX NeXt cost savings. Waveform sales, a focused effort in the last few years are demonstrating our effective transition from hardware centric to software enabled products. IMS also performed well reporting margins of 12.2%, up 30 basis points from the previous year, primarily due to improved program execution driving net positive EAC adjustments in the quarter, as well as LHX NeXt contributions and favorable mix in our commercial aviation solutions business. SAS margins declined to 11.6, largely due to a one-time license sale in the prior year, and the previously mentioned challenges on classified development programs in our space business, partially offset by LHX NeXt savings. Aerojet Rocketdyne delivered margins of 12.6%, which included $11 million of benefit from amortization of off market purchase price adjustments. I'll remind you that these adjustments, were always considered in our guidance. As PPA amortizes off, we continue to expect economic profit of new programs to fill in the gap. Turning to guidance. Given our strong performance so far this year, we are increasing guidance again. We now expect total company revenue of $21.1 million to $21.3 billion, segment operating margin of approximately 15.5%, EPS in the range of $12.95 to $13.15 per share, and we're reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. You can find additional segment guidance details in the earnings release, and presentation on our website. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our strong performance so far this year. Reflecting on the progress the team has made, since I joined L3Harris nearly a year ago. I'm truly impressed, by how we've built on our strengths. Our agility and ability to make fast informed decisions, are clear differentiators and it's this culture of innovation, responsiveness, decisive leadership and being a platform agnostic, honest broker that enables this company to deliver on our customers most mission critical needs, while staying fully aligned with the commitments we've made, to our stakeholders. Looking ahead, I'm more and more confident about L3Harris trajectory. We've established ourselves as the trusted disruptor in the industry, continually pushing to disrupt through innovation, while maintaining a trusted and disciplined focus on operational excellence, and financial performance. The future of L3Harris is bright, and this team will continue to unlock new opportunities to drive sustained value. With that back to you, Chris. Christopher Kubasik : I want to reinforce that our mission is clear. We are here to deliver for our customer's mission critical needs, in an increasingly complex global threat environment. We are proud to be at the forefront, helping to build our nation's next arsenal of democracy. Unlike World War II, it's more than just building platforms. It's the convergence of hardware, software and AI. And we're uniquely positioned for the future. Our team's work is vital to helping the warfighter, ensure the safety and security of our nation and its allies. And we remain fully committed, to delivering the technologies and solutions that will protect and defend democracy. Bob, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Certainly, Mr. Kubasik. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Chris and Ken. Thank you so much. Maybe, Chris, if we could start big picture. You reiterated the long-term target of $23 billion of revenue, which implies an acceleration of organic growth from '24 levels and '25 to '26. So can you maybe talk about the biggest drivers of the acceleration? What's left to capture? What are opportunities that you're looking at given the strong book-to-bill this quarter? Christopher Kubasik : All right, good morning Sheila and thanks for the question. Yes, if you recall in 2023, we had a book-to-bill of 1.21. We're sitting at 1.14 after nine months. And as Ken said, we have a record backlog I believe when I look at our portfolio that we are aligned with the important areas of the U.S. budget, and that will allow us to grow and meet our $23 billion commitment. When I look at CS, we talked about the NATO software-defined radios. There are other opportunities in Europe that we're looking at right now. And just like we talked about last time, we still have a $10 billion international pipeline in CS alone. On the space side, I think there's some well-documented budget pressures here in the near term. But I think given the threat environment. And as the customer continues to move missions from air to space, by 2026, we should be able to see more growth in the out years. In Aerojet Rocketdyne, the operations are improving. We're testing in the supply-chain. We're investing in capacity. That expansion should hit us in 2026, which will enable us to accelerate growth. I mentioned the Glide Phase Interceptor and the next-gen interceptor as well. So, those are large solid rocket motor opportunities that are very, very significant. And then, of course, in IMS, we always have international ISR opportunities, which are a little lumpy. But given our good performance so far in that market, I think that can provide us upside as well. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could touch on the cost reduction effort coming in a year ahead of time. I think in the Investor Day, you talked about when that $1 billion cost reduction efforts was accomplished. You'd have $400 million benefit through the margins. Are you at or near that in '25? And if so, why aren't you knocking on the door of 16% margins in '25? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Let me start with that, Myles, good morning. Then I'll let can give a little more detail. But this is the top priority for me, and the entire leadership team. I've talked in the past as to how we did the easy part of integration shortly after the merger, and we were disrupted with the pandemic. And this is really a Phase 2 of the integration, which we've now talking about the transformation of L3Harris. We are looking at every single function, every line of business. We're down to policies, systems, and really just focused on eliminating non-value, or waste in the systems. So we've been very aggressive. We have a dedicated leader and team focused on this 24/7, and you're starting to see the results. I think there was a lot of skepticism. I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the fact we're ahead of schedule, and it's quite exciting, and we're going to continue to push to achieve that $1 billion next year. And more thereafter, but I'll let Ken talk about the margin impact. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question, Myles. Good morning. In terms of the margin flow-through, I would say we are absolutely tracking to the target that we set. And I think the team is working aggressively, to try to realize additional margin opportunity out of the savings either through, or through a combination of over delivery of the ultimate target. As well as making sure that we can realize as much of the opportunity, in turning the savings into margins as possible. We'll give more detail on 2025 guidance in January. We mentioned in the remarks that 2026 margin target has moved, from approximately 16% to at least 16%. And as we think about that, it won't necessarily be a linear path, but we certainly see opportunity for margin improvement in '25 as well. Remember, these are run rate savings, so we expect them to recur and certainly have long-term benefit. We're certainly focused on the long-term, but we will see benefit in '25 flow-through. And just as we look at it, again, the program is really performing well. The team is firing on all cylinders, and really feel like it's delivering the results that we need. Myles Walton : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Richard Safran at Seaport Research Partners. Richard Safran : Chris, Ken, Dan, good morning. I'd like to ask you about Palantir, if I might, the partnership that you talked about. So two things here. First, what's - if you could tell us what's the investment, and profit sharing arrangement between the two of you. And second, could you go into a little bit about the strategic rationale for doing this? I mean you mentioned complementary capabilities. It seems to me maybe you're looking to avoid a huge technology R&D spend here. But that was my view. I thought we'd get your take on it? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. No, Richard, thanks. There is no upfront investment, or capital for this. This relationship goes back about five years. And before we signed a strategic relationship with another company, we wanted to make sure that the cultures are aligned, our focus on mission was aligned, and there's just a lot of great team work, not only at the top of the two organizations, but throughout the organization. So based on that, we wanted to take it to the next level. This will be both teams looking for opportunities to bid. We have one program where Palantir is the prime Titan. It's a mobile vehicular mobile network, where we're a sub providing the resilient comms, the comms architecture, the comm hardware. There are other programs where we're going to prime, and then there's R&D projects we're working on together. So I would say it's businesses as usual, and it's really putting the two capabilities together. As far as the strategic rationale, I mean, could not have timed to the White House announcement any better that I referenced, if you hadn't had a chance to look at it. I mean they are really putting the pressure on the DoD and the Intel agencies, to use AI more. And I think what our secret sauce is, there's no one company that can do it all. They may think they can, but there really isn't. And our strategy of partnering and working with the best companies in a platform-agnostic manner, I think, is a key differentiator. And to have the AI skills and the algorithms, and the large language models that they have is literally billions of dollars. I don't have billions of dollars in five or 10 years to build it. So, we ought to team and work collaboratively, and could not be more excited about that. Maybe I'll let Ken - and I talked about the customer side, and we also received a few calls from customers as early as yesterday, shortly after the announcement. There's a lot of excitement about this, and couldn't be more proud of the team. But we're also using their products internally as part of LHX NeXt. I don't know, Ken, do you want to give just a couple of examples of how that's helping us. Kenneth Bedingfield : Sure. Thanks. Yes, we're using a Palantir product. We call it the unified data layer, as I mentioned in my remarks, and enables us to look across all of our systems, whether those are ERP systems, manufacturing systems, engineering, labor, other, even to the point Chris talked about in terms of some of the customer opportunities, looking across the data generated out of our products in order to do some of the advanced targeting, real-time targeting and things like that, that are subject to the strategic partnership. But again, back to some of the internals, we're using that data to make real-time, data-driven decisions to drive cost down. We've seen that as a contributor in identifying not only areas for labor efficiencies, factory efficiencies, process improvements, but it is contributing significantly to the supply-chain effort as well. So really excited about the partnership. I think it's one of these where there's certainly benefit on the customer side, and we are realizing that benefit upfront in our internal operations to really show how it will actually operationalize itself for our customers. Christopher Kubasik : And I'll just chime in. We recently rolled out a - for our program managers and their financial analysts, the ability to get data even more timely, real-time. And at the end of the day, Rich, it's all about managing your programs. And the earlier you can get the data, the earlier you can identify opportunities and risks, the easier it is to either realize those opportunities, or mitigate the risks. And it's always been a struggle in this industry to get timely data and it's exciting. Our 800 financial analysts have real-time data, and I think it's going to make a difference in our operations in a positive way. Richard Safran : Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next now to Doug Harned at Bernstein. Douglas Harned : Good morning. Thank you. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. Douglas Harned : In CS, you had good results with native demand for radios. When you look at the outlook here, and I would say first on the Army and Marines side in the U.S. and then on NATO, I guess since its World Series Day, what inning are we in, in outfitting the Army and Marines in the U.S. with next-gen radios? And then, how do you see that playing out with NATO countries as well? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Let me - we'll start with the U.S., where we can't agree whether we're in the bottom of the third or the top of the fourth, but somewhere between those two is where I think we're positioned here with the DoD. There's still a lot of strong demand. I'm proud of the team. We're now upselling our latest waveforms. In addition, to just the software-defined radios, sometimes thought of as hardware, although it's all about the waveforms. That gives us a great, great market opportunity. And every time there's an annual buy. We continue to win. So I'm pretty excited there. I'd say on NATO, it's probably even earlier, or maybe the second inning. And what we're really seeing, is the interoperability absolutely critical within the NATO countries, our resilience, our crypto mods. These are all reasons why NATO countries are selecting us, over their indigenous radio providers, it's a huge, huge opportunity. In fact, we recently won a program with the Netherlands for $1.4 billion over 10 years. That's going through the congressional U.S. Congressional notification process. I think one of the key lessons learned coming out of Ukraine, is the need for this interoperability and the need for resilient comms. And majority of the NATO countries are, in fact, not only signing up, but spending the 2% of GDP that they committed to. We have a couple of opportunities that we won here in Q4, already in Eastern Europe. The pipeline is healthy, and we're real, real excited about the software-defined tactical radio business. And as I said, $10 billion international pipeline. Ken? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes, Doug, just to put a couple of numbers on the U.S. side, to your question about Army and Marine Corps, in particular, the DoD has a modernization cycle. We think that's just shy of 500,000 radios in the current cycle. And almost 150,000 of those have been awarded. We have seen about three-quarters of those about 75% coming to L3Harris, that leaves somewhere shy of 300,000 radios to go. So just put a little bit of numbers behind Chris' comments on the U.S. market, I feel really good about that modernization cycle, and how we're doing against the competitive landscape there. You may remember, there's a competitor or two in the handhelds as well as a different set of Manpack and Vehicular. Douglas Harned : And if I can, as a follow-on. In CS, on ENVG, this is something where it seems like we're on the edge of funding being stopped like every time we turn around, but then you get a next award. How do you see the outlook for the night vision goggles there? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. We're optimistic on the night vision goggles. I think they actually put money in the budget for a change. Usually, it's a zero. And then we go to D.C. and try to get the money put back in. This time, the money is actually in there. I think it's ultimately going to be how IVAS and the virtual reality, augmented reality plays out. I think it's pretty well documented that they're behind schedule, and they're struggling. And the ENVG is a superior product for war fighters. So, I think the two are ultimately going to be used, and there's going to be a convergence. But I think it's safe to say we feel a lot better about the night vision goggle business now, than maybe a year or two ago. And again, some of these DoD procurements are split buys, and we've been winning the majority by a fair amount. As we are meeting our commitments, we're delivering and our competitor is behind. So the Army is always going to award the business, to the company that's delivering and performing. That's what we're doing. And we'll watch it closely, but feel pretty good about it, Doug. Douglas Harned : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Matthew Akers : Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Chris, I want to talk about the progress you guys are making on the cost savings. And obviously, that - a lot of that goes to L3, but a lot of it also goes to your customers, and sort of how they're responding to that? Are they taking notice and better competitiveness maybe helping you convert, on some of those orders you got this quarter? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Matt. As you would imagine, I and my team spend a lot of time in D.C. and with the customers, and it's always flattering when they ask you how things are going and how LHX NeXt is going, or looking at it not only is it cost savings. But a transformation, the use of digital engineering, the ability to make data-driven decisions more timely. I think it gives Ken and I and the team the flexibility as we roll up our new bids. We know what our labor costs are. We know what our materials, we know what our overhead are, and it allows us to either share some of that with the customer, or bid higher-margin programs. We try to split the two. And based on these book-to-bill rates and the win rates, is clearly giving us an advantage, and couldn't be more excited about it. But it's definitely front and center with everybody we meet with. Matthew Akers : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next now to David Strauss at Barclays. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. David Strauss : Hi Chris, so far, the margin progress we've seen has been pretty ratable across the individual segments. As you progress from here up about 16%, how do you see that kind of playing out? Do you still see a kind of similar margin opportunity across the individual segments? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Yes. We do, David. We see it at the segment level. And of course, we see it at the sector level, we have 13 sectors. And the mantra has been everybody has to improve their margins. We have a toolbox on how to do that. As Ken mentioned, the next phase is on supply-chain, both indirect and direct costs. I'm really excited about that. We've had some early progress, and I think the opportunities are great. Again, the hard part is getting all the data. And once we know how much we spend with each supplier, we're able to sit down and negotiate kind of a win-win situation. So, I'm excited about that. 16 is an interesting number. If we look at our 13 sectors, I don't think there's anybody really close to 16, Ken. There's a bunch of people well above 16 and a bunch of people below 16. So the guys making 11 need to get to 11.2, 11.5, 11.8 [ph], and the people making 25 or 30 need to go to 26 and 32. So everybody is going forward, LHX NeXt, an enterprise-wide initiative, the benefits are spread across the company. And I'm excited about the progress. I don't know, Ken, anything you want to add? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. I was just going to say, in terms of the margin progress, LHX NeXt is certainly a big part of that. But I think at the end of the day, it's also the investments we've made in the team, and the tools are performance on our programs, I think one of the big contributors is just solid performance, getting some of the negative impacts out of the system. We talk about bidding discipline, and I don't want that message to come across, as that means we're not bidding new work. We are bidding. We think we have a more effective cost structure than our peers, and that gives us the ability to win and determine what the right amount of margin opportunity is for us, and what the right amount of lower cost is for the customers. So as I look at it, certainly, a piece of it is avoiding some of the lower margin negative program issues, we saw in the past. Certainly, working with the supply-chain, pricing and inflation. We sort of had to deal with some of the inflationary pressures as an industry back during the pandemic, but we're now new programs able to reflect that more appropriate cost. And again, really focusing on kind of bid to win and knowing what our cost is, and I think having a better view that we are more competitive than many of the peers. So it's kind of that combination of all those various pieces that, I think help us drive to the margin upside, and that's what gives us the confidence in saying, we're going to get to at least that 16% in 2026. David Strauss : Great. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up for you, Ken. I think you talked about a low double-digit free cash flow per share growth out through '26. It would imply a pretty significant pivot back to share repo kind of soon here as you approach your target leverage, as I just wanted to kind of confirm that. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, David. That's confirmed. We talked about $500 million in share repurchases in 2025. We have now hit that target year-to-date - I'm sorry, 2024. We have now hit that target year-to-date. In terms of leverage, we're at 3.1, which is near that 3.0 target that we talked about. That should enable us to get back to more value-creating share repurchase levels in '25 and '26. '24, we mentioned we would be at least kind of offsetting dilution from our equity incentive plans, and that sort of thing. So absolutely, I think you're thinking about it right, and we're excited about this as really what we see as one of the contributors, to value creation for our shareholders, that growing free cash flow per share at solid mid-teen double-digit clip. David Strauss : Sure. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Michael Ciarmoli at Truist. Michael Ciarmoli : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, just maybe one quick clarification on the margin performance. Any EACs in the quarter? And then, just on the competitive environment, I guess, specifically as it relates to solid rocket motors. There's been some new entrants. It looks like you've got a collaboration going on with GD and Lockheed and maybe that's targeting your GMLRS program. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to get an update on your sense of confidence in maintaining, or even growing some of your share in Aerojet where you've got seemingly, like I said, some new start entrants, some existing players. So just a general update there? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Great. Thanks, Michael. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Chris on some of the new entrant question as well. Look, from a margin perspective and the question about EAC adjustments, we are, as I mentioned, delivering on our programs talked about we did realize some program pressures, in particular, in the space area on a couple of classified programs that we bid a number of years ago. These are very important programs to our customers. I think they enable critical missions, and we're proud of the work that our team does in that area, certainly realizing some schedule pressure and working to accelerate, and that's been driving a little bit of cost on us. But I think it also represents the power of our portfolio, where we were able to work on some of our other programs, realize some upside to more than offset that pressure, and still generate 70 basis points of growth in margin rate year-over-year. In terms of the EACs, we were positive in three of the four segments. As I mentioned, IMS was positive this quarter. I take that as a real good sign about the performance on their programs and the stability that, that team is generating on their performance. SAS, as I mentioned, did realize some challenges and ended up in the red for the third quarter. But again, we're happy that the team is working together, all growing in the same direction to offset. Again, what are those manageable pressures that we see in a significant growth area for this company. In terms of the question on Aerojet and new entrants, I would say, look, we recognize what's going on. Chris has talked about the importance of partnering, with new entrants as a part of our trusted disruptor strategy. We certainly are doing that in Aerojet as well. And we've got a few partnerships that we're working to see if there's more upside than risk in terms of the new entrants. To the question on GMLRS specifically, we see that as a significant growth opportunity in terms of the customer need, and there's been discussion of significant increases in capacity needed there. We are working hard at Aerojet to increase our capacity, and as the customer there is looking at how they get there, they're looking at other opportunities. We're figuring out how we maximize our share of that opportunity. And that's a significant growing market for us, more than we ever anticipated at the time of acquisition, and certainly at the time of diligence. And the team is working hard, to make sure we get at least our fair share of that opportunity. Christopher Kubasik : I'll just - Mike will give you a little more GMLRS specifically, which I think is with that joint venture teaming arrangement that you mentioned. The Army has recently been talking about a need for 32,000 solid rocket motors a year. We're currently producing based on our capacity, 8,000. We're making investments to ramp to 10,000 to 14,000 call it 12,000 in the midpoint. There's just more demand there, and there is supply. So we welcome the competition. We think we have the best technology. We have the infrastructure. We're building new buildings. We've already bought equipment to ramp up. And just to put it in perspective, just out of our Camden, Arkansas facility, we delivered 100,000 solid rocket motors a year, 100,000 solid rocket motors. So that's just a data point. It takes a long time to develop new rockets, to get them qualified, get them tested. We welcome the competition, but more pleased with the acquisition of Aerojet today, than I was a couple of years ago. The demand is strong and the team is performing, so awesome [ph]. Michael Ciarmoli : Great color. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll take our next question now from Gautam Khanna TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Hi, thanks and great results. Christopher Kubasik : Thank you. Gautam Khanna : I wanted to ask just if you can give us an update on Tech Refresh 3 where that stands? And then, if you could also just opine on the margin progress you've made at IMS, and getting some of those challenges that were there last year under control? Thanks. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. On F-35, I know there's been a lot of discussion on TR-3 in the last several days. I just want to clarify that we're under contract with Lockheed Martin through Lot '19. So we are not experiencing any financial headwinds, or impact from their negotiations. But I will say it's a great team effort. We're all working together on this from the prime to the subs and ourselves, to make sure these aircraft get delivered. And field it as soon as possible. Overall, we're meeting our commitments on TR-3, whether you look at the core processor or the memory system or the cockpit display. So it's been a good effort, to get weekly updates on the progress from the team. And I think the customer's end user and the prime are happy, with what we're doing. So pretty good in that regard. Relative to IMS, you've seen the improvement. They are clearly performing well. We're getting new leadership in place a few years ago. We're investing in systems. The customer relationship is improving. And we're seeing pretty good progress. So pleased with the margins on IMS, and they're kind of getting back to where they were just a few years ago, which again, I don't think anyone thought was possible. But - to elaborate on what Ken was saying it's more than LHX NeXt, it's program execution, it's negotiation. It's identifying when the customer wants changes and getting change orders, they don't want it. We don't get paid for it, we don't do it. but that goes across the board. So good progress all the way around. Gautam Khanna : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Pete Skibitski at Alembic Global. Peter Skibitski : Hi, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thank you, Pete. Peter Skibitski : Just wondering at CS, you guys, obviously, kind of broke the year out between first half heavy, domestic mix at tactical radios, second half heavy international and we're seeing that playing out with the margins. Can you give us a sense of how 2025 might play out just versus '24? Do you expect a similar mix, domestic international in '25 versus '24? Or will it shift one way or another? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Pete. In terms of CS and the margin, I would say a couple of things. One, in terms of '24, we did talk about a profile that was a bit more domestic in the first half, international in the second half, and that's planned out as we expected. Some of the first half domestic heavier mix was a catch-up from a number of international deliveries made in late '23. And then I think the team did a great job in responding quickly, to some of the international demand that we saw. And a number of the awards that CS received in the third quarter, were actually not just booked into opportunities, but they were able to ship products to international customers in the same quarter. I should make sure to highlight that waveform strategy is working. And we saw that play through as a driver of the 26% margins at CS, and over 300 basis point increase in margin year-over-year. To 2025, I would say, look, we'll give more guidance for '25 in January. But I don't necessarily expect to see as much of timing delta between domestic and international quarter-to-quarter, first half, second half. We've got growing demand, both domestically and internationally. And as the team has expanded capacity, expanded testing ability, one of the things that they've done that I think is great at CS is invested in some test capability, where they can test multiple radios on single stands, whether those are for domestic customers or international customers that's driving some efficiency. And because that I think we'll be able to see both growing domestic and international in 2025. Again, as we think about that profile, we'll give you more information in January, but it should be, I would think, a bit more stable in the mix as we look forward. Christopher Kubasik : Yes, I'll just chime in. Our confidence in '25, which we'll talk about in January is, is probably going to be better than it has the last couple of years on CS and in particular, the software-defined radio business. If you recall, in '21, '22, the supply chain was really a headwind as we talked about and kind of hard to deliver radio, if you don't have all the parts. But Ken and I were going through some things earlier this week, and I know you're going to find this hard to believe. But Pete, we actually are confident today that our supply-chain is in better shape today, than it was before the pandemic. So you talk about looking for a silver lining in the pandemic, we have a much more resilient supply-chain. We have alternate parts. We've entered long-term strategic agreements where it makes sense. And I think that's going to give us confidence in that particular sector that we didn't have, not only during the pandemic, but before the pandemic. So pretty exciting progress. We don't go back to the norm. It's the new norm, and it's much better in supply-chain than it ever was. So, I thought I'd share that insight. Peter Skibitski : Yes. No, that's great. I appreciate it. A quick follow-up. So guys, waveforms - are waveforms now even higher margin than international at this point? I don't know if you want to answer that or not, but the way you're talking it almost seems like it is? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, they are. Peter Skibitski : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much and good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. Seth Seifman : Definitely appreciate all the investment that you guys made in Aerojet and the demand there. Just looking specifically at the cadence and in the fourth quarter and just kind of, again, to the low end of the range there, requires a pretty big step-up sequentially and year-over-year. I guess, what kind of gives you the confidence in that? And then, to what degree do we think of that as something that's maybe a seasonal impact, versus something that's kind of breaking free in terms of the pace of sales there? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate the question. At AR, we are making really good progress, as we mentioned, I think, in really operationalizing for the capacity and to realize the opportunities that we see. In terms of revenue growth, it does take time to get some of that capacity increase in place. We're starting to see some of the investments that we made pay off, and that should start to kick in from a revenue perspective. They have been working hard on integration and their own piece of cost management, whether that's integration or LHX NeXt and driving that cost down, has been a little bit of a headwind on revenue. As well as some of the - just the legacy contracts that were in place at the time of the acquisition, hanging around for a little longer than we expected that's also been a little bit of a headwind. But as we look forward to the fourth quarter, there's some timing of supply-chain cost flow-through and things like that, that we see giving us confidence to the full year AR revenue range, for the 2024 guide. So we're feeling pretty good about both. I think most importantly, the long-term trajectory and the investments that we're making, to drive our ability to realize that, as well as the full year guide on revenue and margin rate at AR. Operator : Thank you. We'll go next now to Peter Arment at Baird. Peter Arment : Thanks. Good morning, Chris and Ken. Really nice results. Hi Chris, maybe just get your latest thoughts on just any sort of updated thoughts on portfolio shaping. You've talked about some businesses that maybe you wanted to potentially divest, and just given LHX NeXt all the progress that you're doing there? Just your latest thoughts there. Appreciate it? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, we continue to process. We have a couple of smaller properties that are in the market. So I don't know if we'll be able to get anything closed in Q4, we might announce something and we have a process that we're following. None of these would really I don't think be viewed materially $50 million here, $100 million there type thing. But no, we're really refining the portfolio and the amount of management oversight. The time and effort with these small entities and the strategic value to us sometimes doesn't align. But these are good businesses in the right hands. It's always who's the best owner, and we have a handful that we think others would be better owners of. And we'll keep you informed, but I think of it in a couple of hundred million here or there range. I hope that helps, Peter. Peter Arment : Yes, I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up, Ken. Just since you've been now at L3 for just about a year, just how you're thinking about the opportunities with working capital, and I know you touched upon the free cash flow growth and - just your latest thoughts there? Have you seen any opportunities without LHX NeXt, et cetera? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks. From a working capital perspective, we certainly want to be effective managers of the capital required to run the business. That being said, we are working on our plan for profitable growth, and that takes some investment. And at times, that means now kind of investing in the business, whether that's CapEx, or working capital to drive those growth opportunities. And we're willing to make those investments. We look at that and we see it as being a part of this free cash flow growth that we drive, probably with growth in operating income, driven by, again, that profitable growth at the top line flowing through, with increasing margins as the biggest contributor to the free cash flow growth, but then also effective working capital management being a part of that. But I want to be clear, we are not short termists in terms of working capital. We think about the health of this business for the long-term, and we make those important and hard decisions to invest. And that is enabled by LHX NeXt, managing every dollar of cost. And as we've made difficult decisions around our workforce, around our infrastructure, around the tools that we're investing in to drive benefits and supply chain. All of those things enable us to make the investments needed to drive profitable growth. So, we feel really good about it. The team certainly knows how to do effective working capital management. But really, the growth in the income profit is the biggest contributor to that growing working - I'm sorry, growing free cash flow that we see. Peter Arment : Appreciate all the color. Thanks guys. Christopher Kubasik : Bob, let's take the last question. Operator : Certainly, we'll take that question now from Jason Gursky at Citi. Jeremy Jason : Hi guys. This is Jeremy Jason for Jason Gursky today. Thanks for taking me in. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the trends going on with TDL, Link 16 and your efforts with the proliferated water fighter space architecture programs. You guys have made some like good strides here, and have been investing in facilities to support them. So I was just kind of curious, if things have been tracking as planned? Or what do you think might be next for the company in this area? Thanks. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Thanks for the question. We actually just reviewed the TDL business case with our Board of Directors. We're actually a little ahead of the business case that we presented. We successfully moved everything into our Salt Lake City facility. As part of that process, we streamlined the flow in the operations, hours are down, supply-chain leverage improving, and we've received significant orders. There's a product called BATS-D, it's a handheld Link 16 sold the first one in a long, long time or actually lots of them in a while. So we're really happy with the progress we've made there, Link 16 demos and space are going well. And I talked earlier about making acquisitions that align with national defense and security, and being aligned with the budget and the customer. And here's a perfect example, resilient communications. You've heard us say it for years. I'm telling you that's the future. We're in the sweet spot. We have the technology. We got the workforce, we've got the capability, and we're starting to see it pay off. So, I think with that, I'll just wrap up before concluding, and take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the team, their dedication and innovation continue to drive our success, and transform not only our country, but the industry. This quarter, in particular, we faced significant challenges from tornadoes to hurricanes, yet our teams have consistently risen to the occasion. This resilience of overcoming obstacles is a testament to the strength and adaptability of the workforce, could not be prouder of what we've accomplished together. So despite these challenges, we've made tremendous progress. I'm confident that we're well positioned to build on this momentum in the years ahead. And I thank everybody for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in January. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Kubasik. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude the L3Harris Technologies third quarter earnings call. Again, thanks so much for joining us, everyone, and we wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, January 30, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Gittsovich. Please go ahead. Daniel Gittsovich : Thank you, Joanna. Good morning and welcome. Joining me this morning are Chris and Ken. Earlier today, we published our fourth quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and 2025 guidance. We have also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. Today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris. Christopher Kubasik : Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Dan. We delivered on our commitments for 2024 by executing our Trusted Disruptor strategy and making progress towards our 2026 framework. We ended the year with record backlog that positions us well for the future. 2024 was a pivotal year for L3Harris as we marked the five-year anniversary of the transformative merger between L3 and Harris. The combination formed a new company that now operates differently. We are agile, nimble and fast, while delivering solutions that are trusted by our customers across all domains. We span the gap between the traditional primes and the new entrants, forming partnerships around critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy, allowing us to rapidly meet the evolving needs of national security and modern warfare. Domestically, national and homeland defense remains a key priority for the new administration with strong support for our programs in areas such as space, missiles, advanced electronic systems, cyber and resilient comms. Internationally, we saw strong demand for our software-defined radios, night-vision goggles and munitions, reflecting our commitment to supporting allies around the world. Partnerships remain a cornerstone of our Trusted Disruptor strategy. In 2024, we advanced collaboration with Palantir and venture capital-backed start-ups focusing on AI-enabled solutions and emerging technologies. These partnerships are accelerating a culture of innovation and speed, enhancing our ability to meet customers' needs faster and more effectively. Let me highlight some of our key accomplishments this year. We won the Next-Gen Jammer competition, which establishes us as a long-term jamming franchise worth billions of dollars in production of airborne pods to support the F-18 fleet. Our wins on the Glide Phase Interceptor and next-generation interceptor programs will drive growth in our solid rocket motor business for decades to come. Along with the propulsion content on the previously won Sentinel and Zeus programs, we are solidifying our position as a global leader in large solid rocket motor design and manufacturing capability. We won a $1 billion IDIQ award for the U.S. Navy to provide resilient communications technology to U.S. and allied forces. Over the next five years, our broadband communications business will deliver software-defined Link 16 terminals that are critical to enabling secure and resilient collaboration across air, ground, maritime and space platforms. By integrating Link 16 into space-based assets, we are expanding its reach and utility, ensuring U.S. and allied forces have seamless connectivity and situational awareness across all domains. As a testament to our Trusted Disruptor strategy at work, a team led by L3Harris, partnering with venture-backed startups was selected by the Defense Innovation Unit to prototype a command-and-control system capable of operating hundreds or even thousands of swarming autonomous assets. This project advances the DoD's replicator initiative by integrating advanced commercial technologies to enable collaborative autonomy in all domains. Our open system architecture supports rapid integration of third-party algorithms, providing unmatched scalability and flexibility to meet mission demand. By combining these capabilities with our expertise, we are shaping the future of warfare, ensuring U.S. and allied forces maintain a competitive edge in contested environments. As you saw in the press last week, I recently took steps to strategically align our leadership team to drive sustained profitable growth. Ken has been appointed President of Aerojet Rocketdyne effective Monday, in addition to his responsibilities as CFO. With his extensive defense sector experience, Ken will drive operational excellence and continue our strong performance. Sam Mehta's role has been expanded to lead enterprise strategic collaboration agreements to further elevate our focus on partnerships while continuing to head the Communication Systems segment. We've also elevated the LHX NeXt organization, which has been led by Heidi Wood for the last year and achieved excellent results. She will report directly to me as we continue to drive cost savings while accelerating enterprise-wide transformation. Lastly, I want to thank Ross Niebergall for his contributions to L3Harris first as CTO and then as President of Aerojet Rocketdyne. His leadership has been instrumental in positioning Aerojet Rocketdyne for long-term success. After a distinguished career, Ross has chosen to step down to focus on his family's health and enjoy a well-deserved retirement. I'm also pleased to have been elected Chairman of the Board of Governors for the Aerospace Industries Association, the leading voice for the industry. As our country navigates an increasingly complex global threat landscape, maintaining our technological edge has never been more critical. I look forward to partnering with my industry colleagues, the incoming administration and Congress to leverage the ingenuity of our world-class U.S. talent and drive innovation that strengthens our competitive advantage. Looking ahead to 2025, our priorities remain clear; to drive profitable growth while meeting our customers' evolving mission-critical needs. I will now turn it to Ken to provide details on our financial results. Kenneth Bedingfield : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Let me recap full-year 2024 real quick. Revenue was $21.3 billion, up 10% and 4% organically. Segment operating margin was 15.4%, reflecting continued cost savings and strong execution. Non-GAAP EPS was $13.10. Free cash flow grew to $2.3 billion, representing an increase of 14% driven by earnings growth and effective working capital management. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.5 billion, up 4% organically with a segment operating margin of 15.3%. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.47, and free cash flow came in over $1 billion. Turning to our segment fourth quarter results. SAS delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, down 4% year-over-year, largely reflecting the divestiture of the antenna business. Organically, revenue was down 1% primarily due to lower F-35 related volumes as our TR-3 mission computing hardware transitions from development to a more gradual production ramp. Operating margin was 10.8%, up 20 basis points primarily due to LHX NeXt cost savings and partially offset by challenges on some of our fixed price development programs in space that are in the later stages of completion. IMS delivered strong results with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 9% and margin of 13.4%, expanding by 150 basis points. This performance reflects strong program execution and a favorable mix. We are pleased with the momentum at IMS and feel confident in the strength and resilience of this business as it continues to perform. CS achieved revenue of $1.4 billion, up 5% driven by demand of software-defined resilient communications equipment. Operating margin was 24.4% driven by a heavier mix of deliveries to U.S. DoD customers. We are seeing particularly strong demand and international momentum, winning key programs with NATO allies and expanding into other international markets. But I'd remind you, international and domestic mix fluctuate based on quarterly delivery profiles. Aerojet Rocketdyne grew 5% with an operating margin of 11.5%, up 40 basis points, supported by progress on solid rocket motor production and offset by lower volume in space propulsion. Now let me turn it back to Chris to cover some operational achievements for 2024. Christopher Kubasik : Let me start with our portfolio. We completed the integration of the Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links acquisitions, and we also divested our antenna products and Aerojet Ordnance Tennessee non-core businesses. We further strengthened our leadership position in space, delivering four satellites to orbit for the SDA and one for MDA. Our progress in satellite systems and space superiority continued to gain momentum in 2024, reaching a record backlog of 40 satellites in just five years, a noteworthy achievement considering we started with no satellites as a prime. A significant highlight in our SAS segment with successful completion of the customer's engineering design review for 18 space vehicles under the SDA's Tranche 2 tracking layer program. This milestone confirms our advanced space vehicles, equipped with infrared payloads to detect, track and target hypersonic threats, meets the rigorous requirements of the program. Completing this milestone in just 11 months reflects the speed, agility and expertise of our team. These satellites are part of the Space Forces LEO Constellation, providing global missile tracking and defense. With 38 satellites awarded across tranche zero, one and two, including those already on orbit, we continue to support the efforts to advance integrated deterrents. With the Tranche 3 opportunity on the horizon, we are well positioned to expand our role in building this critical layered missile defense system. Furthermore, this capability positions us well to support the evolving defense needs of the U.S. and aligns closely with the Trump administration's recent executive order directing the development of an Iron Dome missile defense shield for our homeland. We've also made significant progress on our LHX NeXt initiative. In 2024, we exceeded our gross cost savings target by 2x, reaching $800 million. This strong performance provides confidence in our ability to accelerate and exceed our overall cost savings target. We are now expecting to achieve $1.2 billion in cumulative cost savings by the end of 2025, exceeding our $1 billion commitment a year early. This initiative is driving margin expansion, operational efficiency, facility rationalization and enhanced supply chain management. At its core, LHX NeXt embodies the same principles as DOGE, tailored to drive greater speed and efficiency to allow data-driven decision making. We are driving improvements across our operations and supply chain, simplifying and streamlining internal policies to eliminate inefficiencies and monetizing end-of-life assets to sharpen our focus and unlock value. This program enables us to respond more effectively to evolving customer needs while creating value for our shareholders. Back to you, Ken. Kenneth Bedingfield : Turning to guidance for 2025. We expect revenue of $21.8 billion to $22.2 billion, representing organic growth of 4% at the midpoint. Our guidance includes a full-year of our commercial aviation solutions business as we continue to work towards closing the transaction. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be mid to high 15%, supported by continued LHX NeXt cost savings, strong program execution and reflecting investments to drive continued transformation. Free cash flow is expected to be $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion driven by growth, higher profitability and disciplined working capital management. Our guidance reflects appropriate risk posture early in the year and the dynamics associated with the new administration. We assume a continuing resolution through March of 2025 and no other funding delays or impacts. The administration has issued several executive orders that are still being assessed, but are not expected to have a significant impact on our 2025 results. However, as U.S. government contracting officers assess the impact of these executive orders on existing and new contracts, we could see an effect on our Q1 2025 bookings and revenue particularly at CS, which can deliver product rapidly against order intake. Beginning in 2025, following comments from many of our investors, we are revising the reporting of non-GAAP EPS to exclude adjustments for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. This change aligns our reporting with peers and has no impact on our underlying profitability or cash. If this change had been applied for 2024, non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $9.70, reflecting an impact of $3.40 per share. Our 2025 non-GAAP EPS is projected to be in the range of $10.55 to $10.85, representing growth of 10% at the midpoint. At the segment level, SAS revenue is expected to grow to a range of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, reflecting budgetary constraints in the space sector that we expect to abate in 2026. Operating margin is expected to be in the low 12% range. IMS revenue is projected at $7 billion to $7.2 billion driven by increased demand in advanced electronics for space and munitions programs as well as maritime solutions with an operating margin in the low 12% range. CS revenue is anticipated to be $5.6 billion to $5.7 billion with margins in the high 24% range, supported by increasing demand for our software-defined resilient communications equipment. Aerojet Rocketdyne is expected to reach approximately $2.5 billion, fueled by double-digit growth in the missile solutions business. Margins are expected to be in the mid-12% range as we drive continued operational improvements. As we set our 2025 guidance, we want to highlight the varying number of weeks in certain quarters in 2025 that will result in some variability in revenue and EPS between quarters. In particular, Q1 is a short 12-week quarter and should be considered in your modeling. Our capital deployment strategy reflects our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders. We strengthened our balance sheet and ended 2024 with a net leverage of 2.9x, exceeding our target of 3.0. With that achievement, we will maintain a competitive dividend and are focused on repurchasing at least $1 billion of shares in 2025. Additionally, we had another solid year of performance in our pension plan with no significant contributions in 2024 and none expected in 2025. To further derisk our balance sheet, we are working to transfer approximately $1.2 billion in pension assets and liabilities to a third party with little gain or loss and no impact on cash flow, taking advantage of attractive funding levels and interest rate environment. We expect to complete this action by the end of first quarter 2025, resulting in a reduction in non-cash non-service FAS pension income, which is reflected in our guidance. Considering our strong performance in 2024 and our growing confidence in the cost savings that the LHX NeXt program will continue to deliver, we are also updating our 2026 financial framework announced at our Investor Day last year and increasing the segment operating margins we expect to achieve to low 16% in 2026. We are continuing to target $23 billion of sales in 2026, representing 5% organic CAGR and $2.8 billion in 2026 cash, representing a double-digit CAGR with further upside on a free cash flow per share basis. I'm proud of the tremendous progress our team made in 2024. This year has been one of transformation, growth and strong execution, underscoring the strength of our portfolio and the talent of our team. We have faced a dynamic and demanding environment, but our ability to be agile and execute with discipline has allowed us to deliver strong results. From achieving record backlog to advancing key strategic priorities, we have demonstrated resilience, the ability to deliver on our commitments even in the face of challenges and remain focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders. As we continue to build on this momentum, I'm excited about what's ahead. The opportunity before us is meaningful. And our strategic focus on operational excellence and innovation positions us well for sustained profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Chris. Christopher Kubasik : As we look ahead, we remain steadfast in our commitment to driving innovation and delivering mission-critical solutions that align with our national security priorities. As we navigate an increasingly complex threat environment, L3Harris continues to stand at the forefront of innovation and national defense. Our vision for the nation's next arsenal democracy is rooted in the convergence of cutting-edge hardware, software and AI technologies that ensure mission success in every domain. This concept goes beyond traditional platforms. It's also providing adaptable, scalable, open and interoperable solutions that give our war fighters a decisive edge. Whether it's in resilient communications, advanced munitions or space-based capabilities, we are enabling the Department of Defense and our allies to stay ahead of evolving threats. In my recent letter to the DOGE, I outlined key recommendations to modernize the national defense ecosystem. These principles reflect our dedication to advancing efficiencies, strengthening collaboration and ensuring that the U.S. maintains a technological edge. We encourage others to come forth and submit ideas to the DOGE Committee. We are excited to work with the new administration to bring these and other ideas to life and continue playing a pivotal role in supporting the missions that protect our homeland and our allies around the world. The incoming administration's transparency and understanding of the defense industry sets the stage for disruptive change in 2025. We expect a period of unprecedented evolution in defense priorities and policies. With our agility, speed and commitment to innovation, we are well positioned to adapt. This new era presents a chance to redefine how we support the war fighter, and we are excited to play a pivotal role in driving this change forward and seize opportunities that align with our nation's strategic objectives. Our work is critical to empowering the war fighter, who protect democracy, ensuring that they have the tools to maintain global stability. With a deep commitment to innovation and collaboration, we are proud to play a central role in this effort. Joanna, let's open the lines for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Peter Arment at Baird. Please go ahead. Peter Arment : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Chris, Ken and Dan. Hey, Chris maybe just to start where you kind of finished, which is you wrote a letter to the DOGE leaders just before the inauguration, and you recommended for I think policy recommendations. Have you heard any feedback? Or have you had any active discussions? And how do you think this is all going to play out with kind of DOGE and the impacts on the DoD bureaucracy, which I think you've called out many times and just how you're thinking of that. Obviously, it's been an overhang on the group. We've seen a lot of valuations compressed. So I'd be curious your thoughts. Thanks. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Peter. I'm excited about the DOGE, and I tried to parallel the similarities with what we've been doing this past year. And as I think as to how we got as a nation, each and every policy and regulation is put in place to reduce risk, and they're well intended. When you step back after a few decades, I believe the cumulative effect of all these risk reduction policies and procedures have actually created more risk than they've actually resolved or mitigated. So to answer your question, received lots of positive feedback from members of Congress. I was in the Pentagon last week, a couple of other classified meetings. I think a lot of people have read the letter. I'm really just trying to start the dialogue. I think Congress plays a role. I think the DoD plays a role. The war fighter plays a role. And I think it's important for industry to be part of this ecosystem and give their perspective. I know several others have started to write letters. And I threw out four recommendations. There's probably better ones or different ones. It's really just trying to start the dialogue, get people to sit down and say, how can we go faster and get better capability to the war fighter quicker? And I'm excited about the future. And I think, as I said, there's going to be an unprecedented change in 2025. And some will be able to adapt and take advantage of it. We plan to be one of those companies, and maybe others won't. But let's see what the future brings. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Myles Walton : Thanks. Good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Hi, Myles. Myles Walton : Ken, you've got about $150 million of growth in free cash flow in 2025 and then $350 million at the midpoint, placeholder for growth in 2026. Can you flesh out what specifically accelerating? And then also on the increase in LHX NeXt of $200 million, how much of that drops through to actual margin savings versus savings for the customer? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes, I'll take that one. In terms of growth and free cash flow, I think it pretty well aligned with the growth profile that we've laid out. We're growing the topline 2024 to 2025, 2026, a bit accelerated in 2026. As we've mentioned on topline, there's a couple items that are resulting in some better opportunities for growth, 2026, F-35 with TR-3, our hardware development ramp down and then the production ramp being a bit more \u2013 still kind of climbing that ramp in 2025, but accelerating in 2026. There's a little bit of space budget challenges in 2025. We do see the potential to get some space awards pulled into 2025, that will drive 2026 revenue and then a little bit of international opportunities as well at IMS. So a little bit of a better growth profile in 2026 and 2025, continued margin expansion from where we are today to mid to high 15s in 2025 and then low 16s in 2026. And then I would say, effective working capital management, the team will continue to do that. And I think if you kind of run that through, it will support the growing free cash flow profile both in 2025 and in 2026. To the LHX NeXt question, we're still holding to our target of about at least 40% of the savings will result in margin opportunity for the company. And as we look at that, there's obviously some timing of how that works. You got to factor in the percent complete on the various contracts that we've got in place at any point in time. It was certainly a strong contributor in 2024 margin expansion. It will also be that in 2025 and then certainly supporting the 2026 margin expansion to low 16% margin rate as well. So we'll certainly work to try to see if we can drive some upside to that above the 40% cost savings in the margin opportunity. And I think the team is working hard on that every day. But as of now, that's kind of what we're seeing in terms of actual delivery of the opportunity to that target that we set. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Douglas Harned at Bernstein. Please go ahead. Douglas Harned : Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to see how you're looking at the Communications Systems business. There's a lot of things that sort of line in there that seem to allow some real margin upside, the software sales for new waveforms, more exports, commercial contracts with LHX NeXt that could flow right through. But your guidance for 2025 is still below 25% margin. Where is this going to \u2013 where is the potential in margin expansion here? Because it seems like you've got a lot of the ingredients in place to get above the 24% range. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, Doug. Appreciate it. As I mentioned, I'll point out a couple of things. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, certainly, as we're looking at 2025, we've got to go and continue to perform in the business. It's early in the year, and we're certainly thinking about it from a risk-adjusted perspective. CS team has demonstrated the ability to produce product to generate margins. So just in terms of looking at margins for 2025 at CS, I would say a couple of things. One, we're certainly evaluating the mix between U.S. DoD as well as international deliveries. From a software perspective, I think we've talked about that kind of comes in chunks here and there. So we've got to go continue to drive strong deliveries in terms of waveforms that are both integrated into the products and driving high-margin product opportunity as well as waveform upgrades where we really see the opportunity for high-margin business. And then from an LHX NeXt perspective, the CS team certainly has been doing a great job of integrating the cost [indiscernible] for the margin compression that we saw in the fourth quarter really was related to the mix of U.S. DoD deliveries versus international. We're at a higher mix in the end of 2023. So I think the team is doing a great job. I do think we'll continue to work to meet, if not beat, our segment guidance. And I know the CS team will be off and working on that. So feel good about the opportunity, and we'll update you later in the year. Christopher Kubasik : I'll just chime in. Doug, we're seeing finally more and more opportunities to bid and win C2 and C3 systems. So the market is going beyond just selling the software defined radios in the waveforms that you said. So we're finally getting to more of a network and systems approach, and I think that's going to give us some additional tailwind. I think of all the segments, this one probably has the highest inflation impact from the supply chain, given all the electronic components. So we have to absorb and offset that, not only with LHX NeXt, but our E3 savings. But the trend is positive, and we're optimistic. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Chris and Ken. Thank you. Maybe I'll follow-up, Ken, on the $1.2 billion of LHX NeXt or Chris. You raised it by $200 million and 40% drops through to the bottom line, it's about an extra 30 bps on top of your peer high margin. So where are you seeing that come through the most? What's really driving some of those opportunities? And if you could just talk about maybe like KPIs that you track there. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. I'll start and then let Ken \u2013 yes, we're seeing it from a variety of places. Supply chain, I think we're finally had a pretty good year in not only getting the savings, but building the resilience of our supply chain, not only the indirect materials which we probably did first and is a little easier now we're working on direct materials and subcontract management. So I think those are going to be big drivers. We're continuing to look at the facility rationalization and the org structure and roles and responsibilities. So I think there's some additional opportunities, similar buckets to what we had before. But in parallel, we're also, as I mentioned, transforming the business as well and making the investments necessary to digitize the company to allow the employees to get data quickly. And that had also factored into our guidance. So it's just not a $1.2 billion gross run rate cost savings. We're reinvesting in the business, make it an even better and more efficient place to work for the employees. So you net that down. And as you know, even at 40%, the 30 bps comes in over time, as Ken said, depending on the percent complete accounting and such. So I think it's been a huge success and amazing accomplishment. We will hit the 1.2 in two years. And given the size of the company, very proud of that. Tack that on to the $650 million we did right at the merger. We've almost taken out $2 billion of cost in six years, which is pretty impressive in my opinion. Anything else, Ken? Kenneth Bedingfield : I would just add, Sheila, that we certainly delivered on the cost-savings in 2024. A chunk of that was some difficult decisions we had to make around labor, but we did realize some labor savings. That's probably the cost that results in the quickest turn into the savings turning into actual costs flowing through the EACs, working hard on some other opportunities. Chris mentioned supply chain facilities, and then transformation some of the systems and how we work. And those take a little bit more time to flow through the EACs and into the actual realization of the savings. So we're certainly tracking that. So in terms of your question on KPIs, certainly, the generation of the savings, but then also programmatically and through the businesses, how do we track those through to actually delivering on the savings, ordering against new agreements, things like that, long-term agreements and that sort of thing. So I think we've got the right approach. We've got the right metrics. The team is fully aligned and delivering. And I think it certainly continues to contribute to the margin profile 2025 and into 2026. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ronald Epstein : Hi. Good morning, guys. Chris, how are you thinking about the environment right now with regard to M&A? That's to say, with the new administration, maybe things change, and Boeing has got some assets for sale. Is there anything out there that you're thinking about that could be a bolt-on in new technology, maybe an investment in something like more venture-oriented given the push towards some of the start-ups? Broadly, how are you thinking about that? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Good morning, Ron. Great question. I do think this administration will probably be more favorable towards allowing acquisitions. As you know, we made two in 2023. It made perfect sense for us strategically. They did not eliminate competition. And even in the prior administration, we were able to get two acquisitions approved. Relative to the way I look at it there's \u2013 we've really tried to take more and more of this partnership approach. AI is a hot market, and I think we have some interesting partnerships and opportunities. I try to highlight what we're doing with Palantir specifically. We actually have a couple opportunities that we will be bidding on competitively as a team in the next several months that could actually be awarded in 2025 that deal with next-gen command and control and army network modernization. Of course, we have to go win those. But it's easier, in my opinion, to find partners and work with them when it comes to AI and even autonomy. I think we own small parts of up to 40 different venture-backed companies now. So we're pulling that technology through. And the next step, if we do anything, would be a bolt-on type acquisition to fill a niche or to expand the capability. But nothing has come our way yet. We continue to review and get lots of inbound calls, and not many of them get a whole lot of traction. I like the playbook we have. We're transforming the company. We're buying back our stock. We're growing margins. In fact, when we hit our 2026 goals, we will have grown our revenue, margins and free cash flow four consecutive years, just straight up operationally. No exceptions, no exclude this, exclude that. Just good old-fashioned organic growth, margin expansion and free cash flow four straight years. And hard to argue against that playbook, and we're executing on it and proud of what the team has done. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead. David Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. Christopher Kubasik : Good morning. David Strauss : A couple of clarifications, I guess. On CAS, and that divestiture, I think you mentioned it, Ken, but what \u2013 exactly how much revenue is assumed there? And I guess what is taking so much time for that deal to close? That's the first thing. And then EACs, what they were in the fourth quarter and what you're assuming for 2025? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, David. From a CAS perspective, there's \u2013 we're working through some regulatory and other processes in 2024. There are some different joint venture aspects to that and just getting all the parties in the same room and an agreement on that. We do anticipate that, that transaction will close in 2025. From a guidance perspective, 2024 kind of felt like we were hoping it would close, and it didn't. We have kept having to update. So we thought rather than having to update each quarter, we would just include it. And then we can obviously just back it out once when it closes. So we thought that was kind of the easiest way to reflect that business. In terms of the timing, I wouldn't predict it. We do think it's going to be in 2025. And the revenue of that business is somewhere north of $500 million, $600 million in terms of how that business looks. No major impact on trends at the company level from a growth perspective or other. EAC, to your question on that one, we did deliver positive EACs at the company level in the fourth quarter. As well, we delivered positive EAC, positive net EACs for the full year of 2024. So when we file the 10-K, I think you'll see somewhere $40-ish million of positive EACs for 2024. And I think even in the face of some program challenges, we've talked about a couple of classified programs in our space business that are seeing some issues as we work through integration and test-type activities. These are kind of legacy programs that have been around for a while. And as we've moved into prime positions, we're just working through some of the IMT aspects of those types of programs. But even with that, we were able to work hard, generate strong program performance and see positive EACs in 2024. As we look at 2025, we don't really project or predict positive EAC performance. So our guidance generally assumes that we would have flat EACs in 2025. And as we're able to perform on the programs and hopefully generate strong performance and net positive EACs in 2025, that will be upside to our guidance and our performance for the programs and across the segments. Chris, did you want to comment on that? Christopher Kubasik : I just want to, David, emphasize what Ken said on these EACs. And we have literally thousands of programs, and what we do is complicated. And nothing is easy and nobody is perfect, but this team finds a way to deliver on its commitments. And occasionally, there's tens of million dollar challenger, couple of million here, and it just adds up, but we take our LHX NeXt savings. We take our other innovative and creative ideas, and we meet our commitments. We don't make excuses. We don't back stuff out. What you see is what you get. And these margins are inclusive of all the good news and all the bad news. And we're going to continue to run the business that way and find a way to deliver. And I think that's the culture we've built, and that's what the team wakes up every day focused on. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Seth Seifman : Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on that, on the space charges. Should we think about the magnitude there being kind of the difference between the guided margin and kind of where things landed? And then I think you mentioned in the materials that those program were nearing completion kind of how close are we to completing those programs? And how much risk remains? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes, Seth, from a space program perspective, so I guess at a high level, I would say we've got a couple of classified programs we're working through. We are, as I mentioned, at a significant percent complete. We do expect those programs to \u2013 we'll continue to monitor them through 2025. We'll continue to manage risk through 2025. During 2024, we did realize probably about $100 million of negative adjustments or negative EACs across a couple of those space programs. And clearly, as to Chris' comment, as the team works hard, we were able to largely offset that. So that's kind of the way to think about it. I do expect we'll, for the most part, get that risk behind us in 2025 as we think about some customer milestones early in 2026. And given the nature of the programs, I probably can't comment any further than that. But we'll continue to work. I know the team's got a good approach, data is coming in and working through those things. And we're very comfortable with what we've guided for 2025, so. Christopher Kubasik : And I think it's the same story you hear from everyone. A lot of these are fixed price \u2013 a couple are fixed price development programs, some going back seven, eight years pre-merger. And I think I've been pretty clear on my views on these high-risk fixed price development programs. So we have to run through these. And you shouldn't assume in all cases that we're the prime. So it even gets little more complicated when you have to integrate with the prime and such. So as Ken said, we're in the \u2013 we're kind of in the red zone, to use a football analogy, and we just got to get these things in the end zone and continue to grow the missile tracking business, which is sequentially profitable each and every order and focus on the SDA TR-3 win later this year. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ken, I was wondering if you could elaborate on some of your objectives now with your increased role at AJRD? Kenneth Bedingfield : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm really excited about the opportunity. And as we look at Aerojet Rocketdyne, I think the priorities are clear. There is absolutely an incredible amount of demand in the market for solid rocket motors to support critical mission needs of not only our country, but also its allies in addressing the geopolitical threats and issues that are out there. So absolutely making sure that we are increasing our capacity, and we have been making investments to do that. We'll certainly be making sure that we're doing everything we can to drive capacity on the missile side of the business. On the space propulsion side, really looking at how we drive efficiency on that side of the business and really think about how we deliver that capability. We've got, I think, a solid business. It's got like an eight to 10-year backlog and really thinking about how we maximize our performance there, make some investments and position for continued opportunities on that side. And then I think there's some important business there, including the Artemis program, which really is important in terms of returning to the moon. And I think we've been clear that, that's a priority as a country. So very much focused on kind of continuing the leadership there, delivering on our commitments and really trying to get back to growth and increasing profitability and cash flow at Aerojet and certainly continue to make sure that we focus on delivering our commitments from a finance perspective. I would just say I think Chris' and the Board's confidence in allowing me to take on this additional role does highlight the strong team that we've got in place or have put in place, both in Aerojet as well as on the finance side of things. So I am proud of the team that we've built, and I look forward to working with them to deliver results, not just for Aerojet, but also across L3Harris. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gavin Parsons of UBS Financial. Please go ahead. Gavin Parsons : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Ken. Busy guy. Kenneth Bedingfield : Hey. Gavin Parsons : Could you size the drag on revenue growth from the LHX NeXt savings outperformance? And then just a clarification, do the 2026 targets also still have CAS fully incorporated? Thanks. Kenneth Bedingfield : So in terms of the impact on revenue growth from LHX NeXt, as we are driving the cost savings through, it certainly does have an effect on our revenue. And I will remind everyone primarily on cost-plus programs, but it does also impact longer-term fixed price programs as well as those run through kind of the same EAC model. As we look at 2025 and our growth projections, I would think about it maybe as in terms of incremental cost savings, thinking of it as maybe half of that would be a headwind to revenue growth. And then in terms of \u2013 I think the second part of your question was 2026 revenue and Commercial Aviation Solutions business. And in case it wasn't clear, CAS is in 2025 from a guidance perspective. It is not in 2026 revenue from a framework perspective. And again, we wanted to include it in 2025 just so that we didn't have as much noise in the system as we did in 2024, expecting to close and then having to update guidance. So Commercial Aviation Solutions in 2025, not in the $23 billion framework for 2026 revenues. I hope that answers the question. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli at Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Ciarmoli : Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. I guess I wanted to go in that same direction, Ken and Chris. So thinking about CAS and the 2026 framework, what do you guys see in the backlog that really drives the doubling of that growth rate from 2025 to 2026 when you strip out CAS? Christopher Kubasik : Yes. Let me take that one, Michael. We've \u2013 well, first of all, the portfolio, I'll start with our current portfolio. And we look at the national defense strategy and what we think is going to happen. There's going to be a lot of focus in space, maritime, cyber, comms, ISR and munitions. We have a multibillion-dollar businesses in each of those areas. So I think the core portfolio is going to kind of fuel some growth. We talked about some of the challenges that the Space Force has had with their budget, which has been impacting the industry, but I think that's going to correct by 2026. And of course, the whole focus on Paycom or the specific region and the need for comms and network. So I like the portfolio, and I think we're going to get some tailwind there. The prior question about the drag, if you will, from LHX NeXt, yes, it is a drag a little bit in a cost-plus environment or maybe even where we have these truth and negotiation cost and pricing data scenarios, which is why in my DOGE letter, one of the things is if we have competition, let's just get an RFP out, submit a bid and let's go fast. Let's not have 18 months of auditing to do a relatively quick competitive bid. So I think we're going to win more business with a lower cost base, so how I think of it in that regard. I think international, we're still around 21%, 22% of our business is international. There's been a lot out on there from executive orders and such. But at the end of the day, from an FMS, foreign military sales perspective, that money comes from the local countries or is nationally funded by the ultimate customer. So I think that provides a tailwind to us. I think the administration has been pretty clear that they want each of these countries to pay their fair share and/or increase their budgets. That's happening. The other half of our business is direct commercial sale. So that does not even have to go through the FMS process. We're looking hard at the partnerships with AI. I gave a couple of examples with Palantir. I think by 2026, can we get an extra percent or plus of growth from what I call these disruptive partnerships and venture capital and going fast? I believe so, and the team does as well. So when I kind of look at those areas and just yesterday, something popped up on border security, again, a focus of the current administration. We provide all the comms for the customs and border control. We have the comms for the military. It seems that these two agencies are working collaboratively, at least on the southern border. And that provides us opportunity to have that capability synced and network. So I guess between international border and security, AI, our portfolio, our lower cost base, we see a path to the $23 billion. Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. I would just add, Michael. I mean from my perspective, a couple of things, And we talked about this in a little bit on the prepared remarks, but F-35 hardware delivery ramping, space has a little pause in 2025, back to growth in 2026. International ISR, certainly, Aerojet starting to kick in from a solid rocket motor perspective. CS, both international demand as well as the Next-Gen Jammer win, really starting to kick in volume-wise in 2026 as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Richard Safran at Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Richard Safran : Chris, Ken, Dan, good morning. So I'd like to ask you about I think the Pentagon and almost industry-wide is a recognition that the impact of fixed price development contracts, contract without inflation escalators, et cetera. Now assuming you agree, I want to know if you see major changes coming to the contracting environment? Do you think there are going to be more rewards with good execution? And how quickly do you think these changes get implemented? Thanks. Christopher Kubasik : Yes. I have to believe based on everything I've seen and read and the people I've met with, and as a reminder, I think it's only been 10 days since the inauguration. So things are going real, real quick. But there is a desire, an overall desire to go quicker. And I mentioned earlier, the DOGE organization, which is more than a person or two. It's a whole enterprise. I think the ideas and the suggestions are going to come pretty quickly. So maybe by the middle or end of this calendar year, there will be some changes that could affect by 2026. The things that I threw out, as I said, I'm sure there's better ideas out there. These are just policy and the elimination of bureaucracy and regulation. This is, in fact, people that work in the Pentagon, people work in the government, I know they're hardworking and dedicated and doing good work for the nation. They just are hampered by the tools and the regulations that have grown up over time. So I think the companies that are going to win are the ones that can go fast, that can get solutions, that aren't vertically integrated, that aren't closed systems. And I think we're leading the industry, as I said, with these partnerships and kind of straddling and working collaboratively with the traditional primes, working with the new entrants. Sometimes we'll prime, sometimes we'll sub, sometimes we'll be a merchant supplier. I think just having that culture of innovation, speed, creativity and being open-minded to serve the customer is going to play well for us. So I'm hopeful that change comes. And again, executive orders come out every other day. I know some are out. They're rescinded. There's a letter that says this, a letter comes out, says, forget \u2013 don't do what I just said. And Ken hit it well. The first quarter is just going to be lumpiness, right? We read these things every day. A lot of pressure on the contracting officers. Do we all have to modify contracts for DEI? Do we not have to modify them? We'll work through this stuff. I mean the key is we follow the law, we get the guidance, we adjust and we move forward. So I think it might be a couple of bumpy months here as things go back and forth. But again, we have record backlog. We have existing contracts. We have a path to our commitments for 2025. And hopefully, there'll be a change that makes us even more efficient as an ecosystem. Joanna let\u2019s take the last question. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Ken Herbert at RBC. Please go ahead. Kenneth Herbert : Yes. Hi. Thanks for squeezing this in. Chris or Ken, as you look at your exposure to Ukraine, can you level set us on sort of directly or indirectly, how you see that? And maybe then just to put a finer point on the international opportunity, where do you see international growing at for you within the portfolio in 2025? And maybe how much does that accelerate into 2026? Christopher Kubasik : Yes, I'll take the first one, and we'll kind of keep it short. I think we're talking tens of millions of dollars, as I see it. When we talk about Ukraine, we're really talking about U.S. government assistance, which is different than FMS, DCS or such. So we have tens of millions in backlog already. We believe that whether it's in the form of aids or loans or whatever, that will continue and execute and deliver. Termination costs probably equal the cost of delivering the product. And then going forward, we have to see what the policies are. But it's manageable, and it's in that dollar range for that one country, which has historically come through either in aid alone or what I would call broadly U.S. government assistance. I think that is coming to an end. It's a small percent of our international business. And relative to the growth rate on international, Ken, do you want to take that and we'll wrap it up? Kenneth Bedingfield : Yes. Thanks, Chris. And yes, Ken, I appreciate the question. From an international growth perspective, we certainly do see the opportunity to grow international faster than domestic. But I think we see both areas of the business growing. So Chris highlighted, we're a little north of 20% of our revenue from international. Could that grow a percent or two, I think it can. But obviously, the team that's working the domestic opportunities is hard at work trying to grow those revenues as well. So I think they both contribute, to your question on Ukraine. We're seeing significant demand across all international markets, whether it's our NATO allies, Asia Pacific, even Latin and South America. And we certainly saw opportunities to support our ally in Ukraine in 2023 and 2024. There will be beyond the U.S. aid programs that Chris referenced, I think, other countries that may have some opportunities to acquire some capability and provide it to their allies as well. So growing opportunity set. I think international can grow a little bit faster. It could grow a percent or two in percentage of total revenue. But we're growing both aspects of the business. So it's a good problem to have. All right. I'll turn it back to Chris. Christopher Kubasik : Yes, why don't we wrap this up? As I reflect on 2024, I have to say I'm incredibly proud of my leadership team and all the employees for what we accomplished. So I want to thank the 47,000 employees with a focus on performance and execution throughout the year. If you work at L3Harris, you get accustomed to change. The last five years, we've had change on a regular basis. So I think that's going to help us adapt to the change even though we don't know what it is coming forward. So as I said earlier, our strategic priorities remain the same. We have a dedicated and talented workforce. I think we're going to continue to grow profitably. The 2026 framework is achievable. And our focus here is to grow and create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. So thank you all for joining the call. We'll see you in the months ahead, and we'll do this again in April. Have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
