And I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from the Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead. Chelsey Pulcheon : Thank you, Savanna. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to share our 2024 first quarter results. Joining me as CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move into the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2. A reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation and the website archive link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara. Alok Maskara : Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to our customers and employees whose loyalty to Lennox helped us deliver strong Q1 results marked by record profit margins. Specifically, I want to extend my appreciation to our dealers, distributors and key account customers for trusting Lennox to deliver industry leading HVACR products and solutions across North America. The success of our transformational effort to strengthen our distribution network, elevate customer experience, advance innovative platforms, execute pricing excellence and drive productivity can be entirely credited to the unwavering support from our employees and customers. This successful quarter further demonstrates our ability to maintain our growth momentum, navigate complex end markets and effectively prepare for the upcoming low GWP regulatory changes. Now let's dive into the details of this quarter on Slide 3 where I would like to highlight 4 key messages : first, Lennox's core revenue grew 6% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 157 basis points to 15.9% resulting in our adjusted earnings per share increasing 23% to $3.47. Our operating cash usage was $23 million, a significant improvement from $79 million usage in the prior year. Second, Home Comfort Solutions delivered a slight revenue decline alongside moderate EBIT growth. With the destocking effect on volume, counterbalanced by price and mix, we delivered 30 basis point margin expansion, and we are all glad to see the destocking phase nearing its end. Third, our Building Climate Solutions team delivered record Q1 margins supported by both revenue and profit growth. We remain on track for the opening of our new Saltillo Mexico factory in early Q3, which will enable us to fully satisfy customer demand and outgrew presence in emergency replacement market segment. Lastly, we are delighted to announce the updated fiscal guidance for this year as the Q1 results give us greater confidence in our earnings per share range. Michael will provide a detailed review of the guidance later in the call. But for now, let's turn to Slide 4 for more details on the upcoming low GWP refrigerant transition. We are fully prepared and on schedule for the upcoming refrigerant transition. Our product designs, manufacturing processes and technology engineering have all been finalized. We are currently transitioning our raw material inventory to facilitate the product launches, and we plan to start shipping the new low GWP refrigerant product, later this year in time to meet expected demand, we anticipate price increase of 10-plus percent for the new product line. During this low GWP transition, we will face manufacturing headwinds as we convert each production line in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories will effectively balance production flexibility with cost efficiency. Looking ahead, we foresee 2024 as predominantly in R-410A refrigerant year. As we move into 2025, we expect the demand for the new low GWP product to reach approximately half to 2/3 of the end market. This shift in demand will benefit our product mix and also position us favorably to capture market share. Ultimately, we are well prepared and confident in our ability to navigate this transition successfully. Now please turn to Slide 5 for an overview of our initiatives to become a better distributor of HVAC products. As you know, Lennox is a top-tier HVAC distributor in North America with substantial geographical coverage through over 250 outlets supported by more than 25 regional distribution centers. Nearly 45% of Lennox's residential sales are now through our digital platform, lennoxpros.com where our contractor partners also have access to a digital service dashboard for equipment prognosis, diagnosis and monitoring. We have the opportunity to grow our market share by expanding geographic coverage and improve our share of wallet through greater focus on parts and accessories. We also have an opportunity to increase dealer loyalty with improved fill rate and an enhanced customer experience. The distribution network improvements and the 3 core changes highlighted on this page will accelerate our growth and increase our margin resiliency. First, we have established a decentralized and better aligned organization that is consistent with distribution best practices. As a result, local leaders who have better visibility into local market conditions will have increased autonomy for faster decision-making. Furthermore, we have established 5 regional P&Ls led by experienced leaders who are accountable for both regional sales and stores. In addition, we are building our capabilities in critical areas such as revenue operations, pricing excellence and distribution management. This is a long-term journey, and we are pleased with the early progress we have seen thus far. Second, to improve the quality of our customer service, we completed a physical distribution network analysis to ensure that we have sufficient growth capacity and optimal cost structure. We have streamlined and digitized our end-to-end demand and inventory deployment processes, and we are also implementing a modern warehouse management system throughout Lennox. It will take us a few years to fully realize the benefit of these changes. But thus far, we are pleased with the recent trend in our fulfillment rate. Third, we have created customer charter for our businesses and have established Net Promoter Score practices across the company. This allows us to collect feedback and set numerical goals around our customer interactions. We are delighted with the improvements we are seeing in our Net Promoter Scores and know that this is a commitment that will continue to yield results over the long term. To summarize, we are becoming a technology-enabled distributor, and we are investing in talent and resources to support this growth opportunity. While there are early signs of promising results, this is a multiyear endeavor that will accelerate growth and promote margin resiliency. Now let me hand the call over to Michael, who will take you through the details of Q1 financial performance. Michael Quenzer : Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Expanding on to Alok's earlier comments, I'm excited to share our Q1 results, which not only reflect a strong start to the year, but also highlight record first quarter margins and an impressive 23% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Core revenue was $1 billion, up 6% as price gains and revenue from the AES acquisition were the main drivers of year-over-year improvement. Adjusted segment profit increased $25 million, where most of the growth came from $40 million of price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by continued inflation and investment in SG&A and distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was 15.9%, up approximately 160 basis points versus prior year. Corporate expenses were $24 million, which includes $3 million of expenses previously considered noncore adjustments. Beginning in 2024, we will include certain previously categorized noncore adjustments in our adjusted earnings. This approach aims to reduce recurring or immaterial adjustments, which improves our overall quality of earnings reported. Our adjusted earnings will continue to exclude the effects of business divestitures and significant nonrecurring items such as restructuring programs. Our first quarter tax rate was 19.4% and diluted shares outstanding were 35.8 million compared to 35.6 million in the prior year quarter. Now let's direct our attention to Slide 7, where we can review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions Segment. Revenue declined 1% to $681 million in the first quarter. The volume in our 2-step distribution channel continues to feel the effects of industry destocking and was down mid-teens. Our direct-to-contractor sales volumes were up low single digits with solid growth in the new construction channel as new homebuilding starts have rebounded. Price yield was 3%, an improvement from the 2% price yield we earned in the second half of 2023, reflecting our successful execution of pricing initiatives in the quarter. The Home Comfort Solutions segment profit increased $1 million to $112 million, and segment margin also experienced approximately 30 basis points of growth to 16.6%, although pricing initiatives are progressing well, results are still impacted by inflation as well as the ongoing investments in distribution and sales. Overall, given the challenging conditions in the end market, we are proud of our execution to increase profit margins even with volume and mix headwinds. We are prepared to launch the new low GWP product in the coming months and ensure the new product pricing material maintains gross margins. Turning to Slide 8 in our Building Climate Solutions segment that delivered another strong quarter. The Building Climate Solutions revenue was up an impressive 21% this quarter, propelled by 7% volume growth and our best performance in many quarters. Combined price and mix were up 8%, and revenue from our AES acquisition contributed 6% revenue growth in the quarter. Building Climate Solutions profit grew by $28 million or 56% and segment margin expanded 480 basis points to 21%. These results were primarily driven by price and sales volume gains. Our profit results also reflect  $2 million headwind for our new Saltillo Mexico factory ramp-up expenses. Despite ongoing production and supply chain challenges, unit production volume from the Stuttgart, Arkansas factory shows steady improvement. Additionally, we are excited for product output from the new Saltillo factory in early Q3 and we'll launch our new low GWP product in early 2025. We continue to be impressed by the Building Climate Solutions team's strong efforts in executing initiatives to pave the way for achieving our long-term targets. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow used in the quarter was $23 million compared to $79 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $30 million for the quarter, a decrease of $5 million compared to the prior year. Later in 2024, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new Saltillo, Mexico factory and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product. Concurrently, the team is focused on improving processes and generating efficiencies in both accounts payable and accounts receivable. Both items are reflected in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Our commitment to high ROIC drives strategic and targeted investments that enhance our performance and competitiveness in the marketplace. As previously mentioned, the new Saltillo factory and the transition to the new refrigerant products is proceeding as planned and showing positive progress. We also continue to look at bolt-on M&A opportunities that align closely with their overreaching company strategy. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.4x down from 2.1x in the prior year. Our approach to capital deployment remains consistent. We prioritize capital expenditure investments with strong returns, grow dividends with earnings, continue to explore M&A opportunities, and supplement with share repurchases when necessary. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. Turning to Slide 10. Let's review the 2024 full year guidance. Our outlook on revenue provided during our last conference call remains unchanged as first quarter trends performed as expected. As a reminder, I will reiterate a few revenue guidance points. RECONNECT The table on the left highlights full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is projected to increase by approximately 7%. We also expect stable sales volumes with a slight increase from Building Climate Solutions and flat for Home Comfort solutions. Price and mix are expected to drive a mid-single-digit revenue growth where price increases will ensure we remain price/cost positive. As a result of our strong first quarter profit performance, we are also revising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19 to $20 from the previously guided range of $18.50 to $20. Our free cash flow guidance remains unchanged at $500 million to $600 million. Those product and other cost assumptions also remain unchanged. Component cost inflation is anticipated to be up mid-single digits including large increases in our cost to acquire R-410A refrigerant and recent inflation in commodity prices. We expect this cost inflation to be partially offset by material cost reduction programs. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo Mexico factory, along with approximately $5 million to $10 million associated with the refrigerant transition across our home comfort solutions manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year, a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer service, information system advancements and distribution growth initiatives. We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million and our tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. With that, please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back to Alok for an overview of end markets. Alok Maskara : Thank you, Michael. On Slide 11, I will share our outlook on the end markets for both segments, which align with the full year guidance that Michael just went through. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, we have started to see a rebound in residential new construction, signaling consumer health resiliency. Nevertheless, we continue to closely monitor the repair versus replace dynamic amidst macro uncertainties. We are pleased to see distributor inventory return to near normal levels. However, the introduction of new low GWP refrigerant product and pending EPA updates on component manufacturing cutoff dates, does add inventory management ambiguity for dealers and distributors. With that said, we anticipate that most of this year's sales will still come from R-410A products with limited adoption of the new R454B product towards the end of this year. Transitioning to the Building Climate Solutions segment, we expect deceleration in new construction accompanied by potential project delays. However, order rates and backlog remained strong driven by pent-up replacement demand. Insights from our National Account Services team highlight a significant upcoming need for replacements as well as increased interest in our new [indiscernible] services. Our market share prospects in the BCS segment will be driven by volume from the new Saltillo Mexico factory and our expansion in the emergency replacement market. We are also securing additional wins in national accounts with our new integrated offerings made possible due to the AES acquisition. Overall, our outlook for this year remains cautiously optimistic. Given Lennox's track record of success during regulatory transitions, we anticipate benefit from new product pricing and potential market share gain. We acknowledge that the market remain uncertain, but we are confident in our proactive strategies aimed at driving growth, optimizing margins and delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. We do this by focusing on controllables and action items that we can drive. Now please turn to Slide 12. As a recap, Lennox operates in growth end markets, had resilient margins, demonstrates execution consistency and serves with customers through advanced technology and high-performance talent. The 5 reasons we remain confident in Lennox be a great investment opportunity is : first, we will continue to make strategic growth investments to improve our go-to-market effectiveness and support customer demand; second, margins remain a focus as we continue to evaluate our pricing strategy, implement innovative solutions to increase productivity and optimize our direct-to-dealer network; third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, our teams will be able to streamline processes, leverage best practices and consistently execute our strategy; fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers; finally, our team's focus on core values and guiding behaviors, is the foundation of a high-performance culture. Our pay-for-performance incentive structure further aligns the talents of our team with the interest of our shareholders. Allow me to wrap up by saying thank you to each of our dedicated employees and valued customers. I'm proud of all that we have been able to accomplish, and I'm looking forward to the promising future that lies ahead of Lennox, as our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Savannah, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  And our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Thomas Moll : Alok, I wanted to start with a follow-up on the comments you made regarding strengthening the distribution network. You gave us a lot to think about. There are, I think, 9 different points on the slide that you introduced. You clarified it's a multiyear effort, so all very helpful context. And my question there is, if you were to focus our attention on this year and where we should look for early signs of progress where would you focus us, and to what extent can you quantify or frame some of the investments, whether in personnel, technology or elsewhere behind those efforts? Alok Maskara : Tommy, so on the investment side, as you see, our Q1 SG&A is up year-over-year. And so a large part of the investments that we're talking about are already in our numbers, are already in our guidance. Among the -- and this is a classic McKinsey training, right? There are 3 buckets of 3, hence, you get to 9, but that I blame on my McKinsey background or not anything else. The 2 things I would focus on would be both around our customers in terms of fulfillment rate and our net promoter score, which are both indicators -- early indicators of market share gain. And we are seeing solid progress in that. Third thing we will point out is pricing excellence, which is kind of embedded in there, but do you see that in our numbers anyway. The first 2, we don't talk about publicly, but that's what I monitor internally in significant amount of detail, looking at where is our NPS and where is the fulfillment rate. Thomas Moll : That's helpful. For a follow-up, I wanted to ask -- this one probably goes to Michael for a couple clarifications on the raised EPS guidance midpoint. Michael, can you just refresh us on the seasonality here? Is 50-50 still the right way to think about it for first half, second half? And then related point, you mentioned a convention regarding the corporate expense and what is versus isn't included there. Any additional detail you could provide, especially if you can just give us a bogey for what you're assuming for the year would be helpful. Michael Quenzer : Sure. Yes. So on the seasonality from the revenue perspective, we've already mentioned that we think from a revenue perspective, Q1 is about 20% of the year. First half is about 50%, second half is about 50%. That's from a revenue perspective. And then on the items that we've now included in corporate, previously, we had some items for asbestos litigation, environmental expense, unique litigation. So these are kind of just small immaterial noisy items that were somewhat recurring, and it was about $0.25 of items last year that we've now moved into our adjusted earnings this year. Thomas Moll : So that would be... Alok Maskara : If I could just pick you back on. Sorry, go ahead, Tommy. Thomas Moll : Yes. I was going to say, Michael. So that would be a $0.25 unfavorable item from last year to this year. Am I hearing you correctly? Michael Quenzer : Yes. If those expenses are generally flat, which we think they are, yes, it's about a [$0.25] headwind. Thomas Moll : Okay. Got it. Sorry, Alok. Alok Maskara : Yes, Tommy, I was saying we did that just to improve the quality of our earnings. I mean, these items are small. They became more recurring, and we think we should only exclude onetime items, extraordinary items. So this was just a bit of a cleanup as Michael came into this role because this was a good opportunity to take these items, which had all become recurring for past many years. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Maybe just talk to me about residential. You called out negative mix. So I want to understand what's going on there. What are you seeing on repair, replace because we noted in our checks kind of discernible change more recently. And just as we go into the selling season, given kind of a weaker 4Q, 1Q, kind of what's the lean on kind of industry volumes for the year? Alok Maskara : Sure. If I could start on the mix for the first part. The mix that you're referring is just residential new construction, which was subdued last year is now coming back, and we sat and that's lower margin to us compared to replacement. So that's kind of the mix impact we were calling out that we've noticed. On the repair versus replacement, I think the jury is still out. I mean, I've read your channel checks, we've talked to our dealers, kind of depends on which part of the country and which dealer. We haven't noticed any significant change in part sales versus equipment sales, but we probably wouldn't be the first one to notice that anyway. There will be other distributors who would call that out. But our dealers remain pretty robustly optimistic on overall the life of equipment where repair may not be the most economical way to move forward. So I haven't noticed anything, but we mentioned that as a call-out because that's clearly a possibility as consumer health might get worse. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just on the refrigerant transition pricing, I think you called out in the presentation greater than 10%. I think you've been saying 10% to 15%. Has anything really changed there other than maybe timing of when you get that? And then just what are you seeing from 410A refrigerant prices that might drive pricing changes this year? Alok Maskara : Sure. So if we -- on the first one, the 454 pricing, nothing has changed. Last year, we may not have been clear enough, but I think we talked a few times that we have said it will be about 15% over 2 years so that increased pricing was for '24 and '25, and we have made that statement in '23. Nothing has really changed because the fourth part of the price increase is already in process. We implemented price increases mid-Q1 and they're going to see that impact. So the remaining is 10%. So I just want to clarify that. Nothing has changed. It was just over 2 years. Now we're talking about 1 year. On 410A pricing, I think the picture is mixed. I think to be fair, the actual 410A pricing ramp-up is less than we expected, and it's almost flat. But we think that's still going to move. And from our perspective, that hasn't changed our price on the end product that we are selling this year. Operator : Next, we have a question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Ryan Merkel : Congrats on the quarter. Alok, I wanted to also ask on the A2L. Just the 50% to 60% in '25 from A2L. Just why is that the right number? And then can you clarify, is the price increase, the 10%, is that both resi and commercial? Or is commercial potentially a little bit less? Michael Quenzer : So first, I'll answer on the price increase. We think it's probably going to be both in the same ballpark of 10%, if not higher, both products need significant investments in the factory and some of the sensors in the compression technology. And then why we think it's 50% to 65%. I mean what we're seeing is that you're going to have a bit of a carryover into next year from our 410A systems that are able to be sold next year that were kind of built this year. Then you also have, within the EPA guidance, that you can sell components in the next year. So we think those 2 combined are going to be the 35% to 40% of the market next year and then the balance would be new adoption of the 454B refrigerant product. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I also wanted to ask on resi and just trends. So down 2% for volume in the first quarter, but I realize there's some destock, I think March, but the weather wasn't great. Are you just thinking resi volumes are up low single digits, is that the right cadence the rest of the way? Michael Quenzer : Yes. If you kind of look at our implied guidance, you had the balance of the year would be kind of low single digits, a little stronger on the indirect than the sell-through side, but balance kind of flat to slightly up for the rest of the year. Alok Maskara : And that's mostly for indirect. The comps get much easier starting Q2, and we are seeing the end of destocking. Operator : And next, we will hear from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So yes, maybe I'll just kind of start on just the M&A appetite question, just given there are some assets out there that could be coming to market soon just based on what's been publicly disclosed. So talk a little bit about your appetite currently and what you're looking for in potential M&A transactions going forward. Alok Maskara : Sure. I mean, we read the same articles that you guys read. I do follow JCI pretty closely, but that's mostly because my good friend, Jim Lucas, is now the Investor Relations leader there, and I like Jim a lot. But if I think from our perspective, nothing has really changed compared to when we talked about it in Q1. And just to kind of reemphasize that. We believe industry consolidation is good, especially as regulatory changes accelerate, you need more scale to be successful. From our perspective, we have been public in the past about the interest for this asset that is rumored to be on sale and that hasn't changed either. What we are very focused on is making sure re-execute appropriately, we have a very strong path ahead of us. Our 3-year plan is going to create significant value and we have kind of talked about our long-term targets. There's so much opportunity for us to become a better distributor, improve our commercial volume through the new factory, working through pricing excellence on an ongoing basis and gain share as we successfully execute through the refrigerant changes. And we have a huge big pipeline of bolt-on opportunities as well. So while we can't talk about any specific process, we have sufficient scale to compete and we feel we are in a very good position and evaluate the opportunity that they come by. Joseph Ritchie : That's super helpful, Alok. My follow-up question maybe for Michael, just going back to that seasonality comment that you made. Just curious as you kind of think of just the cadence for 2Q specifically. You guys -- it seems like destocking is coming to an end. Shouldn't the seasonality be slightly better this year because you're kind of lapping destocking comps. Just any commentary around that would be helpful. Michael Quenzer : Yes. I think there's still some uncertainty, though in the end markets on the sell-through. I think we're trying to watch weather within Q2, it's cold here in Dallas. We'll see where it goes for the rest of the quarter. So I think there's some concerns on where weather could go. But I think the 50% of the sales in the first half still seems appropriate. Alok Maskara : Yes. And we don't want to call out whether for revenue upside or downside. I'm new to the industry. And whenever I worry about whether, business leaders who have been here for a longer term, say, \"hey, just wait until next week.\" and your concerns might go away. So still early in the quarter, May and June make up a significantly bigger portion of our sales than April does. Operator : Our next question will come from Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : Thanks for all the detail thus far. I just have to ask -- so we've been hearing about the end of this destocking for a few quarters now. What's driving your confidence that this is the last time we're going to hear about this as a headwind in the quarter? Alok Maskara : Well, we've been wrong before, so we've got to keep that in mind as I answer the question. We talked about earlier, it ending by Q4. And then in Q4, we got a sense and we signaled that is likely going to continue in Q1. As we look at leading indicators, so things such as coils, we make universal coils and when we sell those, those are typically the canary in the coal mine in terms of first to go down and first to go up. So when I look at those product lines that went down first in sales, we sell them coming back up, and we had a pretty good march on those product lines and in addition conversations with our distributors. So those would be the 2 data points. But listen, we were wrong before. So maybe would be wrong again. But I think this time, we have much more data that supports it. Damian Karas : And then you guys have talked a little bit about stable, still solid orders in BCS. Could you maybe just give us a sense for what you're seeing different end markets, maybe national account versus emergency replacement, how that's kind of unpacked and how you're thinking about kind of book-to-bill going forward. Alok Maskara : Sure. If you think about our presence, remember, we don't do things like office buildings and large multistory apartment complexes. So from that perspective, our exposure to those areas, which we see were slowing last year and continue to be slow is limited, we are more in single-story building and in national accounts, whether I'd be large big boxes of any type and others. The replacement demand is what's kind of exciting, and that's what we are seeing really good momentum on as a lot of the supply constraints are behind us. Lead times are normalizing across the industry, and folks are more willing to put in the investments, especially given particularly the energy and the carbon savings they are going to get out of the new equipment. On emergency replacement, our share has dropped so low back. The market trends really don't matter to us. I mean it's all about share gain, and we are making good progress in getting back into our traditional dealers, our traditional accounts and we'll make a lot more progress in the second half of the year when our second factory gets up and running. So that's kind of behind what we talked about in terms of overall trend. Replacement, which is a vast majority of our sales, continues to be strong, and that's driving strong order rates. Operator : And our next question will come from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Just wanted to unpack a little bit more the price mix outlook for the balance of the year across segments like mathematically implied more of a dollar benefit in the resi segments. It sounds like that is primarily just the price increases, less so than mix, but would appreciate color on that as well as kind of color on the commercial side, what drives price mix for the balance of the year. Michael Quenzer : Yes. So within the quarter, we had pretty good price yield of 3%, but that was only a partial yield for some of the price increases that we announced in February and into March. So we're going to see a little bit more carryover and pick up on the pricing side. I also don't expect the new construction mix to continue like it did in Q1. So we think that, that will moderate later in the year. And then we'll also start to see some of the carryover benefit from the minimum SEER efficiency products as we get to the second half of this year, maybe late in the year, a very minor favorable mix for the 454B products not really much within the guide. But overall, it's just continued pricing within HCS. On the BCS guide, it's a similar story where we're lapping some really big price increases that we did last year. So you see a lot more of that in the first quarter that will then moderate in later quarters this year as we get some of the price increases that we announced in that segment as well. Noah Kaye : And then I really appreciate you guys taking a view on what the mix will look like on the refrigerant side next year. Just is it possible to quantify how much of a working capital headwind that is for this year because you're obviously going to have to build that inventory certainly for the direct channel before the cutoff date. Michael Quenzer : Yes. There's 2 things that we're focused on in working capital this year. It's inventory build. The first is some additional raw materials to help transition to the new building climate solutions factory in Mexico. So that's a piece of it. But then the other side of it is going to be to do a prebuild for some R-410A systems on the residential side depending on end market demand and how that's going to carry into next year. And then also on the BCS segment is that we can continue to build 410A unitary rooftops through the end of this year, and then we have 3 years to sell that through. So we want to make sure we have sufficient 410A demand to cover a few years of -- or continued volume for the next year or so on the BCS product. So that all adds up to about $50 million of inventory that we're going to have to add this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to the Building segment and really thinking about a way to dimension the new commercial capacity coming online, how does that ramp up in terms of revenue or units produced? And how should the factory utilization levels phase through the second half and then into next year? Alok Maskara : From a units produced, we have internal targets, but we haven't shared that externally. So I don't want to go there. I mean, over the long term, we did talk about that we got enough square footage to double the capacity. We think that happens over 5 years or more. So think of maybe perhaps at max 20% capacity slowly ramped up one line at a time. So I think that's kind of one way to think about it. But clearly, it will be prudent. We'll look at market conditions. And in some cases, we can obviously move in balance production between the existing factory and the new factory. So that's going to be one way to look at it. But we haven't put in machines in the ground to double the full capacity. We've got enough space to do that, but we'll put those investments as the demand materializes. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. Makes sense. And then just wanted to come back to the forecast on the composition of the new refrigerant products next year. I guess as the old refrigerant supply is reduced, is it reasonable to think the pricing on the legacy units also needs to step up again next year as you're dealing with less supply? Michael Quenzer : Yes. As we always do, we'll come out with a new price increase next year on the 410A system and depending where the cost of that gas goes up, which we expect to go up significantly. It could also have a pretty large increase similar to the 454B product. But we're monitoring that, and there will be another price increase on that next year for the 35% of the demand. Alok Maskara : And also keep in mind there will be manufacturing inefficiencies associated with manufacturing the older 410A units because the volume is going to go down and the factory has got to be more complex at higher cost for the 410A that we expect. Operator : Next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : And thanks for the effort to improve earnings quality. I think most companies are hellbent ongoing in the other direction. Maybe my first question would be around -- the commentary around the sort of second quarter and the first half and so forth. So you've got about $1.5 billion sales, I suppose, or thereabout starting for Q2 based on that 50-50 first half split. When we're thinking about sort of margin profile. Classically, you've had sort of 35%, 40% sequential operating leverage in the second quarter just with the fixed cost absorption and so forth. I just wondered if that figure would be any different this year, whether because of the Mexico plant ramp-up or the phasing of, say, those A2L headwinds of 5 million to 10 million that you call out? Maybe just any sort of color around how those items play out from here and the sort of second quarter sequential leverage. Michael Quenzer : Yes, there will be some additional investments they're going to start to make in the second quarter that weren't fully impacted in the first quarter predominantly launching the new commercial factory as well as starting to transition to the new 454B product in HCS. Additionally, we had a bit of a onetime benefit within Q1 for margins for warranty adjustments, so that will also kind of not repeat in the next year or the next quarter. But overall, there will be some cost increases coming into the second and third quarters that weren't within the first quarter. Julian Mitchell : Got it. Okay. So still sort of decent leverage, but maybe with some offsets this year specifically. Michael Quenzer : Correct. Yes, some ramp-up costs that we're going to need to transition to get the product ready. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question, circling back to the BCS division. Certainly, the tone, I think, from Alok seems a little bit more cautious on that new construction aspect and project delays, and we see that more broadly in things like the ABI readings. Maybe to sort of -- if you could put a finer point, Alok, the project delays aspect, is that just an expectation of what could happen later in the year? Maybe any updated thoughts on the education vertical? Is that asset tailwind sort of starts to expire. And I guess the thrust of the question is really, you had 21% revenue growth in that BCS segment in the first quarter, the year is up 10%, is an implied decline at some point just pure conservatism? Or is there anything we're really seeing on those project delays or education vertical or something like that? Alok Maskara : Sure. I guess, Julian, the 2 biggest factors on that is we like to be conservative, and second we had fairly easy comps in Q1 compared to where we were last year. On the demand side, I'll start by saying we remain manufacturing or production capacity constrained, not demand constrained. So keep that in mind as I answer all the other different points in here. The new construction and the project push to the right is actually happening right now that only impacts 15% to 20% of our sales that was about -- 75%, 80% of that is, our sales are all replacement, but we needed to call that out just because it does impact a portion of our sales. But today, it's not an issue because again, being supply constrained versus demand constraint continues to hold for us. Education vertical, yes, it had some benefits last year, may have left this year, but it's really not a material mover for us nor was it last year. So it really doesn't impact us. The biggest driver of optimism there is the age of units, the units on the rooftop, whether it's a big box and others, they are way beyond the useful life. Many of them are like 18 years where the useful life is closer to 14 to 16. That's what drives our optimism about order rates and things going forward. But the delta that you officially asked for at the beginning is easier comps and some conservatism built in because no factory startup goes perfectly, Julian. As you know, factory startups always have some issues here or there. So we just didn't want to get ahead of ourselves. Operator : Our next question will come from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: First question is just related to pricing strategy, and I think both on HCS and BCS, you had sort of engaged with consultants and have implemented pricing changes as a result. The question is just related to what inning you're in, in that, the degree to which that's complete, the degree to which we see it in the P&L. And as a result, was it a matter of you were pricing below market on a net pricing side of things and maybe you're above market? Just overall, kind of the outcome of those efforts, sort of where you are pricing relative to what you see pricing in the market being? Alok Maskara : If you just click it, I would tell you in the first inning, but since it's baseball, I have to say we are probably the third or fourth inning of that right now. Where we are is, yes, we were below market price in many of our key accounts where we have signed contracts after the tornado and pre-COVID and we did not have inflation clauses in that. So there was definitely a large portion of our sales where we were and in some cases, still below market their process to get up to the market level. So I think that's a big part of that. There is a second part of that, which is around giving the local leaders autonomy to an extent to get pricing adjusted, we used to do national pricing and then we realized there is no such thing as national pricing. Pricing in South is very different than pricing in the North. So we will be able to capture greater pricing excellence just by having more localized pricing and there's going to be upside on that working through that. The third aspect of pricing is simply around us continuing to capture pricing ahead of inflation because people think inflation has gone away, and it's not. So as we do price increases and the fact that we lost margin points during the COVID transition and during the tornado, we need to just work with all our channel partners and customers and make sure we get price ahead of inflation, not behind inflation because inflation continues to impact us, whether it's SG&A or materials or labor, all of that impacts SG&A. So those are the 3 aspects, I would say we are less than halfway complete, but pleased with progress so far, and especially pleased with some of the price actions we took on key accounts and gotten closer to market, but still below market in some cases. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then also just wanted to ask on leverage and when you think about the M&A opportunity set out there, you talked about a long-term target leverage range in the 1x to 1.5x. But if the right opportunity were to present itself, how high are you comfortable taking leverage to pursue that type of opportunity? Michael Quenzer : If the right opportunity materialize, we'd go up kind of 3%, maybe a little over 3% near term and then quickly want to get back to that 1 to 1.5x after that initial increase to above 3%. But the key is maintaining investment grade ratings. That's the key. Operator : Our next question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : And I appreciate Alok that you're not going to use any cricket analogies because I would have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, on the manufacturing line conversion, just give us a sense, is this the clarify, is that the $5 million to $10 million that is in the assumption? And is this in the Mexico facility? And just give us a sense of how disruptive is this to the actual line to change over to the new refrigerants? Are you adding some new components? Is there new testing? Is it a higher pressurization, just what -- from a technology standpoint, logistics standpoint, how disruptive might that be? Alok Maskara : Sure. So the two inefficiencies we called out. One is the Saltillo Mexico start-up inefficiencies. And then we called out $5 million to $10 million of additional inefficiencies on residential for transitioning from 410A to 454B. The change is pretty big. We have to make sure that we are handling appropriately the new refrigerant, which is mildly flammable. So it has a different classification when it comes to DOT regulations, so it requires different piping, different storage, different testing, different test chambers. Though the compressors are new, the size of the product might change in some cases. So it's a fairly big change, but we're pretty used to it. We are very ready. This is not starting now. A lot of these changes started last year. So for example, the new refrigerants line already been in start and the new storage tanks already in the facility. We're already doing test runs. If we needed to make products today, we would. So the inefficiency costs that we called out would simply be lines shutting down for a few weeks while we make all the changes, test the product and then restart it. That's kind of the core source of inefficiencies. Most of the investments are already kind of on the floor now. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then the follow-up question for Michael, and I'll also add my shout out for the quality of earnings. I mean, we had to spend some time this morning to doublecheck that we weren't missing something. There were no eliminations, and that was the conclusion. I said, \"Oh my gosh, this is as close to gap as any company we follow.\" So thank you. Alok Maskara : Chelsey and I were listening to you, Deane, when you told us that at your conference, and we took that as a challenge. So it did start at your conference when you mentioned that to Chelsey and I. Deane Dray : All right. I appreciate that. And then so that's -- with all this buildup, I've got more of a mundane question on free cash flow. We know first quarter is typically a use, but it was less of a use. What are the dynamics there? And you said you've got some additional inventory build coming, where does buffer inventory as we distance ourselves from all the supply chain issues? Have you read yourself a buffer inventory entirely? Is that still winding down, but some color there would be helpful. Michael Quenzer : Yes. On the raw material side, yes, our inventories are still higher than we like. They are drifting down better as supply chains are healing. So they are coming down, but we're going to have to grow them a bit for this Building Climate Solutions transition to ramp up that new factory. But overall raw inventory is getting better. But yes, we will -- we're going to start to grow inventory later this year for the new 410A product and we're going to start to rebuild and grow some of that in the second half of this year. And then another element that we have within the free cash flow guide is that the CapEx is also going to be a little bit higher in the second half of this year than our normal guide. Normally, we have about $110 million of CapEx. It's about $175 million. You can see that there's going to be more in the second half to complete the ramp-up of the factory and get our transition to the new 454B product ready to go. Operator : Our next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : I guess first thing is just on the commercial margins, obviously, really, really strong again this quarter. Thinking through all the puts and takes through the rest of the year and how the comp gets a lot harder through from 2Q to 4Q, I guess how much conviction do you guys have that you can continue to expand margins year-on-year through the rest of the year? Michael Quenzer : Yes. So we continue to do pricing excellence. And we've announced up to 8% price increase in Q1. So we're going to continue to drive price increase, even though it's going to lap some of the comps, which are going to be a little more challenging. Right now, our guide is volumes kind of flattish to up low single digits in the balance of the year. That normally comes with 30% incremental. So that should help drive our return on sales, operating profit margins up higher. But then working against that as a little bit of the headwinds that we have to ramp that new factory up. So absent of the factory ramp, we still see margins modestly moving up. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then we've seen copper and aluminum costs rising recently. Can you just refresh us on when that could potentially impact your P&L? Would that be more of like a 2025 concern at this point or something to focus on. Michael Quenzer : Yes. So we see steel increases that are also starting to come up. That's more immediate. That kind of is on a quarterly lag. The copper and aluminum goes through a hedging process. It's kind of an 18-month blended hedging process. So we'll start to see some of that this year, but it will come into next year as well. We'll continue to monitor that. If it stays elevated, we'll have to see what type of pricing actions later this year we need to do. But definitely, that would be reflective in the new 454B product, if it continues on pricing and the [Indiscernible] pricing into next year. Operator : And our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you just help me reconcile some of the price and mix dynamics. I mean you guys had put through, I believe, Allied was in January 1 and then the rest of the business maybe in early February. I think they were upwards of like 10% price increases. Price was up 3% in the quarter. So maybe just help me reconcile that? And then what basically gets that to accelerate through the rest of the year. I mean, your price mix was basically 1% for the quarter with negative mix. So maybe just help me reconcile those data points with kind of the mid-single-digit guidance? Michael Quenzer : Specifically speak to the pricing. So within the quarter, we only had a partial quarter on the price increase. So we announced on the Lennox brand starting February. So that didn't even fully get all the way through February, seeing about a month on the Lennox side. So that should continue to increase as we go throughout the year on just the normal flow activity on Lennox. And then we also had price increases on some of our large PE and builder contracts that also was -- some of those were also a partial quarter. So you'll start to see that also expand later in the year. On the mix side, we don't think that the new construction mix is going to continue, so that should help going forward. But we're watching it to see if it does. But right now, we're assuming that, that mix basically slows down on the RNC side. C. Stephen Tusa : So that mix number that you put in there, the mix for sales is a mix driven by type of business like new construction versus like replace. That's what that negative 2% mix reflects? Michael Quenzer : Within the quarter, correct, yes. C. Stephen Tusa : I didn't -- have you guys always accounted for it that way? I thought that was more about like the SEER level of the product as opposed to the type of customer you're selling to? Michael Quenzer : Well, if you think within that customer, it is a SEER level of the product that normally do entry-level type products. So it's kind of a mix of both. Alok Maskara : Steve, we wanted to do it the same way. Last year, we called out the SEER-1 because that was the largest driver as we're going from older SEER standards to the newer one. But for us, mix has always been product types and RMC products are part of that mix change. C. Stephen Tusa : Right. I guess, but that's not really going to change, I guess, over the next several quarters, right? Mix should remain relatively new construction focused? Or does that mix change over the next several quarters? Alok Maskara : Well, as new housing starts had gone down, I think Q1 last year was abnormally low. So I think both start impacting, right? We're comping ourselves out of the dip that we had last year. C. Stephen Tusa : Got it. And then just one last one on commercial. What do you think the market did this quarter? I mean, the AHRI data, which is obviously a little more narrow than what some people define as a light commercial market. That looked pretty strong. you guys had volume that was up, I think, mid- to high single digits. What do you think the market did? And did you guys -- I guess, how do you perform relative to that in your estimation? Michael Quenzer : Our  AHRI reported rooftop units were up more than that 7%. We had some declines in our refrigeration volume within the quarter that were taking down some of the gains, but we think we grew faster than the AHRI on rooftops within the quarter, winning back some share. Alok Maskara : Yes. And you can take our entire segment and compare it. Michael is saying only a portion of our segment gets compared to that. So we did equal or better than the AHRI data. Operator : Next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple of questions. First, was wondering in April, you talked about destocking in the third-party channel coming to an end. Can you talk about maybe April order trends in that channel and how that might inform your conviction? Alok Maskara : Yes. Given that we are having the call towards the end of April, conviction is already reflective of what we are seeing in April. So we remain convinced that the destocking is coming to an end. Gautam Khanna : Do you anticipate that channel will be down in the second quarter still in terms of unit volumes? Alok Maskara : No. I would expect that channel to be up in unit volume in Q2. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And that's irrespective -- I mean, assuming weather is not a big variable year-to-year. Alok Maskara : Yes. I'm going to call out weather, but listen, I don't want to get nervous just because I have to wear a sweatshirt in Texas in April. Gautam Khanna : Got you. Okay. I was wondering if you could talk about the demand you think you'll have as the new Mexican capacity comes online. So maybe if you could talk about customers or business that you may not have been able to accommodate on the commercial side. So because obviously, people get concerned about commercial unitary demand starting to soften after a big run up of COVID. What gives you conviction that you'll be able to fulfill that capacity over time? Alok Maskara : Yes. So listen, great question. While there are no certainties. Here's what we know and we look at, right? I mean, our order rates continue to be higher than what we can manufacture, and we are still turning away businesses that we would rather not. So that's just internal way we are looking at, and that's been going out for 2 to 3 years now. So could [Indiscernible] tomorrow it might, but that's one. Second, we have made significant investments in preparing our sales team to go out and start adding -- in some cases, adding back contractors whom we had lost and working towards emergency replacement. And that's part of some of the investments that we talked about is leveraging our core contractors or Lennox dealers to be able to push that emergency replacement market. And finally, it's the key accounts and the conversations that we're having with them especially when it comes to 454B products because some of them had delayed replacement and want to do replacement with 454B products because they know that, that refrigerants will be around longer and will be lower global warming potential rated. So they get some carbon credits for that as well. So multiple factors in there goes down to our current rate investments we have made in drumming up extra demand, and lots and lots of conversations with our key accounts to pull that forward. But at the same time, I mean, current factory is running kind of overcapacity. So in case the demand fully doesn't come through, we've got lots of flexibility in where we produce and what we produce. And that flexibility is also super exciting to us and baked into our numbers going forward. Gautam Khanna : That's helpful. And last one for me. On the JCI assets for sale, you guys have expressed an interest in the York resi unitary stuff. If it were -- if there were other assets embedded in whatever they're selling, is that something you guys would entertain? Or is that too much complexity for what you ultimately want and therefore not worth pursuing? I'm just curious how that -- because we hear that then we sell more of it, pull it once, then you got to divest it or whatever. Alok Maskara : Yes, sure. No, that's fair. Again, I don't want to comment on other company, but I'll tell you we are going to be focused on HVAC. I mean we are an  HVACR  company, and that's what we do, focused on that. And I don't think that's going to change just because opportunistically something else becomes available. And our strategy is working. We have the scale. We see a strong pathway ahead for us just doing execution on our [Indiscernible] business end. But we'll remain very focused. Gautam Khanna : And that's North American HVAC, just to be clear, correct? Alok Maskara : No, I would say we are looking at North American HVAC as being the primary market. We do a lot of exports as well. And the heat pump technology that we use, we do get from overseas. As you know, we already have hundreds of millions of sales in that. Operator : And thank you for joining us today. With no further questions, this will conclude the Lennox's 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

All lines are currently in a listen-only mode and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead. Chelsey Pulcheon : Thank you, Madison. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We are excited to share our 2024 second quarter results. Joining me is CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2. A reminder that during today\u2019s call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today\u2019s presentation and the webcast archive link for today\u2019s call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara. Alok Maskara : Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased to share that Lennox delivered outstanding Q2 financial results and has also made significant progress on multiple strategic initiatives. I\u2019m proud to highlight that we have now achieved six consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth. This demonstrates the power of our transformation plan and management\u2019s ability to consistently execute our growth acceleration initiatives. Turning our attention to Slide 3. Let\u2019s review some of the achievements of this quarter. Lennox\u2019s core revenue grew 8%, and our adjusted segment margin expanded 100 basis points to record 21.9%, resulting in an adjusted earnings per share increase of 11% to $6.83. We generated $184 million of operating cash flow and our industry-leading ROIC grew to 44%. Home Comfort Solutions delivered record segment margins of 23.3%, a 170 basis point expansion over prior year as we started experiencing the end of destocking in our two-step distribution business. Our Building Climate Solutions segment continued its track record of profit growth. In addition, we manufactured our first units at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. As we continue to ramp up this factory, we know that there will be second half inefficiencies, but we are excited about the addition of growth capacity to better meet customer demand by year-end. One of our key accomplishments this quarter was the establishment of a joint venture with Samsung. This joint venture will open up exciting opportunities for both companies by combining Samsung\u2019s global reach and brand strength with our direct-to-dealer distribution network. This collaboration is expected to significantly enhance our heat pump market share. Strong first half results give us the confidence to increase our full year EPS guidance, raising it to a range of $19.50 to $20.25. Our focus on executing our transformation plan continues to pay off. But before moving on, I want to express my gratitude to our dedicated employees and loyal customers who have made this success possible. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our recent joint venture with Samsung. I\u2019m excited to provide more insights on the Samsung-Lennox HVAC North America joint venture. Our collaboration is all about accelerating heat pump growth both for ducted and ductless products. Let\u2019s start with what makes this partnership a winning combination. Lennox and Samsung are mutually exclusive ductless HVAC partners in North America, combining our strengths to create a comprehensive and integrated portfolio that will benefit our customers. This integration allows us to leverage our direct channel strength with Samsung\u2019s global brand and technology, providing unparalleled value and service to our dealers. Heat pumps currently make up about 30% of the market and through our joint venture we can extend our reach within this fast-growing category. Our joint offerings include attractive ductless solutions, and we are particularly excited about our colder climate heat pumps, which are designed to deliver better performance in the Northern U.S. regions. Another key advantage of our joint venture is the enhanced technology it will provide our customers. Samsung\u2019s SmartThings controls and home automation platform are at the forefront of innovation providing seamless integration and superior energy monitoring for homeowners. Both companies are committed to North American specific new product development ensuring our offerings meet the highest quality standards and deliver superior comfort to our consumers. In the future, we expect to provide our dealers with combined ducted and ductless offerings in addition to more hybrid heat pump systems. This joint venture is set to accelerate heat pump growth for us through an industry-leading portfolio with advanced technology and strong brands. Ultimately, this partnership between Lennox, a North American Champion, and Samsung, a global champion, is poised to be a winning combination. We are looking forward to driving growth and innovation together. Now let me hand the call to Michael, who will take us through the details of our Q2 financial performance. Michael Quenzer : Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. As Alok mentioned at the start of this call, we are pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit earnings per share growth. In addition to delivering double-digit profit growth, we have achieved year-over-year ROS expansion in each of those quarters. The strong second quarter financial performance underscores the effectiveness of our strategies and the dedication of our team. Now I will share more details on the second quarter financial results. Core revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8%, driven by sales volumes improvements, continued pricing excellence and benefits from the AES acquisition. Adjusted segment profit increased $38 million, or 13%. This improvement is largely due to $44 million of price and mix benefits and $19 million of organic and inorganic sales volume. These profit gains were partially offset by wage inflation, new factory ramp-up costs and investments in both SG&A distribution. Total adjusted segment margin was a record 21.9%, up approximately 100 basis points versus prior year. Our second quarter tax rate was 19.9% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.6 million in the prior year quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 and review the financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 5% revenue growth, 13% segment profit growth and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. The 5% sales growth was primarily driven by our continued pricing excellence, which delivered 4% price yield in the quarter. In the second quarter, we achieved a volume growth of 1% driven by mid-single-digit increases in our 2-step distribution channel as industry destocking concluded midway through the quarter. Sales volumes through our direct-to-contractor business were flat to the prior year. We also experienced a $19 million year-over-year increase in expenses, driven by wage and general inflation as well as critical investments in distribution and sales to further our goal of improving the customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Business Climate Solutions segment also continues to deliver strong revenue growth, up 15% this quarter. 6% of this revenue growth is attributed to the AES acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We are very pleased with the integration progress of this new business and the substantial synergies we have already realized. In addition to inorganic growth, we achieved a notable 9% organic volume growth driven by gradual production improvements at our existing Stuttgart factory. While these improvements are positive, total production output still limits our ability to fully meet demand. We are encouraged by the progress of our new commercial factory, which remains on track, and we successfully built our first few units in early July. Profit for the segment increased $11 million, although this was moderated by approximately $5 million in ramp-up costs for our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico. Please turn to Slide 8 where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow generated in the quarter was $184 million compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the quarter, a decrease of $17 million compared to the prior year. In the second half, we anticipate temporary increases in working capital as we ramp up our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico and prepare for the transition to the new low GWP product. The team also remains focused on accounts payable and accounts receivable process improvements to drive efficiencies. These factors are all included in our full year free cash flow guidance and long-term cash conversion targets. Maintaining our industry-leading ROIC is an important part of our investment strategy, additional factory capacity, enhancements to our distribution network and smooth regulatory transitions enable us to consistently deliver results and improve our competitiveness in the market. In addition, we\u2019re continually evaluating M&A opportunities that fit our strategic objectives positioning us for sustained growth market leadership. We have a very strong balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 1.2x, down from 1.8x in the prior year. Our strategy for capital deployment remains focused on prioritizing high-return capital expenditure investments, increasing dividends annually and share repurchases dependent on M&A activity. We are also dedicated to maintaining our investment grade rating. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 full year guidance. After the second quarter results and more visibility into the second half of the year, we have refined our full year revenue guidance for each segment. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company revenue is still projected to increase by approximately 7%. We now expect low single-digit improvement in sales volumes, which reflects increases for both segments. Price and mix expectations remained relatively unchanged within the range of mid-single-digit revenue growth. As a result of our strong first half profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $19.50 to $20.25 from the previously guided $19 to $20. We\u2019re also maintaining our free cash flow guidance at $500 million to $600 million. Component cost inflation is now expected to be up low single digits compared to mid-single digits in our previous guide. We still anticipate year-over-year increases in R-410A refrigerant and commodity inflation. We anticipate ramp-up costs of approximately $10 million for the new Saltillo, Mexico factory along with approximately $10 million associated with refrigerant transition across both segments\u2019 manufacturing facilities. SG&A expenses are expected to increase in the year as a result of both inflationary pressures and investments. Our investments are focused on resources to improve customer experience and distribution growth initiatives. We will also be making investments in both sales and marketing to support our long-term growth targets. Capital expenditures are expected to remain unchanged at $175 million. Interest expense is still expected to be approximately $50 million. And tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Overall, our performance in the first half of the year, combined with increased clarity on market risks, has given us the confidence to raise and narrow our EPS guide range. With that, please turn to Slide 10. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of end markets. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Michael. Let me provide updates on our outlook and share opportunities for both our segments. Within our Home Comfort Solutions segment, historically, Consumer Health has been a significant driver of the repair versus replace decision. Therefore, we are diligently monitoring macroeconomic factors, but have only seen minor shifts toward repairs. Encouragingly, industry inventory levels have largely returned to normal and recent updates on EPA ruling have provided greater clarity to the upcoming refrigerant transition. In the Home Comfort Solutions segment, the greater share opportunities will result from successfully executing the upcoming refrigerant transition, improving overall fulfillment rates and enhancing go-to-market capabilities. Within the Building Climate Solutions end market, we continue to watch for any indication of short-term disruptions due to the refrigerant transitions. However, order rates and backlog continue to be stable and feedback from our customers suggest that there is a strong pent-up demand for rooftop replacements. While we have seen project delays in some verticals, we are encouraged by the customer interest in our new cradle to grave services enabled by the recent AES acquisition. We remain excited about the opportunity to gain share in the emergency replacement market, leveraging our upcoming production capacity at Saltillo. The new production capacity at Saltillo will also free up capacity at our Stuttgart plant to target additional key accounts. Overall, our outlook for the year remains cautiously optimistic. Based on Lennox\u2019s history of successful regulatory transitions, we expect to benefit from new product mix and potential market share growth. Now please turn to Slide 11. As we conclude today\u2019s earnings call, I want to reaffirm our confidence in our ability to consistently deliver growth results by focusing on the five elements of our strategic transformation plan. First, we will continue to accelerate growth by improving our go-to-market effectiveness. Second, we will expand resilient margins through pricing excellence, increased productivity and by leveraging our direct-to-dealer network. Third, by leveraging the Lennox unified management system, we will streamline processes, leverage best practices, and consistently execute our strategy. Fourth, our continued technological advancement will enable Lennox to remain at the forefront of innovation for our customers. Finally, our core values and guiding behaviors are the foundation of our winning culture, supported by our pay-for-performance incentive structure. This comprehensive strategy not only supports our brand performance, but also reinforces our commitment to delivering long-term goals. I am immensely proud of our achievements, and I firmly believe that our greater successes are still ahead of us. Thank you for listening. We will be happy to take questions now. Madison, let\u2019s go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Ryan Merkel : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the price mix contribution at up 3% versus the mid-single-digit guide. Are you expecting price mix to improve in the second half? Michael Quenzer : Hey Ryan, this is Michael. No, actually, what we\u2019re expecting is the second half of the year to be similar to the first half. So I think we were kind of low-single digits in the first half, I think we\u2019re applying slightly mid-single digits in the second half. If you recall in the first quarter, we had some unfavorable mix, mostly because of residential new construction in the HCS business. But overall, price mix should continue on similar to what we saw in Q2. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. And then I had a question on the outlook. Just to clarify, residential, you lowered it to up 5, I think, it was up 6 last quarter, but you raised the volume to low single digits from flat. Can you just unpack that a little bit and talk about what you are expecting in the second half? Michael Quenzer : Yes. That\u2019s just cleaning up some of the guide points based off the year-to-date mix that we\u2019ve seen in both Q1 and Q2. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. So nothing has really changed with the resi outlook. You mentioned minor shift to repair, but not a lot has changed. Michael Quenzer : Nope. Not a lot. We just cleaned up with the guide points. Ryan Merkel : All right, thanks, I am passing on. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Damian Karas with UBS. Damian Karas : Hey good morning everyone. Michael Quenzer : Good morning. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Damian. Damian Karas : Congrats on the JV. Alok, maybe I just wanted to ask you about that, how are you thinking about the financial impact of the JV? You talked a little bit about it\u2019s really focused on heat pump and our opportunity to gain the market share, how much of an uplift to your organic growth profile for the residential Home Comfort Business? Do you think that represents? And any other kind of margin or cash flow impact to the JV we should be thinking about? Alok Maskara : Sure. Yes, thanks. So, let me start by saying it\u2019s going to impact both the Home Comfort Solutions and also the Building Climate Solutions because, obviously, we bring many splits mostly for HCS, and we bring VRF products mostly for BCS on both sides. As we looked at our long-term goals, we have always talked about that heat pump penetration is a pending opportunity for Lennox. And this essentially closes the gap between our portfolio and what the market leading portfolios were. The cash flow margins on that from a JV contribution, it\u2019s not going to be meaningful. What\u2019s going to be meaningful is the margins we make on selling the products, the share we gain by expanding our heat pump portfolio and the increased benefit of having a strong partner like Samsung as we develop new technology, whether it\u2019s core climate, heat pump technology, or just simply look at controls such as smart things and total integration for a home or building control. But the JV itself, the way we look at it is the financials are not going to be material to our bottom line numbers, but it\u2019s going to be the results of partnering and selling those products that we are super excited about. We went through a long process. We\u2019ve been exploring for this for about two years, spoke to several different potential partners, and we do believe Samsung is kind of the best partner for us given that we have \u2013 we can consider ourselves as the North American champion and they consider themselves and are a global champion. So putting that together, we are excited about the combination. Damian Karas : Makes sense, thanks for that. And I want to ask you about Home Comfort. I think investors were getting pretty bullish just experiencing some of the hot temperatures thus far this summer, so it feels like kind of your resi volumes are a little bit more stable. You did raise the expectations for the year to low single digits. Could you just maybe talk about kind of how your orders, trends have been progressing through the second quarter and kind of how July has been playing out so far? Alok Maskara : Sure. So one of the things we \u2013 Michael and try I really, really hard is not to talk about weather in an earnings conference call. And I think there\u2019s a \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen any upside to talk about whether in the earnings conference call, but it does have an impact. But listen, the year is progressing along as we expected is a simple way to look at it. Yes, there was some price mix cleanup that we did based on results year-to-date. But overall, the volumes are as we expected. Last year, we talked about destocking ending in the first half. It ended in Q2. We had wished it ended in Q1. We think consumer demand is very stable, and that\u2019s reflected in our volume guide for the year and our first half performance. So nothing really has changed. What\u2019s exciting there is the upcoming 454B refrigerant, that the EPA rules and the clarification on EPA rules has just given us more confidence going forward on what it could be. But at the same time, there are quite a few uncertainties that remains in the second half. And those are around 454 transitions, how competition will do around that, will there be a large pre-buy or not, election years could be weird for consumer behavior, so we are watching out for all of that. So we built all of that uncertainty into our second half guide and try to reflect that. Damian Karas : Great, thanks for your thought. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Tommy Moll : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Alok Maskara : Good morning. Michael Quenzer : Good morning, Tommy. Tommy Moll : First question for you on the Home Comfort Solutions volume, so the outlook for the year went from flat to up low singles. Can you just tell us what your underlying assumptions are there for two-step versus direct? And then on the two-step side, any context you can provide as to how the destocking ended through Q2, even if just anecdotal would be of interest. Thank you. Michael Quenzer : Sure, Tom. Yes, on the full year guide, what we\u2019re expecting on the sell-through of the direct side is approximately flat for the full year and down the two step up mid-single digits. So that kind of blends to up low single-digit increase. As you recall, when we went into the year, we expected the direct side through our Lennox channel to be down low single digits, that\u2019s performing a little bit better. And then the destocking, as we mentioned, yes, it definitely accelerated as we went through the quarter, and June was better than the beginning of the quarter. So pleased to see the destocking ending. Tommy Moll : Thanks Michael. As a follow-up, I wanted to hit on the reference to product mix and inflation. Alok, this was on your 2024 slide. I\u2019m just talking to the drivers of some of the end markets. And I\u2019m just curious what was behind that comment. And maybe more importantly, Alok, do you continue to view ten plus percent as a cumulative realization on the A2L product? Thanks. Alok Maskara : Yes. Let me start with the 10%, yes, the answer is simple, and it\u2019s yes. We continue to expect ten-plus percentage pricing benefit on that. I think there\u2019s any change in the product mix that we talked about and Michael referenced earlier, were minor. It was more driven by the fact that we do see consumers continue to demand 410 products and we don\u2019t see the industry or ourselves having a significant share of 454B sales this year. If we had talked about in Q1, we\u2019re just kind of reconfirming that 454B is going to be about 10% plus pricing increase. We think majority of this year\u2019s sales are going to continue to be 410A even more than we thought previously. And we remain very bullish about 454B next year as a step change in the industry\u2019s profile around margin expectations and a step change in technology. And we are also very confident that we are in a strong, strong position to execute well and give up dealers exactly what they want, which is they want 410 products as long as possible, and then they want to switch to 454B as seamlessly as possible. Tommy Moll : Thank you, Alok. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, speaking of election uncertainty, can you just level set us on what your \u2013 how much of your sales contribution is coming out of your Mexico facilities at this point? I think we had it sort of in the mid-20s when we did this fire drill in 2018 and 2019? Any update there would be helpful. Thank you. Alok Maskara : So sure. On the BCS side, we\u2019re just starting the Mexico facility, so it\u2019s close to zero on that one right now. On the HCS side, our low-end products are mostly made in Mexico. Overall, I would say it\u2019s about half of our products come from Mexico. And we have obviously all the standard protections around making sure we have the Maquiladora structure and all that set up. We\u2019ll see where the election goes. I mean, I think we are in a very strong position. We are taking steps to just like starting two years ago to reduce our reliance and sourcing more products locally and we continue to do that. But we do have half of our production coming from Mexico, which gives us substantial advantages even when we buy components and bring them from overseas into Mexico. Michael Quenzer : And I\u2019ll just add, our competition also manufacturers in Mexico is very similar to us. Jeff Sprague : Great. Understood. And then, Michael, just on free cash flow, it\u2019s kind of a modest weak, right? But estimate \u2013 net income is going up, free cash flow isn\u2019t, it already wasn\u2019t a particularly strong free cash flow conversion year. Just kind of what\u2019s going on there? And maybe we know CapEx is probably going down in 2025, which will help on the conversion, but maybe just a little bit of additional color on what to expect \u2013 how things play out the remainder of the year and into the first part of next year? Michael Quenzer : Yes, I think some of that is just around flexibility. We want to work with the markets and our customers as this 410A transition occurs to the 454B and the ramp-up of the new factory to make sure we have sufficient raw materials and inventory there. So really, it\u2019s just more uncertainty in the second half of some of our inventory levels, but we\u2019re focused on driving that cash flow perspective. But then as we get into next year, we\u2019ve set targets at near 90% cash flow conversion. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on right now. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning. So Alok, I know would have a live just installed a bunch of Samsung heat pumps and they\u2019re great. So congratulations on that JV. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve got a slice of that, by the way. It might have been before the JV was formed, but it\u2019s worked really well. So just talking about the sell-through down mid-single full year direct business, June had two few selling days. So I know you don\u2019t like to talk about the weather, but maybe just address what impact those two few selling days\u2019 motor pads [ph] on the Home Comfort performance this quarter. Alok Maskara : Sure. So I think Home Comfort on the direct side, Q2 was flat to last year, and we are guiding the full year also to be flat. Our original guide was to say we would be down low single digits on a direct-to-dealer method. So implied guide is higher for us in terms of in a direct side. On the 2-step, we expect second half to be pretty strong. But as you can imagine, the destocking went on a little longer than we all had expected. That\u2019s kind of the only change that has happened in our outlook for HCS is midway through the year. As Michael said, we updated a bunch of our guide points. But the reality, the only change has been that we destocking lasted a little longer, but now we are confident is over our direct is doing a little better than we expected to be essentially flat compared to last year. And we think 454B is going to be on track and it\u2019s going to be launched and sold mostly in 2025. But there\u2019s no really change to our outlook beyond that. Nigel Coe : Yes. But the June impact, did that have an impact in the quarter? Alok Maskara : Sorry, which impact? Nigel Coe : The selling days, the two few selling days, did that have an impact? Alok Maskara : No. I think from a 2Q, we didn\u2019t see any specific impact of that, no. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. And then just digging into the commercial \u2013 the building control segments. Price mix, I think, was pretty flat this quarter. That\u2019s obviously been very strong. I know you got tougher comps as we sort of lap that impact. But anything to call out there? I know you\u2019re still calling for a mid-single-digit impact on price mix. So just wondering if there\u2019s anything intra-quarter that we should think about? Michael Quenzer : Yes. We have some normal transitory mix within that segment. As you recall, we have HVAC equipment. We have services and we have refrigeration business. We did see a little bit of unfavorable mix, mostly in the service and refrigeration business, but nothing to be concerned about just kind of transitory normal mix. We expect that to continue kind of mid-single digits for the balance of the year in that segment. Nigel Coe : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with the BCS segment. So the top-line outlook, you talked about sort of solid demand, and you mentioned again these project delays that you talked about last call, but obviously, you\u2019ve taken up the volume guide for that segment for the year a little. So maybe just sort of update us, are these project delays kind of more or less than you\u2019d thought a few months ago in BCS. And any kind of updated thoughts about how we should look at the education vertical within BCS just as that as a funding starts to sort of wind down over the next couple of years. Any sort of broad brush thoughts on that? And maybe too early to throw Mexico plant impact, but anything you could give us on the top-line. Alok Maskara : Sure. On the first part of the project delays, I think it\u2019s getting better, not worse, nothing to answer your question. When we called it out in Q1, there was a lot more noise. Part of it is everybody reads some news articles and we try and interpret our own results. But our backlog remains strong, orders remain strong, and we are still heavily supply constrained, not demand constrained. On the education vertical, it\u2019s kind of fairly steady. And I know there was some IRA funding, but we ran out. But education has been a good growth engine for us. Our share has been low. We are gaining share in that vertical, and we also feel really good about all the other verticals that have not picked up yet, especially around some of the food service and retail that went through the COVID lows and now they\u2019re kind of coming back up. So from our perspective, we don\u2019t think that makes a meaningful impact either way for us going forward, because we continue to be the end supply constrained or demand constrained in our BCS business. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. And then just my follow-up would be, I suppose, I know that you and Michael, for very good reasons, don\u2019t like to get too in the weeds on sort of quarterly color and all the rest of it. But just as we\u2019re halfway through the year. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any sort of points you could give us for the balance of the year. I think often, for example, the third quarter, we get that seasonal double-digit earnings decline sequentially. I just wondered if this year might be different because of something going on with the refrigerants change coming up or the Mexican plant just starting pilot production? And just on that Mexican plant sort of related, just any sort of pointers on revenue effects over the next 12 months? Alok Maskara : Sure. So I\u2019d say on the \u2013 let me start with the Mexican plant and then I\u2019ll come back to the other part of your question. On the Mexican plant, we had inefficiencies in Q2, and we called it out. Imagine we have like 300 to 400 people fully on our payroll, a building under construction, but zero sales. So from that perspective, something similar will happen in Q3 as well. So I think that\u2019s sort of embedded and built into our numbers and guide. From a revenue perspective, we expect the bulk of the revenue to start coming through only 2025. We want to make sure these products are really good, highest quality. We are going to test them fully. We\u2019re going to field try them before we start of mass market launch. And of course, there will be revenue in Q4 as well. But I think a meaningful revenue from Mexico would be in 2025. Not much has changed in terms of seasonality. I think the historical seasonality in Q2 and Q3 used to be similar, we may have had some situations back and forth. But I think that will be a similar. What we have to watch out for, honestly, is to think about is there going to be a significant amount of pre-buy a 410A product? And if there is demand, does the manufacturers have the capacity and ability to make additional 410A product. That\u2019s sort of the uncertainty that concerns us right now. But we sort of embedded that within the range of the guidance point we gave out. But I would expect nothing unusual besides the Mexican plant inefficiency that we mentioned [Technical Difficulty] early. Julian Mitchell : Got it. So third quarter is sort of similar to Q2 and then we have that Mexican caveat this year to watch. Alok Maskara : Yes, essentially with a normal seasonality bits like last year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Thanks so much for taking the questions. On the Samsung JV, Alok, can you kind of walk us through the game plan for how this gets operationalized when the Samsung products start to become available to the dealers and in distribution and sort of the strategy around how you\u2019re marketing that? And then Michael, I believe it was already said that it\u2019s not expected to be any material contribution this year. But presumably, there\u2019s going to be good growth and equity income at some point from this you\u2019re not consolidating it. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, so this should show up as an equity income contribution. Where will that actually show up in the financials? Will that be in corporate? Will be split among the segments? Because presumably, it\u2019s going to be margin accretive once it starts coming on. Alok Maskara : Sure. Let me start on the availability. So to minimize any dealer disruptions, we are going to launch the Samsung products in the A2L range. So we will run out with our current products and keep running through that through the 410A transition and that Samsung powering the Lennox product would be launched as the new R32 product, and so you would expect it towards the end of the year. So until then for our dealers and all, it\u2019s status quo. Obviously, in the background, we are doing everything from making sure we have sufficient inventory in hand, getting the branding right, doing test marketing with the dealers, going through the technology SPACs [ph], but essentially revenue 2025 launch this year. On the second aspect of it in the JV, the equity income, again, is not going to be meaningful. The whole point of this JV is going to be around technology development and the margins we make on selling the product through our channels. Samsung will make manufacturing margin. We would make distribution margin. And it\u2019s a great way for us to test and demonstrate how we are going to be a better distributor. Now we already do this with a different vendor. So it\u2019s not new, and you\u2019re not going to see a step change anywhere. If I were to model anything, I would just model greater heat pump market share for Lennox based on this JV, because we think this gives us a very strong offering, great brand name, and it gives us dealers a great choice to fight against other market-leading companies who are currently dominating this space. Michael Quenzer : And on, I\u2019ll just add specific to where it\u2019s going to land in the P&L. We already have equity income on our P&L. So it will be on top of that. But as Alok mentioned, it\u2019s going to be minimal. The biggest gain is going to be within the segments for sales and margins. Noah Kaye : Yes. Very helpful. That plays into the second question around distribution. You called out some increased investments. You\u2019ve been very clear that you have a strategy to become a best-in-class distributor, maybe unpack some of the use of those investments you\u2019re making here and through the back half of the year. Help us understand how the strategy is progressing. Alok Maskara : Sure. The strategy is progressing really well. We are pleased with what we are saying. Some leading indicators such as fill rate have improved substantially. So like at the end, all of this investment spend is worth nothing if we don\u2019t deliver the appropriate impact to the customer and if it doesn\u2019t reflect in our share. So all of those things are running positive for us. Fill rate, customer share, customer satisfaction, all of that\u2019s doing well. The investment is around, a lot of just around warehousing, logistics, a lot is around IT systems and making sure we have the appropriate systems to keep track of our products, do the appropriate [indiscernible]. And then finally, talent. We are now getting to world-class talent level, a lot from outside, some from inside, putting it all together. And we remain committed to putting those \u2013 in some cases, we were just behind. We started this as company-owned factory outlets, and we\u2019re now becoming a distributor, and we have raised the power on ourselves. But we are really pleased with the progress as we see all the leading indicators, which bodes well for us from continued market share gain going forward in the future as well. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much as always for the caller. Looking forward to seeing the progress. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys. Good morning. So I think I\u2019m going to start with the \u2013 in the Home Comfort Solutions business, you guys called out that $19 million drag to margins. I know that you\u2019ll give a lot more color in the queue, but \u2013 maybe if you could just give us some of the kind of moving pieces, whether it\u2019s SG&A, freight and then also component costs because you have seen probably a pretty material decline in your material cost. And I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about that through the rest of the year as well. Michael Quenzer : Yes. So the component costs are actually in that product cost buckets. So we are seeing a little bit better on the component costs, mostly material cost reduction programs. The $19 million of other, think of it about half of that related to freight and distribution and a good portion of that being investments in distribution, the other half being SG&A inflation and some of the IT and investments in head count that Alok mentioned. Alok Maskara : Yes. And just as a reminder on that, if I could jump in. I mean, we have broadcast very loudly that we\u2019re investing in additional sales resources. Our Lennox residential HVAC business has 20% additional sales resources. We are redoing our incentive comps. So this has all been under works for a while, but by the end of the year, we will start lapping ourselves on this, but these are all necessary and appropriate investments with very attractive payback. Joe Ritchie : Yes. That makes sense. And I guess maybe just a longer-term question, Alok, given the Bosch announcement on the JCI assets, whenever there\u2019s any kind of changing in the hands, there\u2019s sometimes some investor angst as to what that means for the kind of discipline of the industry. I\u2019d be curious to hear if you have any just initial thoughts on whether you think this kind of changes industry dynamics or your ability to continue to kind of gain share, particularly in the residential sector. Alok Maskara : Sure. Well, on that one, I\u2019ll first start congratulating the management team at Bosch and the management team at JCI on the transaction. I\u2019m sure it was hours and hours of hard work, lost leap of multiple weekends, not that I\u2019m speaking for experience on the same transaction or anything, but I just want to congratulate them and glad that is finally sealed and signed. From our perspective, I think Bosch is a very reputable company. I think they focus on technology. They have done wonderful things by investing in R&D and they plow a lot of money back into charitable and social causes. I mean we are looking forward to Bosch joining the list of very disciplined industry players and becoming another one of them. I mean they are much better than some of the other field owners of the JCI assets and I\u2019m super excited that the industry will remain disciplined going forward and we\u2019ll compete on technology. We\u2019ll compete on differentiation. We\u2019ll compete on better service and quality. So I\u2019m super excited about where we are. Joe Ritchie : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning. Michael Quenzer : Good morning. Alok Maskara : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just \u2013 yes on the refrigerant change, I\u2019m just wondering have you guys introduced your new products and pricing into the market and gotten any feedback? And then we\u2019ve heard from a couple of other competitors that they\u2019ve kind of put out the last call for 410A which might start to indicate what level of pre-buy you might get. Just any color on those two fronts. Alok Maskara : Yes. It seems \u2013 Jeff, it seems that every competition has launched these products on social media. If you look at the nice pretty picture that we all put out. But I think from practice, you can\u2019t buy a 454B unit from anybody yet. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 we had a similar situation. Are we ready to launch it? Yes. Have we made a few trial units, yes, just like everybody else. We are on track to launch it as customer demand picks up, especially as we get into 2025. From overall last call perspective, we haven\u2019t made a last call, but we are working with our distribution partners and dealers to truly understand what their demand requirements are and tailor our manufacturing according to that. We have a very focused operation, as you know, and we want to remain flexible to give our dealers and distributors what they want. So for us, right now, our production is 410A and we\u2019ll continue producing it till the time the dealers want it until the time the law allows us to do it. Jeff Hammond : So I guess the comment on trade down is that as you\u2019re getting feedback from your distributors and dealers that are wanting more of that 410A. But anything else within kind of the trade down dynamic where consumers are trading down, whether in SEER or future? Alok Maskara : Yes. The trade down, which is a mix comment Michael was saying. First of all, any reference is mostly just rounding and small. But yes, we are expecting to sell more 410A versus more 454B. But even beginning of the year, we were expecting to sell mostly 410A throughout the year. No major dynamics on the consumer as we went from 13 to 14 SEER, obviously, there\u2019s some compression in the product line, right? Like people who are buying 16 SEERs and I\u2019m often happy with the 14, so it\u2019s a bit of a natural thing as we can sell lower SEER products, but we don\u2019t see any meaningful trade down. If I think of our sales of Merit products, Elite products and Signature got a good, better, best, those ratios are relatively the same. So I don\u2019t see major trade down on that. Jeff Hammond : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hi. Good morning all. I wanted to come back to BCS. So the factory ramp costs unchanged at $10 million for the year. What was the total impact year-to-date? And I guess as the production ramps into next year, should we think of that capacity getting absorbed in that $10 million becomes a tailwind? Or is there still some under absorption you\u2019re going to fill there? Michael Quenzer : Yes. So year-to-date, it was $7 million, so $5 million in Q2, $2 million in the first quarter. And that\u2019s exactly right. So as we fully ramp up that factory to full efficiency second half of next year, we\u2019ll start to see the efficiencies \u2013 those inefficiencies go away. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just on the pilot units in early July, so you\u2019re making the necessary factory investments. Where do you stand from a boots on the ground front-end selling standpoint as you look to reenter that emergency replacement market next year? Have you made the investments? Or is there more to go? Alok Maskara : We have made most of the investments. So at Q2 exit, the run rate would reflect most of the investments made in there. We were hiring starting kind of Q4 last year and over the past three quarters, Q4, Q1, Q2, we have made the necessary investment, and it is reflected in our Q2 exit rate. It\u2019s gone very well. I mean we\u2019re excited about the increase in our boots on the ground, we\u2019re excited about the process discipline that we are bringing along with that. We\u2019re also super excited about sort of putting our customers and dealers in a position to win again and getting them the confidence around our own availability, our lead time. And now we are in the process of setting up distribution points around the country to make sure that we can satisfy emergency replacement demand the same day in most cases and next day at the worst because that\u2019s sort of the critical portion of how you win this. So we know we\u2019re in that portion, and that\u2019s some of the distribution investment that we mentioned earlier. Brett Linzey : Appreciate the insight. Best of luck. Alok Maskara : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Steve Volkmann : Hi. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but just a couple of follow-ups. What is \u2013 how should we think about your heat pump share now in terms of trying to think about what the upside could be under the JV? Alok Maskara : Yes. I think we mentioned that heat pumps in the U.S. are around 30% of sales. We are closer to 20%, 25% of sales. So if you think about that like there\u2019s a significant delta between our sales and where the industry is. Share depends on, obviously, different players, so don\u2019t want to comment on shares, but think of that five to 10-point difference between us and the industry has an opportunity for us to win that amount and accelerate our growth. It\u2019s going to come from two things, right? One is the Samsung piece. Second is also launching on a unitary side or the ducted side, combined products are just more products on the heat pump that meet the cold climate requirement, and that\u2019s all going to happen in the first half of next year. As currently, all our innovation teams are focused on A2L, and once we take a breather out of it, we have a new lineup of heat pump ready to go on the unitary side as well. So super excited about what this brings to us and our ability to claw back and get into the industry average for heat pump share. So we are quite behind. Steve Volkmann : Perfect. Okay. Thanks. And then are you at all concerned that a change in administration might have some impact on the A2L transition either in terms of timing or amount or anything like that? Alok Maskara : No, we are not. This is kind of baked into law at this stage. And some of these changes happened when the administration was under a different political party. So I think at this stage, there\u2019s absolutely no chance of that happening. Steve Volkmann : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe O\u2019Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O\u2019Dea: Hi. Good morning. Can you just give the cadence of the refrigerant conversion cost that $10 million you called out, how we see that kind of filtering over the course of the year? Michael Quenzer : Yes. It\u2019s all going to be second half. So we haven\u2019t experienced any of that yet, and it will be kind of equal Q3 and Q4. Joe O\u2019Dea: Okay. And then Al, can you just expand a little on how you think about the ROI attached to the 20% increase in sales resources. What \u2013 and is that primarily focused on kind of emergency replacement and with the new facility coming online. So overall, kind of what your time line is? And how you\u2019re thinking about that ROI and the markets that you\u2019re going after? Alok Maskara : Sure. From an ROI perspective, I think Michael talks about this, right. I think our internal investments are the best ROI and adding these resources has a better ROI than putting in new machineries in our factories. So it\u2019s a pretty quick ROI. Most of these are two years or less payback. And most of the payback is around hiring process, getting people trained and ramp up, and they\u2019re not really very efficient for the first six to nine months, and they get pretty efficient after that. So it\u2019s good ROI. And the 20% comment, remember it applies both in our BCS and HCS. On HCS, it was about being a better distributor supporting our dealers better. And in BCS, yes, it was about focusing on emergency replacement and getting our district fully staffed up to do that, while maintaining our key accounts and investing in a key account from process and digital and separating those out in an appropriate way. So quick payback, super excited about it. What we need is production capacity and finally glad to see the SALTO factory with a roof on and with some units rolling through the conveyor belts. Joe O\u2019Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : So most of my list has been answered. I guess maybe I\u2019ll ask one, two-part question. So BCS margins, I guess, is the expectation for continued year-on-year contraction in the second half as the plant ramps up? And I think you guys had expected kind of modest expansion for the full year. So I assume that\u2019s still the outlook. And then ditto on the resi HVAC side, I think you were also looking for modest expansion in margins in that segment for the full year. Just wondering if there\u2019s been any shift in that? Thank you. Michael Quenzer : No, that\u2019s generally what\u2019s implied in our guide. Overall, if you look at our total guide, we\u2019re projecting about a 50 basis margin expansion for the enterprise. And yes, there will be some contraction in the second half, mostly because of the ramp-up costs, both to transition to the new refrigerant and the second factor BCS. But those are the kind of headwinds we see in the second half that a little bit of a margin decline. But overall, full year margins up. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks Michael. I\u2019ll pass it on. Michael Quenzer : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Just had a quick first question on the emergency replacement share opportunity. Just to make sure I understand what \u2013 where does it stand today? What has been lacking? What are you intending to do better to capture that opportunity? Alok Maskara : Sure. Thanks, Deane. I mean that\u2019s an important portion of our future growth opportunity, both from revenue and margin. So thanks for bringing it up. So pre-disruption in Stuttgart, so think of like pre-2021, 2022, we had small share in emergency replacement. That went to essentially zero during the Stuttgart disruptions. We have started selling into emergency replacement now, but we are still selling drips and drabs, not in any sustained flow basis. We look at that as a significant opportunity for us. For the full industry, emergency replacement is up to half of the revenue, depending on which player you talk about. So think of us so far being focused only on the other half and having very little or no share on the emergency replacement piece. So over the multiyear horizon, we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. Next year, we\u2019ll start making significant dent on it. And overall, our market share will still remain very low from \u2013 compared to the other large players remember, we are like third or fourth largest player in the industry. So from that perspective, I\u2019m not worried about disrupting the market because the whole industry is still running short of capacity. Deane Dray : Will that be a data point you\u2019ll be providing on a go-forward basis or just provide color? Alok Maskara : We just provide color. I don\u2019t want to get like too much into quarter-by-quarter emergency replacement share or trends versus share because it could be lumpy, not on the emergency replacement side on the key account side, where we have often big projects. And some of it becomes giving away competitive dynamics as well. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just a quick question on the colder climate heat pump technology. Is that something proprietary to Lennox, just give us some color there on what that edge is and what the efficiency is in terms of how it works in colder-climate? Alok Maskara : Sure. As you know, all colder-climate comes up using the vapor injection technology with like appropriate compressors in there. So that part itself is not proprietary because the entire industry uses the exact same technology. What\u2019s proprietary around that is the valves, the controls, the algorithm behind those controls and those are all proprietary to us. And obviously, on the mini-split VRF, those would be proprietary to Samsung. So I want to separate out the controls technology, which is proprietary versus the compressor and the vapor injection technology, which is fairly industry standard used by all of us. As everybody buys compressors on the same two or three vendors, so that\u2019s kind of where we stand. It impacts us the most because our market share in the Northern U.S. is higher than our market share in the Southern U.S. Some of the leading industry players have higher market share in the South easy warm regions and lower in the North. So for us, it just becomes a more meaningful change in penetration of heat pumps that impacts us more than others. Deane Dray : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey good morning. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Thanks for fitting me in. Just on the \u2013 first of all, just on the EPS as a follow-up to Julian\u2019s question, I think the normal seasonality is maybe down in EPS, but you said effectively flat in line with normal seasonality? Is there something that\u2019s influencing that? Or maybe seasonality is tough to nail down over the last several years. But I just wanted to get a little more precision on that seems a little bit better than normal seasonality flat sequentially? Alok Maskara : Yes. So when we\u2019re talking about flat, we were referring to inefficiencies and other things such as the ramp-up cost and other pieces, those are flat. But no, we do expect normal seasonality Steve, the flat deal reference is... Steve Tusa : Get down \u2013 down sequentially? Michael Quenzer : Yes, normal revenue seasonality. Steve Tusa : Okay. So EPS, flat, up, down 3Q. Michael Quenzer : You\u2019re just going to have the headwinds of the ramp-up in investments that we talked about that are going to be similar in Q3 and Q4. Alok Maskara : Yes. And we \u2013 as Steve, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance on EPS. We don\u2019t want to be kind of caught in trying to give one. Steve Tusa : Okay. All right. All right. You could have just said that before, I would have, wouldn\u2019t have pushed. So yes. I probably would have pushed anyway. So moving along. The commercial business, so what is the revenue breakout of that today from an end market perspective? Michael Quenzer : Yes, it\u2019s about 50% HVAC, 30% refrigeration, 20% service. Steve Tusa : But then like end market-wise, what I meant? Michael Quenzer : Oh, end market? Steve Tusa : For commercial equipment. Alok Maskara : Yes. Within commercial equipment we talked about majority fee account, a little bit in emergency replacement. We don\u2019t break it out by vertical. If you\u2019re looking for like what\u2019s education, what\u2019s retail, what\u2019s food service, we don\u2019t give that out. Steve Tusa : Okay. Got it. All right. Thanks a lot. Alok Maskara : Thanks. Michael Quenzer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Gautam Khannal with TD Cowen. Gautam Khannal : Hey, good morning guys. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khannal : I wanted to ask about the state program to utilize some of the IRA incentives. It looks like a handful of states have been approved, and I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re actually seeing it in, how you guys are going to market, how your dealers going to market? Is it actually stimulating sales at this point? Alok Maskara : First of all, I think it went better than I expected, Gautam. Last time you and I chatted, I thought we\u2019d never see that money, but the fact that a bunch of the states have actually applied and making progress. So that is better than we expected. Second, I would say, is we are very well positioned given our direct-to-dealer and our Lennox pros and our engines, which calculate all the rebates and incentives, all of that to put together the right proposal for dealers, I think we are better positioned than most. Thirdly, we\u2019ll let to really answer your question, no, we haven\u2019t seen a meaningful impact of that yet. If the current trend continues, and it\u2019s keep getting the approval and put that through, it still would be end of the year/early next year where we\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019ll start seeing some of those come through. There is some technical hurdles to be managed through that but the progress, honestly, better than the skeptical side of me had thought it would be six months ago. Gautam Khannal : That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the third-party channel. I\u2019m just curious, given the higher rate environment, we\u2019re done with destocking. Do you think there will be any meaningful lease stocking or will they be reticent to carry much inventory given the carrying costs are higher? Alok Maskara : Still a bit unknown there. I mean honestly, I would because a lot of those folks think more in terms of dollars versus units and dollars might still be up given the inflation impact over the past two years. I think folks are going to be more disciplined than, let\u2019s say, the R-22 transition in other places. But I do think there could be a meaningful amount of people building up inventory just because of uncertainty and the history of some of the manufacturers who don\u2019t always get this transition right. So I think it will be less than that. But a higher rate environment means we didn\u2019t bake in a lot around pre-buy and anything else in our forecast because of exactly what you said, Gautam, about the interest rate environment. But if industry starts not meeting demand or there\u2019s some disruption that\u2019s coming in the air, distributors are typically risk averse, and they will start building up inventory. Capital is still available. It just costs a little more. Gautam Khannal : Thank you. Alok Maskara : Thanks. Operator : Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox\u2019s 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead. Chelsey Pulcheon : Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we share a remarkable 2024 third quarter results. Joining me is CEO, Alok Maskara, and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation, and the webcast archived link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3 as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara. Alok Maskara : Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. Lennox delivered another record quarter, highlighted by double-digit revenue growth, operating margin exceeding 20%, and strong free cash flow. We also made solid progress on multiple key initiatives as part of our ongoing transformation plan. I am grateful for our talented team and the growth mindset of our customers who enabled these exceptionally strong results. Let's turn to Slide 3 for the highlights of this quarter. Core revenue grew 15% and our adjusted segment margin expanded 90 basis points to a Q3 record of 20.2%, resulting in adjusted earnings per share increase of 24% to $6.68. We generated an impressive $452 million in operating cash flow this quarter, which is $139 million or approximately 44% increase over the same quarter last year. Our industry-leading ROIC also grew to 47%. Both our segments, HCS and BCS, achieved 15% revenue growth in the quarter and both continued to deliver strong segment profit. Investments in manufacturing capacity and front-end redesign has enabled us to gain share and meet customer demand for R-410A products. In addition, investments in digital processes and distribution technologies led to improved order fill rates within Home Comfort Solutions. The new commercial factory startup remains on track and the Building Climate Solutions segment successfully integrated the AES acquisition ahead of schedule. These results reflect the dedication of our 14,000 employees and the continued support of our dealers and customers. Therefore, I am confident in raising our 2024 EPS guidance range to $20.75 to $21. Now please turn to Slide 4 for more details on our CLO transition. As announced earlier this morning, John Torres, Lennox's Chief Legal Officer has elected to retire. I want to take a moment to acknowledge John's outstanding 16 years of leadership and his lasting impact on Lennox. He led multiple acquisitions and divestitures to streamline our portfolio and ensure that we operate with the highest ethical standards by strengthening our ethics and compliance office. As a result of our thoughtful succession planning, we are excited for Monica Brown as she takes on the role of Chief Legal Officer effective January 1, 2025. Monica has been with Lennox for 12 years with a proven track record across our businesses and legal functions. Before joining Lennox, she spent nearly 13 years with the leading outside law firm. Looking ahead, Monica is well-positioned to continue John's legacy of success with a focus on advancing our digital capabilities and accelerating future growth. Now let me hand the call over to Michael to take us through the details of our Q3 financial performance. Michael Quenzer : Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. We are pleased to report our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. This quarter, we increased our adjusted segment margin by 90 basis points and achieved a remarkable 15% revenue growth, resulting in 24% adjusted EPS growth. Now I will share more details on our third quarter financial results. Core revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, up nearly $200 million from last year, attributed mostly to volume gains in both segments. Adjusted segment profit increased by $52 million or 21%, driven by $86 million in volume as well as price and mix benefits. This was partially offset by regulatory transition costs and expenses related to our new commercial factory ramp-up. Ongoing investments also impacted profits as we are committed to strategic initiatives in sales and distribution to support consistent profitable growth. The tax rate was 18.7% and diluted shares outstanding were $35.8 million compared to $35.7 million in the prior year quarter. Let's now turn to Slide 6 and review the third quarter financial performance of the Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 15% revenue growth, 25% segment profit growth, and an impressive 170 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. Sales volumes increased by 11%, fueled by over 30% growth in our two-step distributor channel, primarily reflecting normal restocking after several quarters of industry-wide destocking. Our one-step contractor channel saw modest volume growth supported by R-410A availability compared to the broader market. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw early signs of R-410A provide demand. Pricing execution has been a key focus for the HCS segment over the past year, driving 4% revenue growth in the quarter. Having successfully met our 2024 price improvement targets, we are now concentrating on pricing for the new R-454B products and these initiatives are progressing well. Finally, our quarterly profit was impacted by anticipated product cost challenges during our transition to our new R-454B products and for ongoing investments aimed at enhancing our distribution capabilities and improving the overall customer experience. Moving on to Slide 7. The Building Climate Solutions segment also delivered an impressive 15% revenue growth in the third quarter, 6% of which can be attributed to inorganic growth from our AES acquisition. We are very pleased with this acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. The integration was finished ahead of schedule and we have delivered better than expected AES profit margins, driven by additional synergies. From an organic growth perspective, sales volume was up 7% in the quarter but was constrained by manufacturing challenges and new factory ramp-up inefficiencies that limited production output. Segment profit increased by $9 million, though profit margin declined due to anticipated manufacturing ramp-up costs. Production startup at our new commercial factory in Saltillo, Mexico, remains on track. However, total manufacturing output for commercial HVAC continues to be below demand levels. For emergency replacement, we have started offering products in some pilot markets and early results are encouraging. Please turn to Slide 8, where I will review our cash flow performance and capital deployment strategies. Operating cash flow for the quarter totaled $452 million compared to $313 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $40 million, representing $1 million increase year-over-year. Our cash flow performance has been solid this year, reflecting ongoing efforts to drive revenue growth, expand profit margins, and optimize working capital. Earlier this year, we implemented working capital initiatives with a focus on accounts payable, which has been a driver of the $183 million increase in year-to-date operating cash flow. In the coming years, we will unlock additional working capital by leveraging digital tools and efficient processes. Our return on invested capital, ROIC, stands at 47%, an industry-leading figure that remains resilient across business cycles due to high non-discretionary replacement demand. We continue to expand ROIC year-over-year, while also making capital investments that are poised to deliver substantial benefits in the coming years. Finally, we maintain a healthy balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.8 times, down from 1.8 times in the prior year. Our free cash flow deployment strategy remains focused on driving annual dividend growth and executing bolt-on acquisitions. We have reinitiated buybacks in the third quarter and we'll continue leveraging share repurchases to efficiently return excess cash to shareholders. If you will now turn to Slide 9, I will review our revised 2024 financial guidance. After the third quarter results and more visibility into the last quarter of the year, we have raised our full year revenue guidance. The table on the left summarizes our full year revenue growth factors. Total company core revenue is now projected to increase by approximately 10%. We now expect mid-single digit improvement in sales volumes, combined price and mix to be up low-single digits, and our AES acquisition to contribute low-single digit growth. As a result of our strong third quarter profit performance, we are raising our full year earnings per share guidance to $20.75 to $21 from the previously guided range of $19.50 to $20.25. We are also raising our free cash flow guidance to $575 million to $650 million. As you can see, most of our other guide points have not changed except for interest expense, which is now estimated to be approximately $45 million. Overall, year-to-date performance combined with increased clarity on industry demand has given us the confidence to significantly raise our earnings per share guidance. With that, please turn to Slide 10, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of the low GWP Refrigerant transition. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Michael. All necessary preparations for design, engineering, and manufacturing of the low GWP products were completed earlier in the year, ensuring a successful launch in the third quarter. As part of this transition, we are also excited to introduce our new Lennox powered by Samsung Mini-Split and VRF heat pump systems. We have invested heavily in developing new low GWP products and minimizing disruptions during the transition. We anticipate continued manufacturing cost headwinds into the first quarter of next year as we continue to convert production lines in our factories. Our approach to reconfiguring our factories balances production flexibility with cost efficiency. In 2025, we expect a gradual shift in demand for the new low GWP Refrigerant products. The first half of the year, specifically the first quarter, we'll see continued R-410A sales from manufacturers, distributors, and dealers as everyone depletes their regular and pre-bought R-410A inventory. We still estimate that for the full year, approximately 65% of the end-market demand will transition to low GWP product, which will favorably impact mix. Looking further ahead, we anticipate existing 410A refrigerant will face price increases as supply items and demand moves towards low GWP products. This will increase cost pressure on repairs, leading to higher demand for system replacements. This transition also opens more service opportunities for dealers and contractors given additional safety features and components in the new R-454B products. We expect some of the low GWP price and mix benefits to extend into 2026 as the market fully transitions to the new low GWP product. With that, please turn to Slide 11 for our early thinking on the outlook for 2025. We are pleased with the resilience of the North America HVAC industry growth. We remain cautiously optimistic for 2025, given our sustained competitive momentum from our ongoing transformation journey. On the left-hand side of the slide, you will see several factors that will likely impact revenue growth in 2025. Mix benefits from the low GWP transition with 10% plus price increases will accelerate growth. Lennox has historically executed extremely well during these regulatory transitions, gaining share and confidence from our dealers and distributors. We plan to do the same thing next year. We anticipate higher manufacturing output from our commercial HVAC factories within our BCS segment. In conjunction with the investment we made in our sales team this year, we will be able to recapture some of the previously lost share in the emergency replacement market. Moreover, these improvements will instill greater confidence in our ability to serve national accounts with a full lifecycle value proposition. We are encouraged by the growth opportunities from partnering with Samsung for our ductless heat pump offering, strengthening brand recognition, and providing access to a broader customer base. Increased incentives for energy-efficient system may lead to higher replacement demand as well as a higher tier mix. While we are generally optimistic about 2025 revenue growth, it is important to recognize our outlook can be impacted by several end-market factors. Uncertain consumer confidence continues to pose challenges alongside a trend towards more value tiered products, which may negatively impact mix. Higher cost for the new products may also create complexities in the ongoing repair versus replace dynamics. From an industry perspective, we expect destocking in the first half of 2025 as distributors sell through R-410A pre-buys this year. Additionally, competitors may gain some share as they overcome their current availability challenges. On the right-hand side of the slide, we have highlighted key drivers for margin expansion. We anticipate margin improvements from the low GWP product mix with 30% incrementals, supported by our continued focus on price cost discipline. We also foresee improvements in productivity from higher distribution fill rates as our focus on digital inventory planning and our investment in distribution technologies start to generate results. Greater factory efficiency will also contribute to our margin expansion, particularly in the second half of next year as we begin to lap the ramp-up costs associated with the new commercial factory and low GWP transition. However, these gains may be partially offset by several factors. Our investments in digital capabilities and distribution network improvements are essential for enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer experience. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they may create some near-term pressure on margins. Additionally, we anticipate inflationary pressures for both commodities and component cost. We also expect increases in healthcare and employee benefit costs. Ultimately, our focus in 2025 remains on superior execution to drive differentiated growth and expand margins. We will provide further financial guidance when we report our Q4 earnings early next year. Now please turn to Slide 12. As we wrap up today's call, I want to emphasize our confidence in driving sustainable growth guided by five key elements of our strategic transformation plan. Our first focus is on accelerating growth by adding new customers as well as capturing a greater share of wallet from existing customers. Second, we will expand our margins from price cost productivity and leveraging the strength of our direct-to-dealer network. Third, the Lennox unified management system remains key to our success, helping us streamline operations, share best practices, and execute our strategy. Next, our ongoing investments in digital and heat pump technology keep us at the forefront of innovation to deliver cutting-edge solutions for our customers. And finally, our strong culture rooted in core values and reinforced by our pay-for-performance model drives our success. Our differentiated strategy continues to create sustained competitive advantages and will enable us to achieve our long-term goals. I'm incredibly proud of what we have accomplished so far and I have no doubt that our best days are still ahead of us. Thank you. We will be happy to take your questions now. Margo, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Tommy. Tommy Moll : Alok, I want to start on the A2L commentary that you've provided. I hear you talk about the 10% plus pricing tailwind versus the R-410A product, and then also about some early success with initiatives in recent weeks or months I guess. So if we pull all this together, am I correct in saying that, number one, the magnitude of the pricing mix tailwind is unchanged versus prior expectations? And then number two, that your conviction in successfully realizing that is higher now that you've introduced some product into the market, albeit at low volumes. Alok Maskara : I would say both are true, Tommy. The third thing I would add to is the competitive share gain that we get normally during any regulatory transition, the confidence in achieving that in this transition is also higher. Tommy Moll : Thank you. Looking at the 2025 early thinking slide you provided, Alok, I wanted to unpack what you're referencing here in terms of the trend for the value tier and then the repair versus replaced? What have you seen to date on those points? And then what do you want to make sure to communicate about how that might evolve into next year? Thank you. Alok Maskara : Yes, what we have seen so far is not a meaningful shift between repair and replace, and -- but we continue to be cautious about it, especially given that the price of new equipment will rise. So we continue to monitor that and that's why I want to call it out. On the value tier shift, as we went from sort of 13 SEER to 14 SEER and as we look at the overall state of the economy, we have seen a shift towards more people buying the minimum SEER. It already used to be about 60%, 65% of the industry, so now it might be 65% to 70% of the industry. So that's what we are calling out in the value tier. No surprises, no changes from any of our previous conversations, just wanted to lay out the positives and the potential watch out for 2025, but really no change in Q3 that we are calling out. Tommy Moll : Noted. Thank you, Alok. I'll turn it back. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is just on the 65% next year that will be A2L. Can you just talk about some of the assumptions you're making there? And then would you say the risk is to the upside there or to the downside? I know that is kind of a hard question, but. Alok Maskara : It is a hard question, but Ryan, we are here to answer your hard questions. Listen, I think the risk right now is fairly balanced around the number 65%. If you remember earlier in the year, we were talking about 50% to 65%, but right now we feel more confident around the 65% number. I think if it's a little lower, it could be because there is more pre-buy in 410A, which we will see in Q4. And if it's higher, it will because a lot of the competitors already out of 410A inventory right now. So as we're selling 410A, it could be used this quarter versus being left over for next year. So those are kind of the two dynamics on the 410A that we are selling today, does that land up becoming pre-buy, which I think is some chances or it's just because competitors are short on that product. So those will be the pluses and minuses on that, Ryan. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. And then just on the pre-buy, clearly that helped the quarter. As we think about the first half of '25, can you quantify the magnitude just so we can set our models correctly? Alok Maskara : Sure. So on the pre-buy, I'm not sure how much it helped Q3. I mean, if you think about Q3, what helped us was three different factors. First of all, the end of destocking and beginning of restocking, I mean, that was probably the largest contributor. As you saw, our two-step business was up over 30% or around 30%, so I think that's the biggest factor for what helped in Q3. Second, I would call out is just share gains. I mean, we've been gaining share just because of better execution and there was some impact of competitors running out of inventory. So I think share gains were the second factor. Third, which may have happened a little bit towards the tail end of the quarter is pre-buy. But remember, most of our business goes to dealers and unless they go start renting out big bonds, I mean, they're not going to be able to do a lot of pre-buy, and distributor inventory levels are still pretty close to normal. So I just want to emphasize the point on the pre-buy on how we expect. What we would expect, as said, is in Q1 next year, there clearly will be some depletion or destocking of pre-buy, maybe some carryover in Q2, but that gives us confidence in the 65% number, saying majority of the sales next year will be 454B. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we'll next go to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Go ahead. Joseph O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start on the market share comments that you've made. I mean, I think that going back to 2018 time period in tornado and a period of time of maybe two or three years of some share headwinds, it seems like over the past couple of years, those have reversed and you've been on a share gain trajectory. But can you just level set in terms of through these periods of time, how much you may have given up, how much you've recaptured net-net, where do you stand today, and how you're thinking about those share gain opportunities moving forward? Alok Maskara : Sure. I'll start by reaffirming what you said is that, yes, we have reversed those share losses and we are back on a positive trajectory. Because we do both one-step and two-step, share is a little difficult as we look at AHRI or any of those data. But today, where we stand because of all the moving pieces, we are confident that we have gained share and we continue to gain share. What we have to do next year is make sure that we can retain most of the captured share, because as competitors have inventory, which many of them don't right now on 410A product, then there would be like a lot of our effort going towards making sure our share gains are more permanent. On the commercial side, where also the share gain comment comes up, we have not been able to recover the share so far. That\u2019s part of our plan for 2025 on getting share back on the emergency replacement, because we are still constrained by manufacturing capacity, not demand in that segment. So I want to separate the shared comments into commercial and residential. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then, just wanted to circle back on the 454B pricing commentary and you've noted that the initiatives are progressing well, any color that you can provide on what that means in terms of or with respect to the 10% plus price? And I think there is still debate out there on how to think about that price and list versus realized, so any clarification there when you talk about 10% price and if that's a realized number? Alok Maskara : I think as we finish Q4, when we have greater clarity on market movements and acceptance, we can talk about that in early Q1. Right now, the 10% is what we are looking to gain out of a price. But realize, we'll apply to only 65% of sales and only the products that are 454B, and we will also be raising price on 410A next year. So the 10% has to be taken in conjunction with 410A pricing today. So there are a lot of moving pieces and we can provide greater clarity. But the overall where we are seeing in the marketplace is the higher cost products that we're introducing, 454B, is being supported by our and competitive moves on 10% plus price increase into 2025. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And next we're going to go to Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Hammond : Hi, good morning, guys. Alok Maskara : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond : Just -- I appreciate all the color on that 25 moving pieces. If we just kind of looked at the market today, what do you think that res unit and commercial unit kind of market growth looks like as you snap a line into '25? I know there is a number of moving pieces, some noise with the pre-buy, but just kind of underlying unit demand in each of the businesses. Alok Maskara : If you think about res and we talked about this earlier in the year that we expected for a dealer the volume to be flat-to-down, then halfway through the year, we upgraded to be flat, and now we're going to say flat to maybe slightly up is where we are on the res side. And I'm talking about installed units, away from stocking, destocking, but think of flat as the conservative, flat to slightly up as maybe a little bit more, like aggressive numbers to look at. But it's hard to come to that in a firm number as you know with the different moving pieces. Michael Quenzer : Yes, I think what we need to do is see this Q4 pre-buy play out and see kind of how that impacts the end-market demand as well as share gain initiatives as we've talked about. Normally, we've executed better than others during this transition. So those are two unknowns that we need to see how they play out over the next quarter. Alok Maskara : So we'll wait for AHRI, but I think flat to slightly up would be a good way to look at end-market non-residential. On commercial, since we remain supply-constrained, we just go with the industry figures, where I think the market has been growing slightly. It's still not fully recovered from the COVID decline that it happened, because our markets, remember, we don't have offices, we don't have as much multi-storey housing, what we call commercial is typically retail single-storey buildings. So from that perspective, we do see that market continuing to do -- grow low-single digits at the end-market. And on resi, I'm more optimistic about lower interest rates, better -- like market performance going into next year. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just in commercial, maybe let us -- remind us your mix in education and there has been a lot of funding -- ESSER funding around K through 12 and I know that's been a hot market. If you're seeing any signs that as that sunsets that market might see a move back. Alok Maskara : We had not seen any signs of that market going back. Our exposure in education is probably less than some of our competitors, given like, historically, we have been so focused on retail, but we look at that as a good growth opportunity. But currently, we don't see any of that slowing down as we see also schools issuing bonds and other pieces, because these are very necessary maintenance and many of these units remain way past their useful life. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. JeffSprague: Hi, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Hi, Alok, I just want to come back to kind of the share gain dynamics and we got to hop over and see what else Watsco is saying this morning, but you're kind of putting the share gain largely being a function of some competitors running out of 410A, where they sound like maybe there is actually some bigger problem with somebody. I'm not expecting you to kind of name -- names on competitors, but are you actually seeing somebody also struggle with the transition or there is some other kind of systematic problem with someone in the channel other than just kind of running out of 410A? Alok Maskara : Obviously, we don't know what's happening inside the hood with any of those competitors. What we know is our availability right now on 410A products is better than many of the other players and that's giving us an advantage. We also know that a lot of the investments we made last year in improving our sales team, being a better distributor, making sure we have higher fill rates, and ensuring that we have a decentralized model that gets more aggressive and focused on our typical AOR dealer, all that's paying off as well. So I do want to break out the share gains into two comments, right? One is totally consistent with everything we have been trying to do. And second, maybe some current advantage because of competition stumbles. It's part of the transition. We made a bet that throughout this year, 410A demand would be higher and the shift to 454B would only happen next year. I believe some of the competitors may have made a different bet and they may have run out of products. JeffSprague: And then thinking about the after effects of whatever pre-buy we have into next year, right, I mean the 35% of the market that's not 454B, almost by definition, right, has to be sitting in distribution by the end of the year, right, if manufacturers are running low on it now. So I mean that -- I mean that feels like really a potentially bigger air pocket early in the year than, I don't know, maybe people think. Maybe just kind of comment on that, like the -- how you see the state of distribution at the end of the year and how this kind of give back on the pre-buy might play out? Alok Maskara : Yes, sure. First of all, we will get greater clarity next year because Q4 is still just starting and we got to work through that. Our 35 number was based on that even manufacturers will have some 410A inventory like we will have 410A inventory at the end of the year that we will be selling. So like as we look at our own distribution and I think other manufacturers will likely also have 410A inventory at the end of the year. So it's not just inventory at distributors, it's inventory at manufacturers and distributors. Q1 is where we will see the most impact. I think the FX starts waning away in Q2 and that's why the 65 :35. But Jeff, I wish there was an exact science behind this or if we had full visibility and complete transparency. So this is just like us looking at what we know and coming up with an educated guess. We are going to be wrong. We just don't know whether it's going to be wrong on the upside or the downside. JeffSprague: Understood. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Stephen Volkmann : Thank you very much. Actually, I'm just going to build right off of that. Alok, wouldn't you rather be wrong by having more R-410A, so that you are price competitive further into 2025? Alok Maskara : For the whole industry, which is what we care about deeply as well, I would hope that everybody runs out of 410A by the end of the year, so we get the better mix and the transition is more seamless for our dealers. For a dealer dealing with two different product lines and training their crews and all that is just very difficult. So we want to support our dealers and I hope the entire industry runs out, which is quite likely given that some competitors already running out of 410A. But from our perspective, yes, we would like our manufacturing transition to be clean and for us to move to 454B. At the same time, we don't want to be price-disadvantaged in the first quarter when others may have 410A. So that's a daily balance we got to drive, Jeff. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. And maybe just switching to commercial, any words of wisdom as we think about how the new facility kind of ramps up through 2025 and we sort of try to model that and when the startup costs kind of go away. Alok Maskara : Yes, the startup costs will go away definitely by Q2, a large part will go away in Q1. Right now, where we are is, we are on track from the timeline perspective. I would say the startup inefficiency maybe a shade higher than what we thought originally, just because we are putting extra focus on quality and sometimes we are paying more for freight to move products back-and-forth, and we want to make sure it's a really good quality product and we take care of our customers through their transition. So I would say, you should expect by mid-next year us to be kind of running up to as we thought the capacity of the factory would be. So think of another three quarters worth of ramp-up associated with inefficiencies fading away in Q1. Michael? Michael Quenzer : Yes, I'll just add, a lot of these costs we're experiencing right now, we believe are temporary. Obviously, we're trying to launch a factory. So in the second half of next year, when that factory is fully operational, these temporary transition costs should abate. Stephen Volkmann : Great. And then just finally on that, you mentioned earlier that demand is outstripping supply on commercial, when this thing is up mid-year to normal run-rates, is that then in better balance? Alok Maskara : We know we'll be in better balance. We may still be below capacity because remember, we're only getting 20% of the potential capacity in Saltillo up and running, and if demand continues to outstrip supply, we will put up another 20%. I mean, the factory is large enough for us to be able to double our current capacity, but we are doing it 20% at a time. But yes, we'll definitely better balance and better be able to serve our customers. I mean, currently, our customer satisfaction in that is very low because we just can't meet the amount of demand and orders we have. Stephen Volkmann : Yes. Helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alok, that you clearly -- I don't have the crystal ball here, but just to square those comments on your own inventory levels exiting the year, is the way we should think about it that you expect to carry inventory levels of 410A products to at least meet demand for the first quarter and that's really kind of like the balance that you're trying to make sure you get right. Alok Maskara : Approximately, the reason I say is, like remember, we are also a distributor and 70% of our sales act just like a distributor sale, and if we turn inventory five times a year, which I know we do around that much, I will have 410A inventory just from phase in, phase out perspective that we will sell through in Q1. So I think some of it is just practical constraints of transition, and other is, of course, we do want to remain competitive. So while it's not a goal, I think that's just largely how it will play out, because we will continue manufacturing till the time we can. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And then just maybe just sticking on pricing for 410A, given that the products are going to be discontinued going into next year, does that change the pricing dynamics that you're able to put through in the early part of next year as you typically put your annual price increases through, or how should we kind of think about that 410A pricing even for the portion of the year that it held into the network in early 2025? Alok Maskara : First of all, we want to take care of our customers and be fair, but second, from a demand and supply perspective, if 410A is short in supply, which is what we are experiencing right now, then we fully expect to capture the incremental pricing in 2025 or any 410A product sold in 2025. When we do annual price increases, I mean cost of benefits are going up, cost of -- lot of the commodities continue to be around inflation in wages, so yes, we fully expect to have 410A sold in 2025 to be at higher price than 410A sold in 2024. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great to hear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Alok, maybe first off, there is some sort of interesting bits and pieces on the margins I suppose on Slide 11, maybe trying to wrap it together. So I think your margin -- your operating margin this year is guided up about a point for the year as a whole, just total Lennox, so it's sort of 30%-ish incremental margin. When we look at the bits and pieces on Slide 11, is the main takeaway that it's a similar incremental next year or is there something I'm missing on some of the moving parts on Slide 11? Michael Quenzer : I think, overall, we expect our margins to expand at both next year, predominantly led by the mix benefits that we'll see. Then offsetting some of that will be some of the investments we're making. We're going to have at least a 30% incremental on the mix and then we'll get some more volume tailwinds hopefully in share, which is also 30% incremental. We'll have to go through all the puts and takes and some of the investments we're making, but 25% to 30% incremental sound in the range, but we got to go through all the details still. Alok Maskara : Yes, and Julian, remember our long-term targets for Lennox margins that we have published, I mean, we are still not there. So we obviously want to keep making progress towards that over the next year, year and a half to get there. So I don't want to give you exact number because Q4 still has to play out depending on how that goes, but we do expect margin expansion next year for sure. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up, revisiting sadly the pre-buy stuff again. So I guess, it sounds like if we're trying to quantify it, we should not be too concerned, if that's right for a couple of reasons about the extent of the destock. I think one is, if I look at your residential volume guide for this year, it's gone up about three points, I think, for the year versus what you said in July, but a lot of that is share gain. So you've got maybe, I don't know, a point of effect from pre-buy this year. And then also if the effect is mostly in Q1 of next year, Q1 is typically a very small seasonal quarter anyway for you, and particularly so for cooling product, which presumably is what the refrigerant change affects rather than hot products. So maybe just clarify for me if I'm misunderstanding anything with those points, please. Alok Maskara : First of all, you're not misunderstanding, Julian, this is the -- your classic quote, if I can quote back to you like analyzing storm and a teacup, right? I mean, our industry is over-analyzed sometimes. I think companies that execute well have a strong strategy to do better. But yes, your math is about correct. I mean, we -- 70% of our shares are kind of immune to this whole pre-buy discussion and that's going to work as planned. The other 30%, we believe majority of the effect right now is stocking, destocking, not pre-buy. Having said all of that, Q4 is still out there. I mean, if Q4 has a very heavy Q -- quarter and a lot of that's driven by pre-buy, then all our answers could change and we will have to talk about that in Q1. But so far, we are assuming there will be some pre-buy but not a heavy pre-buy that impacts us this year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks for taking the questions. Really great quarter for cash generation, and as we look towards '25 and lapping some of the investments you've made on the CapEx side, and I think in the past, you talked about getting back to 100% free cash flow generation -- 100% free cash flow conversion, how do we think about share repurchases, that picking up here in 4Q levels for '25. It had been a couple of years, but going back, it used to be pretty active on the repo front. Alok Maskara : I'll start by just saying that our new CFO is really helping to drive the free cash. He is bringing a new level of discipline, a new level of accountability, and a new level of focus on working capital management. With that, I will hand it over to Michael to actually answer that question. Michael Quenzer : And I'll just add on that. That's one of the initiatives I started is trying to align the organization on working capital management, especially as we look to get 90% or even close to 100% of free cash to net income. So it's something we're focused on over the next couple of years. But yes, we are generating a lot of cash, and our deployment strategy is going to be basically consistent where every year we're going to increase our dividend. We're going to look at our dividend yield compared to growth companies in the S&P 500, so we'll do that. And then we're also evaluating bolt-on acquisitions that have to have the right fit with the right returns on it. So we're being very disciplined in that, but we're definitely focused there. And then thereafter, it's going to be about share repurchases. We started getting back into share repurchases this quarter. We'll continue to do those, but it will be kind of a tool to efficiently deploy that capital if we don't do acquisitions. Noah Kaye : Okay. And can you talk a little bit about that acquisition pipeline and what your needs may be at this moment? Michael Quenzer : Yes. I think what we've looked at is different technologies, kind of bolt-on technologies in the commercial space. They just give us a better product offering with our commercial customers. We've looked at distribution opportunities to have a full assortment of products that we can sell through our residential distribution network. Those are two big ones. And then there is just different technologies to make our product smarter, either on the thermostats, IQ, so it's a host of things that we're looking at, but again, they got to have the right fit and the right price. Alok Maskara : And I would add to that, remember, I mean, we are also trying to be more of a distributor versus just a manufacturer and there's a big opportunity for products that our dealers buy or our key accounts buy that we don't sell today. So if we could look at appropriate products and technologies, as Michael said, and bring them into our network, that would be significantly value enhancing to our shareholders. So we are very disciplined in capital allocation, and as Michael said, we will look at all those opportunities and balance those appropriately. But it starts with strong cash flow, which I think Michael and the team are doing a great job at. Noah Kaye : Great. I'll have some follow-ups offline. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hi. I saw that the plan to build share in emergency replacement is highlighted on the outlook for '25, you've talked about this before. Can you just share some color on what it means to refocus on that business? My understanding is you will need to boost inventory in the field because you need 24-hour turnaround and the customers have to know this and it's either you're ready for that order or you miss it entirely. So what kind of working capital burden increase are you looking at to fill emergency replacement, and can you size that? Thanks. Alok Maskara : Deane, that's a very good question. Thanks. I agree with you that the going back to emergency replacement requires a lot of effort, starts with us having more manufacturing capacity, then it goes into making sure we have appropriate inventory within 24 hours and in some cases, urban market, the same day. And then finally, it also comes down to having the right feet on the street and getting all the contractors who may have gone to something else or someone else to come back and look at that fold, and we are doing all of that. Most of that working capital impact will be in 2025 and we'll be happy to come back and look at it. But I can also tell you it won't be as material because today we have excess working capital, but it's on the raw product side as we are starting factories and transitioning factories. I would look to redeploy a lot of that working capital from raw materials more into finished goods and closer to the customer. So it's a pretty heavy move, but from a financial perspective, I would expect a lot of that come from the additional draw inventory we are carrying as part of startup. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thanks. And then second question for Michael. On ROIC, Lennox is so far ahead of anyone else in industrials. I think from our coverage, you're probably -- you're nearly two times bigger versus the next closest competitor. So just kind of talk us through, as you make decisions -- investment decisions, CapEx decisions, are you looking at the ROIC impact? Do you hesitate at all on investments? I know it's a rhetorical question and you're going to just say no, but just the idea that you will at times pressure ROIC. So is this more of an outcome or a target on the way you think about it in the company? Michael Quenzer : Yes, what I'll say is that our industry-leading ROIC is mostly driven by our organic disciplined approach to investments, so we've not done a lot of inorganic acquisitions. Obviously, when you do those, they will be dilutive. But when we look at acquisitions like we did with AES, it was a good ROIC, well above 20%, but still below the 47% that we're tracking. So we'll continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions that are above our cost of capital. And then from a capital expenditure perspective, we do the same thing. So we're not necessarily targeted on growing above 47%, but we want to stay 40% and have good ROI projects on these CapEx, and so we're looking at both on the organic capital expenditures and the inorganic acquisitions to have healthy ROIC above our cost of capital. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Hi -- I wanted to come back to the early thinking on 2025 and the 30% incremental comment on low GWP, is that a volume incremental comment, and then price mix should drop through at something above that similar to this year? I'm just hoping you could maybe parse those pieces out. Michael Quenzer : Yes. What we're expecting is more of a kind of price cost. It will come through. We'll have mix-up for the pricing that we just talked about and then the drop-through on that mix will be at least 30% to maintain our gross margins and reflect the additional costs that we're having to put into the product and investments that we're making. Our volume incrementals are also similar to 30%. So we have both kind of dropping through 30% of the mix next year and our normal volume gains. Brett Linzey : Got it. And then just thinking about new versus replacement in residential, obviously, new housing has been a drag, how much was that down so far this year? And then you noted some of the value tier growth for next year. Thinking about a better housing environment and some of the investment, should you maybe pick up some share in new housing next year or grow in line with the market, any thoughts there? Alok Maskara : Yes. I think we're starting to see some green shoots in new housing, so we are like either bouncing along the bottom or we are coming off from the trough from new housing. So that's positive. And remember, we are kind of six months behind the new housing starts number that you might see. Our share position in there remains very strong. And on the replacement side, again, if you believe, even the recent Wall Street Journal article about homeowners starting to do more repairs and renovations, we think higher demand there will probably result from lower interest rates and consumer confidence. But all that said, there is just a lot of uncertainty. On the value tier, our comment was driven by because of the SEER changes, because of the pricing levels, and because of the higher interest rates that are prevailing versus a few years ago. So we just want to watch out for that going forward. So a lot more for us to analyze and evaluate before we come to you in 2025 and give you more firm guidance on those things. Brett Linzey : Thanks. Appreciate the insight. Operator : Thank you. Next we're going to go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : What do you think is driving distributors to stock up in like the last couple of months of the summer when the demand is effectively like maybe flat-to-up a little bit and you have this transition coming? What's kind of the -- what's the driver there? Alok Maskara : Yes. And I think, Steve, depends on which type of distributors. I mean, we can talk about our distributors. We haven't seen our distributors stocking up. We are seeing our distributors going away from destocking, so they're going back to normal inventory levels that existed pre-COVID and we haven't seen them taking extraordinary measures to stock up. Now, I think in Q4, they might do some 410 pre-buy to get some price advantage versus 454B. But I have not seen any -- at least from our distributors that we work with, any big push to stock up. Michael Quenzer : And all that said, on top of comps, if you go back to Q3 last year, that channel is down 20% due to destocking, so definitely favorable comps year-over-year as they restock as Alok mentioned. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then when it comes to the pricing for next year, so you're saying 10% plus on 70% of your revenue, I think 65% penetration, so that kind of gets you into firmly in the mid-single digit plus range for price for next year kind of capture for the segment, is that like the right math that you're talking about? Alok Maskara : Yes. We'll get you greater clarity in 2025 because I do -- we'll have more clarity both on like 65, 35, 454B, but I think that's roughly the right math and the way you looked at it right now. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then lastly\u2026 Alok Maskara : \u2026most of this is going to look at mix -- most is going to look at mix versus price, right, because these are brand new products. Steve Tusa : Right. So this is mix versus like just pure price, but that is the right math right now. It's around 5%, 6%. Alok Maskara : \u2026mid-single digit is a good range. Michael Quenzer : And then I'll just add, the stick rate we normally see in regulatory transitions is high because we're making a lot of cost investment as we need to stick it. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just lastly, I guess with the combination of the pre-buy for the industry at least maybe perhaps more, some of the things you talked about is being uncertain as far as consumer confidence, repair versus replace all that, do you expect like industry volumes next year at this stage to be down -- industry volumes? You've talked about your share gains, but is industry volume down next year, do you think? Alok Maskara : Listen, from my perspective, I would say the industry volume -- and this is installed on the ground, so away from any like distributor stock-in or stock-out and all that, I would think it's going to be flat to slightly up next year and a lot of that's just driven by the ongoing trends, age of units, and the cost of repair versus replays. But I wish I could predict that more accurately, Steve. Everybody is going to have a different view on that. Michael Quenzer : And interest rates are going to have a heavy influence in that as well. Steve Tusa : Right. And then sorry, one more question. Alok Maskara : Remember, new home construction is picking up, so right. Steve Tusa : Yes. Sorry, one more question from maybe the guy that over-analyzes, as you said, whatever the comment was. The share gains this year with your competitors that have been like out of the market, why are those sustainable? Why isn't that like a tough comp in the next year? Are they -- is this kind of structural share gain you think you've taken because of that? Alok Maskara : Whenever somebody stumbles, some of that becomes permanent, like when we stumbled with the tornado, it took us years, like six years, to get that share back. So when I look at our past tumbles, some dealers will switch back, some won't, so -- I mean that's my part. Our comment is, our goal is to make them as permanent as possible. But that is where execution comes down and see what works. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. We covered a lot of ground and let's not over-analyze this situation, but what is the feedback from your end customers, the contractors, the dealers on A2L? Have they come to terms with the technology, the train requirements, et cetera? Do they actually want to have A2L or do they want to take as much 410A as they can? And I'm just wondering this dynamic of 4Q versus 1Q, if you're going to increase prices effective 2025, is there an incentive for them to stock up in 4Q versus 1Q? Alok Maskara : Yes, so talking about end contractors, I mean, the good news is we are belly-to-belly with 10,000 of them, and I can tell you all 10,000 have 10,000 -- like individual views. So depending on whom you ask, you will get that view. In general, I would say, most contractors would prefer to continue doing what they are doing. They are chain resistant, but they also realize that they don't have a choice and they have to move to 454B. It only comes down to some of them, especially the high-end one will want to move sooner versus later because they are selling a high-end product and they are not at the bottom end of the range. Others who are more chuck in the truck and at the bottom end of the range, they will want to keep doing 410A as long as possible. On the positive side, it's been well accepted. People have gone through training. People understand how to install it. We are spending a lot of time doing training. Other distributors are doing a lot of time doing training, so that will happen. Is there a risk that some of them will stock up more on 410A at the end of the quarter because they do have garages and barns, they may not have warehouses? Yes, I think there is a risk to that. I mean, that's a risk we deal with every year. Nigel Coe : Yes, okay. I'm -- just got the vision of barns being used to stock up HVAC units. We have to do some barn visits. And then just a... Alok Maskara : I was at a barn in Wisconsin, and actually, you saw that, so. Nigel Coe : Yes, side-by-side with the cheese. Then just -- thinking then about just dis-conceptually the repair versus replace dynamic, if we're in a 454B world and you've got a 410A system or 20 system, you're going to have to replace the whole system as opposed -- if you're going to replace instead of just a component replacement, et cetera. So why wouldn't there be more kind of compressor replacements or motor replacements or whatever in a world where we're putting through another 10% price? So I'm just trying to figure out here whether we will see kind of more of a repair mix as we transition through this A2L. Does it make sense? Alok Maskara : I think fundamentally - you did, absolutely. I still think it comes down to the age of the unit. So if the unit is five-year-old and it's got a compressor broken, the dealer is likely to come and change the compressor. If it's a, 12 to 15-year-old unit where the compressors broken and the motor is making noises, they are likely to replace the whole system. In the 12 to 15-year-old unit, because the extra cost of 410A, once it spikes and it has not spiked yet, it becomes an additional factor that comes into play. So I don't think -- just like the R22 to 410A pieces, in the beginning years, it didn't change the repair to replace, but in the future years, it did move it more towards replacement versus repair. I think the same thing is going to happen, probably no impact in 2025 for repair versus replace, but in future years it will. Nigel Coe : Great. And then just a quick one, I'm probably the last question here. Have you sized the dollar TAM for the emergency replacement market for commercial? What sort of share do you think you can get of that TAM? Alok Maskara : We haven't sized or broadcast that yet, but we know what we used to have, and we also know that the industry broadly has a healthy mix between emergency replacement and key account and we are essentially almost all key accounts. So the industry is 60 :40. We are probably 90 :10 in that, in terms of 90% key account and 10% emergency replacement. So we do know we have a significant opportunity for us to take that forward. You can take that and multiply it by AHRI industry data, but the industry is a lot more weighted towards emergency replacement than we are. Maybe next year we will come back and give you some sizing on that. Nigel Coe : Great. That's great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's 2024 third quarter conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

All lines are currently in listen-only mode and there will be a question-and-answer session at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chelsey Pulcheon from the Lennox Investor Relations team. Chelsey, please go ahead. Chelsey Pulcheon : Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we share our 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. Joining me is CEO, Alok Maskara; and CFO, Michael Quenzer. Each will share their prepared remarks before we move to the Q&A session. Turning to Slide 2, a reminder that during today's call, we will be making certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as outlined on this page. We may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management considers relevant indicators of underlying business performance. Please refer to our SEC filings available on our Investor Relations website for additional details, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP measures. The earnings release, today's presentation, and the webcast archive link for today's call are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.lennox.com. Now please turn to Slide 3, as I turn the call over to our CEO, Alok Maskara. Alok Maskara : Thank you, Chelsey. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to our 14,000 employees, our 10,000 plus dealers and all of our customers for their loyalty and innovation that enabled us to deliver an exceptionally strong finish to 2024. One of the highlights for 2024 is that for the first-time ever, Lennox delivered over $5 billion in revenue, and over $1 billion in adjusted segment profit. Another achievement in 2024 is that both our segments delivered double-digit revenue growth. In addition to delivering record results, we also made thoughtful investments such as starting a new commercial factory to create growth capacity. Let us turn to Slide 3 for the fourth quarter and full year 2024 overview. Adjusted earnings per share was a record $5.60 for the quarter and $22.58 for the full year. Core revenue grew 22% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. Our adjusted segment margin expanded 250 basis points in Q4, and 150 basis points for the full year to 19.4%. The team also delivered a record $332 million in operating cash flow in the quarter and $946 million in the full year. Michael will provide more details later in the presentation, but I want to highlight how proud we are of the work the team did this year to deliver significant year-over-year improvement in our cash conversion. Now please turn to Slide 4, as I review some of the drivers of our 2024 success. In 2024, we successfully completed the initial phase of our self-help transformation plan. The team's effort in '23, including pricing initiatives portfolio simplification and strategic acquisitions not only restored margins, but also established a strong foundation for an exceptional 2024. Our strategic initiative enabled us to successfully navigate the construction of a new commercial factory and overcome challenges associated with the refrigerant transition, showcasing our resilience and outstanding execution. In 2024, we continued making strategic investments while delivering impactful results, positioning us to continue our momentum into 2025 and beyond. We successfully navigated the manufacturing transition from R-410A refrigerant, effectively meeting customer needs and investments in sales and distribution channels elevated the customer experience. Our ongoing focus on pricing excellence programs partially offset the investments for improving customer experience. Our new commercial factory is now online and will be key to enhancing output and productivity. The AES integration remains ahead of schedule, exceeding the original value proposition. We maintained our strategic M&A pipeline and our disciplined M&A approach. The best deals for Lennox in 2024 were the deals that we decided not to pursue, thus safeguarding long-term shareholder value. Finally, by driving accountability through the Lennox unified management system, we ensured consistent performance. Before I hand the call to Michael, I want to extend my heart fill gratitude to Gary Bedard, President of our HCS segment since 2023, who has announced his decision to retire from Lennox. Gary's 26 year tenure at Lennox will leave a legacy that will continue to shape our future. We have initiated a search process to identify our next HCS President. I'll now hand it over to Michael, who will walk you through how we successfully invested in the business, while also delivering strong results. Michael Quenzer : Thank you, Alok. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 5. We are pleased to report our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth. This quarter, we increased our adjusted segment margin by 250 basis points and achieved an impressive 22% revenue growth, resulting in 54% adjusted EPS growth. Our success was driven by volume growth in both segments as we continue to effectively manage the transition to low GWP refrigerants. As expected, customers pre-purchased R-410A equipment, which is estimated to have positively impacted revenue by $125 million and increased earnings per share by $1. Now let's proceed to Slide 6 to review the fourth quarter financial performance of our Home Comfort Solutions segment. The Home Comfort Solutions segment had an exceptional quarter, delivering 25% revenue growth, 67% segment profit growth and an impressive 550 basis point expansion in segment profit margin. Sales volume increased by 21%, driven by over 50% growth in our two step distributor channel, primarily reflecting the industry wide R-410A equipment pre-buy. Our one-step contractor channel also saw volume increase low double-digits. This was supported by better R-410A product availability compared to the broader market as well as some prebuy. After adjusting for the prebuy, segment sales volume still grew by mid-single digits. Pricing initiatives continue to progress well. Although, the impact to the quarter was limited, we have implemented price increases on our new R-454B products, and these initiatives are progressing as expected. Moving on to Slide 7. The Building Climate Solutions segment delivered a very strong fourth quarter with revenue growing 17%. Of this growth, 3% was driven by inorganic contributions from our APS acquisition. From an organic perspective, sales volume increased 14% during the quarter. This reflects early revenue benefits from our new Saltillo, Mexico manufacturing facility as well as some R-410A equipment prebuy activity. Segment profit increased by $8 million. However, profit margin declined due to $20 million in higher product costs related to new factory ramp-up activities and inefficiencies at our existing manufacturing facility. Production output continues to grow and is well positioned to support our 2025 emergency replacement growth initiative. Turning to Slide 8. Lennox delivered an impressive performance for 2024. We successfully navigated the low GWP Refrigerant transition, achieving notable volume gains. Our disciplined pricing strategy drove consistent quarterly price yields contributing to margin expansion of 150 basis points. While strategic investments for future growth tempered this margin improvement, these investments are expected to deliver significant benefits in the coming years, including sustained revenue growth and further margin expansion. Turning to Slide 9. Let's review our cash flow and capital deployment. While revenue and earnings growth were impressive, our cash flow performance stood out even more. As highlighted in the Q3 earnings call, enhanced working capital efficiency has been a key focus. We've made significant progress, particularly in accounts payable initiatives, resulting in a free cash flow conversion rate of 97%. This strong cash flow conversion comes despite capital expenditures exceeding depreciation by approximately $65 million. Capital expenditure investments in high ROI projects remain a core component of our cash deployment strategy. Over the past two years, capital expenditures have consistently outpaced depreciation. This trend is expected to continue in 2025 with estimated capital expenditures of $150 million. We maintain a robust balance sheet with net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 0.6 times, down from 1.3 times in the prior year quarter. Our free cash flow deployment strategy continues to prioritize inorganic growth opportunities that deliver ROIC exceeding WACC within three years of acquisition. Additionally, we will continue leveraging share repurchases to efficiently return excess cash to shareholders. If you will now turn to Slide 10, I will review our 2025 full year guidance. Anticipating another year of profitable growth, let's begin with the table on the left, which summarizes our full year revenue growth drivers. Total company core revenue is projected to increase by approximately 2%. However, the 2024 prebuy will result in year-over-year revenue headwinds in both Q1 and Q4. We also expect a low-single digit increase in sales volume, driven by growth in our BCS segment. Additionally, mix growth from the introduction of the new low GWP products will contribute an estimated 4% to revenue growth. The phaseout of legacy 410A products is expected to conclude by the second quarter. Turning to the right side of the slide. We've outlined key cost assumptions for 2025. Inflation is anticipated to increase costs by approximately 3%. At the same time, we plan to make strategic investments in areas such as information system advancements, distribution growth initiatives, and projects designed to improve customer service. These investments will also include enhanced sales and marketing efforts with total investments estimated at approximately $25 million for the year. In terms of cost productivity, we expect to generate savings of $50 million as the ramp-up costs of our new BCS factory subside and material cost efficiencies are realized. In summary, even with the headwinds from the 2024 prebuy, we anticipate revenue and profit growth with profit margins relatively flat. We expect adjusted earnings per share to fall within the range of $22 to $23.50, and free cash flow is projected to fall within the range of $650 million to $800 million. With that, please turn to Slide 11, and I'll turn it back over to Alok for an overview of our 2025 priorities. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Michael. Let us revisit our self-help transformation plan which has been a cornerstone of our success since 2022. We transition from the recover and invest phase to the growth acceleration phase at the end of 2024. As we move through 2025 and into '26, we will maintain a disciplined approach to investing in the business while prioritizing growth. This year will lay the groundwork for the next phase of expansion supported by the momentum from share gains and new product introductions. Investments in digital customer experience are making it easier for customers to engage with us strengthening loyalty and satisfaction across all touch points. Our expanded heat pump offering supported by the Samsung JV not only broaden our product portfolio, but also position us to capitalize on growing demand for energy efficient solutions. Additionally, our focus on improving attachment rates for parts and accessories ensures that we provide a more comprehensive customer experience while driving incremental growth. An additional growth driver is our commercial emergency replacement program enabling us to better serve a significant segment of the market that we have been unable to fully supply in recent years. Second, we are committed to resilient profit margins. Benefits expected from the low GWP product transition, increased productivity from BCS volume improvements and material cost reductions, strengthen our ability to deliver consistent and reliable financial performance. Lastly, we will continue to utilize our Lennox unified management system to deliver superior execution with clear priorities. Defined M&A strategies, a robust distribution network and ongoing investment in customer satisfaction, underscore our commitment to operational excellence. As we look ahead, the investments made over the past two years set the foundation for growth in 2025 with a strong trajectory into 2026 and beyond as we move towards the expansion phase. With our collective commitment and strategic focus, I am confident that we are not merely executing a plan, we are creating a path for ongoing success. We remain confident in our long-term vision and given progress so far. We believe we will be within the 2026 revenue target range of $5.4 billion to $6 billion and at the high end of our ROS target range of 19% to 21%. The prebuy dynamics in 2024 will create impact in 2025, which is expected to normalize by the end of this year. Hence, we anticipate a stronger 2026 as our strategic investment expense (ph) continue to drive momentum. Now let us turn to Slide 12. Let me wrap up by summarizing the five reasons that make Lennox an attractive opportunity for all our stakeholders. First, we are 100% focused on North America growth end markets of HVACR and are accelerating growth through share gains. Second, we are expanding our resilient profit margins through pricing, productivity and mix optimization. Third, we deliver superior execution through the Lennox unified management system. Fourth, we are an advanced technology industry leader with high efficiency products and services supported by a digital customer ecosystem. Fifth, we win because our exceptional talent and culture is defined by our core values and guiding behaviors. Our pay-for-performance philosophy ensures that our internal goals are closely aligned with those of our shareholders. As I look forward, I remain confident that our best days are ahead. Thank you. We will be happy to answer your questions now. Angela, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ryan Merkel : Hey, thanks. Good morning and congrats on the nice quarter. I wanted to start with the prebuy. It looks like it was a little bigger than maybe you were expecting. Can you just comment on what you saw and why that was? And then what does it mean for 1Q? I think it's really the question I have. Alok Maskara : Hey, Ryan. Good morning. I don't think I heard the second part of the question properly. But the first part on the prebuy, listen, we are calling out $125 million in prebuy. As you can imagine, it's an estimate, you don't have 100% visibility into the number. And we know there was some cloudiness because we had temporary share gains that happened in Q4 as some of our competitors were out of product. So it's a little higher than we expected, but I would say it's within the range of where our expectations are. Michael Quenzer : And then, Ryan, on the second part of your question, the impact to Q1, really the $125 million the pull forward into Q4 from Q1. So we'll see a headwind there. And then also, you'll see that in Q4 in 2025 is the year-over-year comps won't have that as well. Ryan Merkel : Got it. Okay. So $125 million revenue in 1Q sort of the math. Then, the second question -- okay. And the second question is the flat volume outlook for the HCS segment, I mean I think it makes sense to be conservative, but just talk about some of the assumptions behind that. Alok Maskara : Sure. I mean, there's a lot of uncertainty in the market, right? I mean you saw existing home sales are at a fairly low level interest rates, mortgage rates, they continue to be high. So based on what we saw in 2024, we continue to model a flattish industry volume. It may be a little conservative, but given the uncertainty in the market, just seem like that's the right assumption to make at this point. Ryan Merkel : Yeah. That\u2019s fair. Okay. Thank you. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, good morning, guys. Great year. So look, historically, you guys have tended to guide very conservatively as I look at the components of this bridge in Slide number 10. It seems like, what you're baking in for incremental margins, if I just take into account price mix and inflation is very low, like, I'm calculating something that's like low double-digits. So just help me kind of understand number one, just like where you think there might be some potential cushion in the guide and how to think about that equation between price mix and inflation? Michael Quenzer : Hey, Joe. I think there's some opportunity potentially that Alok just mentioned there on the volume. If interest rates go down, maybe the HCS volume could give us a little bit more that obviously would come through at 30% incrementals. But if you look at the overall guide, it does imply overall margins are approximately flat at 19.4%. The inflation assumption of 3% might come in a little less. But I think right now, it feels prudent to keep inflation up there. And then obviously, we as a group, are trying to drive as much productivity as possible. So from a cost productivity perspective, we're going to focus to drive a little bit higher if we can as well. Alok Maskara : And I think the bigger issue here is the amount of uncertainty that's present. I mean if you look at noise around tariffs, if you look at noise around migrant labor and labor shortages for our dealers. And if you just look at mortgage rates, interest rates, I mean there's just a lot of uncertainty. So we went with a fairly wide range. I wouldn't call it very conservative, but I think it's consistent with what we have done in the past. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful. And then as I kind of think through just the 1Q number, I think in answering Ryan's question. So the right way to think about things sequentially in HCS is you've got, call it, $125 million that goes away 4Q to 1Q. And then there's typically like, I don't know, mid-single digit sequential step down. So is the -- you're still assuming then organic growth in HCS in the first quarter. Am I thinking about it correctly? Alok Maskara : Well, first of all, the Q1 is an estimate, right? Maybe only in January. Some of it could extend to Q2, depending on how dealers convert because we're now already selling the 454B equipment, and it just drawing like a line in the sand somewhere. But on your sequential question, maybe Michael can give you some... Michael Quenzer : Yeah. I think that's generally close, but not all $125 million was in the HCS segment, some of it was in the BCS segment. But I think as Alok said it right, we did have a little bit of R-410A inventory going into the quarter. So some of this might kind of move into Q2, but predominantly will be in Q1. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great. Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to switch tack for a second to the BCS segment and sort of the guidance there. I think people have been concerned about the revenue outlook there because you don't have AI exposure or what have you in BCS. And there are some question marks around the ESRA funding unwinding into 2026. So maybe just help us understand kind of what you're seeing in the BCS segment top line wise across different verticals, mid-single digit underlying volume growth assumption clearly speaks to, I think, a much healthier market than what a lot of investors have been thinking. Alok Maskara : Sure. I would say from our perspective, the markets that we serve remain healthy. And at least this week on Monday, seek Chinese told us that it was good not to have data center exposure in our stock. So I think from that perspective, we are not terribly concerned its exposure there was low or slash zero (ph) to start with. If I look at our exposure. It remains in places such as retail, food service, warehouses, big box, DIY-type stores. And we see the replacement volume, which is primarily our sales, actually picking up now since we have made the conversion to 454, and some of these companies have been waiting to go to the new refregent before they put more sales. Second thing underlying our confidence is that clearly, we have a new factory. We were primarily supply constrained, not demand constrained, and that was still the case in Q4. So we do expect us to get more fair share of the market, including emergency replacement that we talked about. In terms of your funding for the schools, yeah, I mean, I've heard that concern just back for the IRA, but we see most of the programs continue to move forward and some schools are issuing bonds and other things. I mean, just keep in mind, this is a non-discretionary spend. In the air conditioning breaks, you can't run these schools. So from a nature of the replacement program and the non-discretionary nature that we look at, we don't see that as a much impact and that gives us sufficient confidence on our guide. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my second one, I don't really want to mention the P word, but if we're thinking about Q1 specifically, and it's been touched on a couple of times understandably. But classically, Q1 in recent years has been a sort of 16%, 17% of the year's earnings. So not a huge quarter and I understand there's some extra pressure right now because of the refrigerants change. But if we had to put a finer point on it, is the right interpretation maybe it's a couple of points less of the full year's earnings in Q1 than one would normally expect. And then we get the full sort of catch up in the rest of the year, particularly Q2 with a big mix tailwinds coming in. Michael Quenzer : Yeah, Julian. I think I'd buck into a little different, maybe look more at the first half just because of the dynamic of things kind of shift in Q1 to Q2 with the selling out of the 410A. So from a revenue perspective, we think kind of the first half will be about 45% of the year, second half being 55%. This is a little bit different than the normal kind of 50-50. Second half of the year, you'll really start to see the mix benefit of the 454B product coming up as well as some more of the gains from the new commercial factory in the second half. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Alok Maskara : Yeah. Thanks, Julian. Operator : We'll go next to Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Noah Kaye : Thanks very much. So, Alok, we've had a couple of years now of regulatory transitions where the company has executed well and really claimed the opportunity around pricing and share gains. You mentioned in some of the factors that went into your thinking did include potential tariffs and labor and other considerations brought about by the administration change. So how would you think about your opportunities related to that? And for example, if we do have tariffs on USMCA partners and others perhaps that could be a pricing opportunity, perhaps with your investments, there's some share gain opportunities there. The essential question is, how are you thinking about contingency planning and responding to any potential changes? Alok Maskara : Sure. No, that's a great question. And things remain very dynamic, as you know. But if you take each of these, if tariffs come into more in China and less in Mexico, Canada, we would be a net beneficiary as we have done a really good job of reducing our supply chain reliance on China. And the fact that we did the Samsung JV also means that things like our mini splits are now coming from Korea, not from China. So I think that in hindsight, not just the benefit of Samsung's better quality product, but avoiding any tariffs coming from China would be a big win for us. So if there are tariffs coming in from Mexico, 40% of the industry capacity is in Mexico, roughly, which means we'll all have to work through offsetting with productivity, seeing the impact of any peso devaluation, but then offset with price. So we look at that price is going to be incremental to what we are positioned here. But clearly, there could be a delay in timing, given I'm not sure how much time we would have to react to any tariffs and tariffs announcement. On the labor piece, listen, there will be no impact to our factories. And obviously, we have a different type of employer versus people who might be doing construction or HVAC installs in the field. I think what does happened with that is since replacements require less scale and less labor versus massive repair. I think the repair versus replacement trend would probably continue shifting more towards replacement as the units are harder to repair, that requires much more skilled labor and not more labor versus higher ticket items such as full replacement. But from our contingency planning, we are staying close to our customers, close to our dealers, making sure that we can address any of those concerns and also continue to monitor tariffs and work on supply chain redundancies because we are now -- have a much heavier dual source focus than we had two to three years ago, giving us flexibility in supply chain movements. Finally, the last thing on the consumer side, which is probably going to have the biggest impact, we just need to watch consumer confidence, interest rates, mortgage rates and help our dealer offset any weaknesses that come in either through financing programs, either through really more education to the consumer and keep working with new homebuilders and others, which are more guaranteed volume for us. So I hope that answered your question, and it was a little winded. Noah Kaye : No, it was comprehensive, and I realized I asked in some at of multipart questions. So out of respect to colleagues, I'll take myself offline and follow up then. Thank you very much. Alok Maskara : Thanks, Noah. Operator : We'll go next to Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Tommy. Tommy Moll : I want to start on the topic of your 454B pricing. Are we still thinking 10% or maybe 10% plus, there's at least one OEM in the market that's less disciplined than that. And if we just look at the mix guide for Home Comfort anyway in the mid-singles range, maybe you could bridge us from whatever the 454 contribution is to how you get to that mid-singles. Michael Quenzer : Sure, Tom. Yeah. I'll give you some more clarity on that. Yes. Our plan still is a 10% price increase on average on the 454B product and that equates to about 70% of the revenue in the HCS segment. And as we've been talking about, we're going to continue to sell through some 410A equipment in the first half of this year. So it will take a little bit of time to bleed into the 454B product. So we think about 65% of the full year will be sales of the 454B product. So when you kind of do all that math, it dilutes down to that mid-single digit mix benefit for home comfort solutions. Alok Maskara : Yeah. And on the competitive question, Tommy, I mean, we have heard that too, but I also think we are talking about 2024 pricing because some of the OEMs released 454 in 2024, and we released 20%, 25% pricing. So we are optimistic that as we take this forward, all the OEMs will be our adjusting price in 2025, that typically happens in the first quarter anyway. Tommy Moll : Thank you, both. And as a follow-up, I wanted to unpack the home volume outlook a bit. So where you've talked about the prebuy as a mid-single digit headwind and then the separate volume call out you have there is flat. I just want to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly, that for the volumes that you would report in your financials that you just add those two together. So it would be a mid-single headwind. Maybe you could just clarify how we should think about that? Michael Quenzer : That's exactly right. That's exactly how to look at it. Tommy Moll : Okay. And then if we take that mid-single headwind for the segment level, can you give us any sense of the sell-in versus the sell-through assumptions you're making there? Michael Quenzer : I think you can see in the results in the fourth quarter. We were more impacted in that channel for the sell-in to the two-step channel. But we did see a little bit of a prebuy on the sell-through as well. Tommy Moll : Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate the question. You guys talked to $125 million prebuy in Q4. But if I kind of look at it next year, it's about a 2% headwind on a $5 billion plus revenue base. I guess does that imply that there's maybe like a similar amount of prebuy in the Q3 numbers as well or am I missing something in that math? Alok Maskara : Yeah, Chris. This is a great question. So what happens is if you take that $125 million, first, we will get the destocking impact of that. And let's say that's in the Q1, Q2, and then in the Q4 time frame to Q4 2025, we will face difficult comps. So that kind of impacts you twice, right? So from that perspective, that's why the number seems twice. Michael Quenzer : And then in Q1 2026, you'll get that benefit back. Alok Maskara : Right. And one is the destocking and one is the comp impact, right? Christopher Snyder : Okay. Thank you. I really appreciate that. So I guess the assumption is that there wasn't, I guess, a material prebuy impact in Q3? And then maybe just following up on that. I know it's kind of hard, I imagine to kind of triangulate and kind of pinpoint what the prebuy is. So I'd just be interested in how you guys went about doing it because obviously, a lot of focus on that in the '25? Thank you. Alok Maskara : Great. But first of all, thank you for acknowledging and we admit that it is not easy, nor is it precisely accurate, right? We think we are directionally correct, not precisely accurate on $125 million, so -- but we just wanted to give a clean number. We did not encourage any prebuys. We did have last call on 410A. So that may have for some distributors in order to order prebuy. We remain fairly neutral. And now we did not switch all our lines over to 454B as some of our competitors did, and we only did that at the tail end of the year, and we delayed that as much as possible. I believe that led to better availability for Lennox products in the marketplace when it comes to 410A product. And that gave us share gain in addition to the prebuy impact that we are talking about. Our goal is, of course, to keep as much of that share gain as we can. But realistically speaking, we have baked in that we are unlikely to keep all the share gain that we had, had. And that's one reason we are being more muted in the volume outlook for 2025. Christopher Snyder : Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : We'll go next to Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : Yeah. First question is on the new commercial Mexico facility. So you're moving from the piloting to the production, you said its online. Are you able to quantify what you're embedding in 2025 in terms of the volume contribution and better throughput there? Michael Quenzer : Yeah. If you look at the volume guide in BCS, we're up about mid-single digits. There's a few points in there for share gain, which would be predominantly related to the new factory supply improvement. Brett Linzey : Okay. Got it. And I imagine that's a little more back-end loaded or should we think about that as progressing evenly through the year? Michael Quenzer : A little more back-end loaded. I mean the season for emergency replacement is predominantly Q2 to Q3. So kind of starting more in late Q2 into Q3 is when it'll start to ramp up. Brett Linzey : And then just a follow-up on the inefficiencies in the existing facility. Maybe just a finer point there. Was that Arkansas late in the year? And then any update on the status of those improvements into January? Alok Maskara : Sure. Yeah. I think the existing facility inefficiencies were related to the startup as we got a lot of components from Stuttgart during ramp-up to send to Mexico and do trial runs and otherwise. But yeah, that was late in the year. And it was on the higher end of what we were expecting, so those inefficiencies, which obviously, we will capture back in 2025 as we are through the ramp-up phase. But yes, it was Stuttgart then the ramp-up vision in start, but Stuttgart was the bigger impact. The factory in Stuttgart is doing much better. And frankly, having the new factory in Saltillo means we are going to reduce the number of SKUs we manufacture in Stuttgart as some of the emergency replacement SKUs move over to Saltillo. So we are more optimistic on recovering. But as you know, that's been a difficult factor for many years. So fingers crossed, we are optic for this year. Brett Linzey : All right. Appreciate the insight. Operator : We'll go next to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Joseph O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Alok Maskara : Good morning. Joseph O'Dea: I think, Michael, you touched on maybe the inflation has a bit of conservatism in there, but can you unpack that a little bit? That's 3% inflation, presumably cost across all costs. And so you're talking sort of labor materials, freight, kind of all in bundled. And anything in particular where you're seeing more of the sort of inflationary headwinds coming through? Michael Quenzer : Yes. It's on average on all of our costs, we have about $4 billion of costs. We're seeing higher inflation in SG&A around health care and some of the wages that are more than the 3%, a little bit lower on the commodity side. But in general, it kind of blends to 3%. I think we'll continue to watch it and like I said, there could be some conservatism, but inflation definitely continues to exist and especially on some of the SG&A side. Alok Maskara : And keep in mind that some of the tariff uncertainty impacts that as well. If there are tariffs on things like steel, then we clearly want to acknowledge that and be prepared for that. Joseph O'Dea: Right. But I guess -- so the idea is that, that price in the revenue bridge of 1% compares to inflation of 3%. So you're not going out to the market and saying, we have a right to get more because the costs were getting burdened with. Michael Quenzer : Correct. I mean we had some of that through the mix as well that we're getting a little bit better incrementals to cover for some of that, but we're also looking to drive more productivity as well. Alok Maskara : And keep in mind, the 454B, we could have put in mix and price, you put that in mix. So you've got to think of a lot of that is covering inflation as well. Joseph O'Dea: Right. Okay. And then just as it relates to that 454B price and the 10% you talked about, which I think is the HCS side, not the BCS side, but that 10% at what point in the year do you think you'll have confidence and visibility to kind of realization just when we think about the seasonality of the business, trying to understand kind of when you'd really get a good sense of that 10% sticking? Alok Maskara : I think the mid to late Q2 when we'll get a good sense because we also -- make some of the OEMs have not announced their 2025 pricing. So that's when we get a good sense of it. But so far, the early signs are positive. I mean there's no reason for us to be concerned about it. The reason the impact is what we called out is it 70% or 70% of that 10%. So that's why you kind of see the numbers what they are, which means progressively as we go towards the second half, we'll have a greater portion of that getting captured. But right now, there's no reason to ever or be concerned with that number. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Alok Maskara : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Hammond : Just a few cleanups. So just on the Mexican production, you said industry capacity 40%. Can you just level set us on what your mix is? And if there's any particular OEMs you're aware have particularly lower mix versus the industry? Alok Maskara : Yeah. I mean, I guess, we have just looked at all the different OEMs and looked at other reports and come with that number. It's -- I wouldn't say it's precisely accurate. It's directionally correct. For our perspective, we make the low end merit products in there. And we have been previously talked about if they are tariffs, we believe about $1 billion of ours. So 20% of our output would be impacted through that. since we make our premium products in U.S., and we also have three residential factories. Commercially, so far, all our production was in U.S. and not in Mexico. So we're just starting on that together. But we do know many of our competitors often sometimes in the same geographical area within Mexico that they manufacture in Mexico as well. So we think the 40% number is about right, obviously more skewed towards residential versus commercial. Jeffrey Hammond : So you'd say today, you're probably below that industry average? Alok Maskara : Yeah. Slightly below, but it depends on which OEM right? For some OEMs, we are significantly below. With some OEMs, we're actually a little bit higher. So it just goes OEM by OEM, yes. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. Great. And then just on this distribution margin focus, can you just level set us on kind of progress over the past year what are some of the big opportunities this year? And do you think you start to move those margins up or is that a longer time frame? Alok Maskara : It is over a long time frame, but some of the results that you see today are based on that initiative as well. So if you think about HCS, we did have a record ROS and you've followed us for a long period of time and that is consistent with us getting more distributor margins. I realize a lot of the incentive changes that we made and the reorganization that we did happen at the end of Q2 in 2024. So I think some of those results are just coming through. But that's a long journey, right? We've talked about manufacturers plus distributor margin is higher than our 2026 targets. So I think that continues beyond 2026. But progress so far gives us the confidence to say that we would be on the high end of our previously published targets for 2026. Jeffrey Hammond : And what your parts and accessories mix today and what do you think entitlement is? Alok Maskara : Hasn't changed much over the past year. I mean we remain at about 20%-ish in parts and accessories. I'm confident my entitlement is twice that much. But we've been talking about that for many years, and I think it's finally time to show some results over the next few months and years. But entitlement remains high and our current volume remains low. Jeffrey Hammond : Great. Thanks, Alok. Operator : We'll go next to Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nicole DeBlase : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Nicole. Nicole DeBlase : A lot of ground has been covered here. But I guess maybe just some cleanups for me. How are you guys thinking about new construction versus replacement demand within HCS for 2025? Michael Quenzer : New construction is about 20% of that segment. We think it's going to be kind of flattish, but the big driver there is going to be if interest rates continue to go down. If it goes down, we think that there's pent-up demand in that space for new home construction that could happen. But there's obviously some labor challenges as well on that side of the industry to making sure they can keep up with the demand. So it's mostly interest rate driven, but kind of flattish within the guide. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. Understood. And then just thinking through kind of the margin dynamics by segments. I know you guys don't give official margin guidance by segment, but is directionally the right way to think about it, maybe HCF could be a bit more challenged year-on-year, given some of the prebuy in 2024. And then BCS should be up. And I guess, is it fair to assume that BCS sees more margin expansion in the second half as some of those new ramp-up costs roll off? Thank you. Michael Quenzer : Yeah. That's correct. Overall, the margin guide is about flat, up in BCS, down in HCS. The larger portion of the $50 million of productivity will be BCS, which is a big driver of that margin expansion. That will kind of happen throughout the year, but the volume gains, the share gains will mostly be kind of in the second half for BCS as that factor ramps up. Nicole DeBlase : Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll pass it on. Michael Quenzer : Yeah. Operator : We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michael Quenzer : Hi, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. I'll echo some of the previous comments you provided some really good calibration on what you think the prebuy was for you guys. And Alok, you expand a bit, you referenced some of your competitors who had stockouts because they switched over earlier. How much of a surprise was that? How tactical were you and how you positioned in the fourth quarter? And could you give us a sense of how the individual months played out? Was it a big like windfall in December or was it level loaded? Alok Maskara : Yeah. First of all, we were not surprised that a competitor had a misstep almost always happens in any of these regulatory transition. But yeah, we were surprised as to which competitor had that misstep. I mean we would have expected somebody else to have it. So from that perspective, there was a bit of a surprise. How it impacted us was like we were fully loaded, and we had really high fill rates throughout. So we were able to capture additional share. And now the whole challenge is to take that share and make it more of a permanent share. And we know that's going to be a challenge, and we bake that in. In Q4, it was fairly even across all three months. And part of it was driven by just anything we could manufacture we were selling. So it was more constrained by manufacturing capacity and where we had different inventory station in our supply chain. Some of the temporary share gain did start in Q3. So I think you think from the share gain that happened. And we remain very optimistic that we'll convert a part of that to more permanent share gain. But tactically, our response was we were selective to make sure that customers that we took on were customers who would stay with us for more permanent and we're not buying from us just during the stock out. So I think we were able to gain some new customers and convert some loyalty from existing customers as well. Deane Dray : Yeah. Let's be clear that that's a high quality problem to have to talk about temporary market share and windfall from a prebuy and a tough comp. So that's -- I appreciate all the calibration. And then the second question, Alok, can you expand on your comment where you said some of your best deals in 2024 were those that you did not do. Was it just a question of price, but I have a hunch, there's probably there was a data center opportunity that you passed on, but any kind of color there would be helpful? Alok Maskara : Sure. Yes. There were data center opportunities that we passed on. There was international expansion opportunities that were passed on. There were some domestic consolidation opportunities that we passed on as well. It all came down to a very disciplined framework. I mean helps having a conservative CFO, to give Michael some credit for this, right? I mean we have ROIC target. We are kind of don't wear rose colored glasses to look at the industry and we feel that often, we can get more share with better execution versus going and buying share through M&A. So I think we were kind of proud of those calls. I was hoping somebody would catch on to my comment. We had a lot of fun with that comment when we were writing the script. Deane Dray : All right. Good. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t let you down, Alok. Thank you. Alok Maskara : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Alok, maybe can you just maybe just dig into the BCS volume guidance for the year, up in mid-single digits. Any way to quantify how much is baked in for the Saltillo ramp-up? And I'm thinking, is it industry flattish and that mid-single digits is all share gain? Anything there would be helpful. Alok Maskara : Yeah. We think there's a little bit of market growth. And remember, we have 3 businesses, the service business, refrigeration and HVAC business. So a little bit of market growth, but about 1 or 2 points of that would be a share gain specifically around emergency replacement. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then just back to 410A. I don't know if you want to sort that your industry hat on, but if you had to have to guess on the excess 410A units shipped in 2024 would that be 1 million or any way to size that? And then just thinking about your inventory levels in 4Q. Obviously, a little bit higher Q-over-Q. I don't know, $25 million, perhaps higher than I would have expected. Is that a good way to think about the 410A inventory held at year-end? Alok Maskara : So first of all, on the previous one, there are lots of industry reports and I will first admit I've no industry expert, but I think the units, our estimate range is from low end of $300 million, high end of $600 million. So it's in that number, not 1 million. So I think it's 0.5 million that we're talking about. So that's a range. And we think it's within that range and nobody has more insight to be more precise within that. On our own internal inventory, I mean, it was a case of two things, right? I mean, commercial, we are building a bit of inventory to get into emergency replacement, you need inventory positioned in the local market. So we are building inventory for commercial, and you will probably see that trend continue in Q1 because Q2 is our peak season. But that's probably driving the variation to your model there. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Alok. Operator : We'll go next to Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead. Damian Karas : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Alok Maskara : Good morning. Damian Karas : I wanted to ask you about the free cash flow guidance. So cash flow obviously came in a good bit better than you had expected in 2024. But the guidance for this year, the range is pretty wide. So could you just maybe spell out the moving pieces there? Michael Quenzer : Yeah. I think if you look at it from a conversion perspective, the midpoint of our free cash flow guide to the midpoint of net income guidance is about 85% conversion. So a little below the compared to the 90% conversion that we've traditionally targeted mostly because of us having to reinvest in inventory, both in BCS and HCS as we depleted some of that as well as the capital expenditures continue to be a little bit higher than depreciation. But we think when we get back into 2026 and beyond, we're going to be well into the 90% again, high end of the range would obviously reflect just better performance on receivables and accounts payable initiatives that I'm leading. Damian Karas : Got it. That's helpful. And then Alok, you talked a little bit before about potential policy implications from tariffs and immigration policy just curious, thinking about the pause on IRA funding, is that something that give you some cause for concern at all? Just thinking about like your 2026 targets and beyond and what that might mean for heat pump penetration, where I know you guys are very confident that you'll be gaining some share in the market? Alok Maskara : Yeah. I mean I think the good news with the IRA pass that was not making a huge difference in our volumes in '24 or '23. We are also waiting for that to come through the states and come back to it. Now the tax part of it is already there, right? So the energy efficiency, rebased on tax, that has not changed. So no, I think the IRA has no whether it was paused or going on, did not have a material impact for us in '24 and not going to have a material impact in '25, even if it's paused. So it's a bit of a no news for us. Damian Karas : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Alok Maskara : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Stephen Tusa : Hey, good morning. Alok Maskara : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : So I just wanted to kind of clarify a couple of things. So are you guys still saying that there was no prebuy in 3Q. You're saying that most like the vast, vast majority came in 4Q? Alok Maskara : Yeah. Yes, that's true, Steve. But also with the caveat that Q3, we did see some share gains, which we were calling the temporary share gain when some of the OEMs were not able to fulfill demand. But yes, otherwise, all of rebuy we expect was in Q4. Stephen Tusa : And then on that share gain, do you think the share gain in 4Q was kind of like commensurate with that rate that you booked into 3Q or was there any difference because I don't think those guys kind of changed it. Maybe they didn't change your strategy a little bit, but do you think like commensurate split between the share in 3Q and 4Q. Alok Maskara : No. I think Q4 was less. They did improve their position and then they launched the 454B and they were aggressive in the marketplace with that. So I think from that perspective, I think share gain was more of a Q3 story. It obviously bled into Q4. But towards the tail end of Q4, I think it was almost all prebuy. Stephen Tusa : Right. So what happened was you guys, they didn't really have a competitive product. You guys shipped a lot of the 410A gained some share. And then when they came with their 454B, those share gains ebbed a bit. Is that kind of the right? Alok Maskara : Yes, slowed down a bit. That's right. Yes. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then on the inflation numbers, the 3%, what is the hard number? Like what's the base on that? Is that like total cost just sales minus profit? Or COGS? Or what is the actual run rate like the actual number on that, the absolute number? Michael Quenzer : The total cost sales minus profit, about $4 billion of cost. Stephen Tusa : Yeah. Okay. That's super helpful. And then sorry, one more. just on Mexico. What is the plan for you guys? Will it be mostly price increases or can you shift some back here if they do go through with some of these things, which I'm not sure that they will. But if they do, will it be mostly price increased or can you ship some stuff back to the U.S? Alok Maskara : So in the short term, besides any impact from peso devaluation and productivity, it will be mostly pricing. On the long term, if it is a long term, then yes, we'll start looking at looking at getting more in Marshalltown, more in Orange Book as some of these factories used to make this product. But to ramp that back up, it will take us some time. Stephen Tusa : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate all the color. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning. Just one more on inventory, if I could, adjust it a little bit. But actually, your inventories relative to sales, right, were a lot lower than normal here in the fourth quarter, right? So obviously, you're blowing out 410A. But if I think about what you said about kind of some commercial inventory build and the fact that inventories look a bit low relative to sales in Q4. It doesn't really jump out to me that you have a lot of 410A left in-house to be pushing into the channel in the first half or the first quarter. Maybe can you just triangulate me on that? And a little bit more color on the position. And maybe a second part of that, too, Michael, sorry, just you did give us kind of the 45-55 revenue split. But I guess my question about inventory is going to you had over-absorption in Q4, obviously, under absorptions likely in Q1. Maybe just a little more color on how to think about the margin trajectory would be helpful. Michael Quenzer : Sure. Yeah. I think it's a good point on the inventory. And what we're seeing is we did have some 410A availability at the end of the year, but a lot of that was pre-bought into Q4. So we'll kind of sell that through early into Q1, it will kind of start to mitigate and be gone -- fully gone by the second quarter. But I think that's really the depletion of that inventory. You're going to start to see going into the first quarter. And then on the absorption side, you're right, we will -- could start to ramp up the new 454B product in the first half of the year, and that should give us access to some more tailwinds in HCS. On the BCS side, though, we're going to have unfavorable comparisons in the first half as we continue to launch that new factory. Second half of the year, you get a lot better productivity from that absorption on BCS. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there. Operator : Thank you for joining us today. Since there are no further questions, this will conclude Lennox's 2024 fourth quarter and full year conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
