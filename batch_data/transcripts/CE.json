Juvekar - Citi Maggie Cheung - Wells Fargo Alex Yefremov - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Laurence Alexander - Jefferies Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global James Sheehan - SunTrust Nils Wallin - CLSA Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Celanese Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Sir, you may begin. Jon Puckett : Thank you, Shannon. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2014 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Steven Sterin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Celanese Corporation first quarter 2014 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire on April 21, 2014 after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section under financial information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then we will field your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Jon, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining the call today. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments brief and then open the line for your questions. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share; which is a record first quarter and one of the top earnings quarters in our history. Sales increased 6% year-over-year and 5.5% sequentially on 3% higher volumes for both periods. Segment income margin increased 260 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%. We generated operating cash flow of $164 million, deployed $53 million of cash this quarter to repurchase about 1 million shares, and end the quarter with about $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, well-positioned to pursue our growth initiatives and maintain our capital deployment strategy. Every business performed at a very high level, expanding margins both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by strong execution, innovative products, and productivity. In Engineered Materials, we introduced new products and applications that met customer needs, driving strong volume growth in auto and medical segments. In Consumer Specialties, a number of initiatives came through helping us lower operating cost and improve operational reliability. In Industrial Specialties, our proprietary technology drove strong demand in Europe and Asia. And in Acetyl Intermediates, the strategic actions taken last year resulted in lower operating cost, while day-to-day execution drove margin improvement. While we are off to a great start for the year, we still have a lot of work ahead of us to deliver on our commitments. For instance, in the second quarter, we have a major turnaround going on at Clear Lake, the largest Acetyls unit in the world. In our cellulose derivatives business, we expect slightly lower earnings due to the timing, impact of our production schedule as we prepare for outages later this year. These two items alone represent headwinds of about $20 million sequentially. But despite hurdles like those mentioned, our ability to execute against our strategy provides line of sight to earnings growth of 12% to 14% for 2014. With that I will now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Mark. In order to get through everybody's question we ask that you limit it to one question and one follow-up and with that Shannon I will turn it over to you for the Q&A instruction. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. You may begin. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Hey Mark, could you quantify the benefit from VAM in Q1 in terms of how much spot you sold and the likely benefit in Q2 from this spike in VAM prices? Mark Rohr : Well, I would like to not break it down just by specific product, but we did see as you know, David, we saw with a number of unscheduled attitudes as well some structural changes happened last year we saw some tightness in the VAM market manifest itself as we ended the quarter. Net-net we had pricing up offset by raw materials probably to the tune of $20 million or something that rolled through relative to quarter. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Very good. And just Mark, just on China. Can you talk about acetic acid pricing as well as the profitability of your acid unit in Nanjing? Mark Rohr : No, I won't talk about specifically, but what I will say is that acid remains, we're stable in China, we've seen some margin increase over the last several quarters; we are trending up in margins in China. Our kind of view is that we should have volume growth, the margin grow slower through the year based on what we're seeing over there. Jon Puckett : Thanks, David. Shannon, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. You may begin. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Mark, I was wondering -- you've talked a little bit about changing strategy and pricing and I think pricing across AI in particular has been better than we would have forecast each of the last two quarters. Can you talk about that new level of either profitability or pricing that you've been able to get structurally changing the way you write your contracts? Mark Rohr : Yes, Duffy. So I think most folks on the call know that if you look back historically we have been a company that in the AI chain was largely fully contracted. And the contract pricing we are all formally driven with a lot of restrictions on -- self-imposed restrictions on how rapidly we can move pricing based on the circumstance that we face. And we look at that in 2012 and really concluded that did not give us the degrees (inaudible) make the kind of decisions you need to make the drive value. And so we started rewriting those contracts and moving away from indexes. We're not completed with that in some businesses we're probably two-thirds of the way they are, in other businesses we're more like half the way they are, Duffy. So what we are doing is we are just putting ourselves to make a conscious decision everyday on how we price these products and so that's what we're doing. We run it day to day to day and because we've been able to make good business commercial decisions and we've seen hyperinflation rolled through and have been able to capture that and be victimized by that and equally when we see opportunities to push in -- into new markets in the areas we're able to respond very quickly to that. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Great. And then it just on the Clear Lake turn around, it is a relatively new unit, kind of the one that got punctured or whatever four or five years ago. Would you be able to expand the capacity in that unit in this turnaround? Mark Rohr : Not directly. Duffy, well that unit is now -- that's the last expansion we did the largest acetyl chain in the world. And what we're doing though is we're expecting to be able to run longer between turnarounds because of the some of the steps we're taking. So incrementally we will instead of going down every other year we will make sure we try to go down every third to fourth year. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Perfect. Thank you. Mark Rohr : That will give us some capacity. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks, Duffy. Shannon, let's move on to the next. Operator : Our next question is from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : So with regard to the consumer business, clearly it enjoyed a lot of lift and you gave some -- or you put out some statements regarding there were a number of kind of initiatives that were finally starting to kick in. Can you walk us through kind of what some of the major initiatives were that really moved the needle because it clearly was a pretty big pick up there? Steven Sterin : Hi, John, it's Steven. First of all if you look at the top-line in terms of what's common there, we talked about our ability to continue to add value in this space and recognize higher pricing in our tow business. You will see that this was offset by the step-down in a contract like arrangement. So you've seen growth coming from the top-line. In terms of the productivity we've also been able to do some things with our raw material usages and approaches there that have yielded us some meaningful productivity. And finally we had talked to you before about building a natural gas pipeline down in Mexico to give us off of crude base derivative for our energy and steam. We've completed that project as well. So when you look at those in combination a really strong performance. I would note that in Q1 if you look at Q1 versus the outgoing quarters I think we did about 128 or so in the first quarter I would expect that to be more in the 150 to 120 range as we move out. We're going to have a turnaround in one of our major units and also you have the corresponding build to draw inventory associated with that. But that's in that $15 million to $20 million headwind that Mark talked about. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : And then just as the follow-up. I know there has been some excess capacity put in place on the cellulosic fiber side. Have you seen the benefit of that on the raw materials yet? Is that part of some of the benefits that you have started to see yet or is that something still going to come for you? Steven Sterin : If you look at the headline prices for cellulosic, it is down which is probably an industry wide impact. So yes there is some benefit from that that is out there but that's not a large part of what I just talked about. Mark Rohr : And that's specific to the raws as well. Steven Sterin : Right. Mark Rohr : Right, yes. Jon Puckett : Thanks, John. Let's move to next question Shannon. Operator : Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. You may begin. P.J. Juvekar - Citi: Mark, the European recovery should be benefiting the AEM business. So can you just talk about geographically what are the margins in Europe? How much did they improve? And how would they compare sort of to North America? Mark Rohr : Yes, in that business the margins are virtually identical on either side of the Atlantic, P.J. There is no -- I mean there is certainly differences in one product and in one application broadly speaking, they are about the same. What we are seeing in Europe is pretty strong. Auto build activity over there, I think year-over-year we are up 4.7% globally. In Europe it's about 4.6% of that or so with Germany about 7%, if my memory serves me. So we've seen a really strong pull there and we continue to expand the applications of our product. So we're seeing some real strong uptick in volume per vehicle and that's really pushing a lot of or pulling a lot of material for us. But we're also seeing in areas like medical do quite well, some industrial applications that have been a bit weaker, starting to pick up again. So generally Europe is doing much better P.J. than it was this time last year and now. And I think you would have seen us have a pretty good year there. P.J. Juvekar - Citi: And secondly on methanol, your first plant is being built with a joint venture partner, now you are working on a second plant. So why bring the joint venture partner on the first plant, why not just build it yourself? Thank you. Mark Rohr : Yes, JV I think -- these things are sequential, so we needed to get started in a hurry. And there was a limit to how committed we wanted to be to one single project, for methanol and so we did that and we got started with that project. And you saw the amount of time it took for us to get the permit complete, which has put us a bit in a bind as we try to get this operational next year. At the time we looked also at Bishop and Bishop was certainly very doable roughly the same economics. But it represented some different challenges for us that we wanted some time to sort through. And we sorted through those challenges, so we're now starting the permit process there. I think our construction of that project is going to be dependent on our attracting a suitable partner or partners to let us end up in balance on methanol consumption versus demand. Jon Puckett : Thanks, P.J. Shannon, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. You may begin. Maggie Cheung - Wells Fargo : Hi, this is actually Maggie on for Frank. Mark Rohr : Hi, Maggie. Maggie Cheung - Wells Fargo : Hi. So in consumer specialties you had mentioned that the higher pricing in tow was offset by the legacy contract in flake. So would you be able to size that offset and how long will this contract last for? Mark Rohr : That contract goes to 2017. I think through 2017 and the pricing is not constant. So it's a bit tougher on this year than it will be in the outline years Maggie and I prefer not doing actual the numerical offset there but net-net I think we're up few percent on prices that is reflected in the numbers. Maggie Cheung - Wells Fargo : And then Celanese has a pretty healthy balance sheet and you've been spending a lot in terms of internal growth projects. What are your thoughts on M&A at this time? Mark Rohr : Well, we're working as hard Maggie, it's hard to buy things these days, but your prices are very high and people tend to be reluctant to sell the kind of properties they we want to buy, but nonetheless we are working very hard on that. We have been building out our M&A team and I'm real pleased with that group now. So what I will just say is stay tuned, we're going to work hard to try to find some good properties to add to our portfolio, but anything we do there Maggie will make sense to you guys. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Maggie. Shannon, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Alex Yefremov - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : : Mark Rohr : Well, what I was referring to Alex is if you look back over the last decade that business hasn't really contributed a meaningful way to the acetyl chain for anybody associated with it. And we were sitting and I'll quote a number that's directionally right with capacity utilization of 60-some-percent arena. So we're very low and we in turn had a couple of sites in Europe that were stranded assets excellent people great sites but a lot of regard but in a situation where logistically I think from a size point of view they just couldn't -- they just couldn't make any money. So we took steps to sell and then ended up shutting down we see on Tarragona. At the same time any shutdown of a cracker, I mean a VAM plant out in the UK. The net effect of that probably was a 5% or 6%; I'm looking at my colleagues' capacity elimination right. So in theory you haven't really changed the dynamics very much in a world market. But what it did is it took what was a pretty sloppy Europe and made Europe pretty tight. So Europe is now a net importer of VAM. U.S. is pretty tight we've seen some demand growth in U.S., we've seen demand growth in Europe and in Asia. So we got into a trade imbalance challenge that is driven pricing short-term. It will some period of time for that to work itself out. My gut feel though is that we're seeing margins in that business like we're seeing margins in AI in general slowly expend and get to a healthier level. So I wouldn't expect that business to be the best business is in our portfolio any time soon but I think it's going to a better business for us as we go out through this year and into next year than it has been historically. Alex Yefremov - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. And then moving to AEM, the volumes were up 14%, do you think this kind of growth is sustainable on a year-over-year basis or may be this quarter was particularly good for whatever reason? Mark Rohr : Yes, if you look at Engineered Materials we've got strong sales increase, strong volume increase that 13%, 14% kind of percent. A lot of it has been driven by -- although we are -- the own goal we have internally is to sell 2X kind of the growth in that business and we've been able to do that. So when you look at we're expecting year-over-year auto builds to be may be 3%, 2.8% or something for the full year forecasted growth. That would say we need to grow 6% or 7% or 8% that's kind of the numbers that we kind of target. When you get beyond although the new applications we're introducing are starting to have traction. And it is always a point of caution Alex, to introduce new things because we will expect big revenue on day one and you just don't get that. But when you go out and demonstrate new way to support and insulate high voltage power lines and have 10 kilometer high-voltage line in place. And in South Texas, you start making a difference. And so we're excited about our ability to grow this business and we think it should be a multiple GDP kind of growth business. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Alex. Shannon, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : Mark, I was wondering if you could talk about what the hurdles are as you bring up the Clear Lake methanol plant. You mentioned a third quarter 2015 start up, but trying to accelerate it. What are going to be the biggest roadblocks to getting that done faster? Mark Rohr : Hi, Bob, we're just doing a lot of work in a short period of time. If you look at the chart, we sort of gave you see how steep that project completion start is. We have a number of months. I think five months we have for about 10% completion on average across these five months. Those will spend the end of this year and early next year, so October through to like February kind of timeframe, which is also a bad time of the year. Bob, so we can be very susceptible to weather and events kind of out of our control. So we're trying to just start really strong. We're actually doubling shifts down there now as we speak to try to start making some inroads on the schedule early in the year to give us a little bit (inaudible) later on. We need to do that to have a chance of pulling this thing back. But right now, I think the schedule we put out there, which is the September/October kind of timeline is fully consistent with the numbers that we gave last quarter in terms of the range and the kind of headwinds we face. And we're just going to do all we can to pull it up and we will keep you posted on our success with that. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : And if I might ask a couple of raw material questions. One of your fellow methanol producers struck a natural gas contract, which appears to be based on a shared margin arrangement. Is there any chance you could do that at either Clear Lake or Bishop? And then also in the U.S. you guys used to have a favorable ethylene contract. Is that still there? And when might it expire if it is? Mark Rohr : Yes, most of our ethylene and much of which ethylene contracts -- most of our ethylene contracts roll off in '15. And we are starting some early negotiations on a few of those, so I'm not sure exactly which one you're talking with -- you're talking about now. Steven Sterin : May be thinking back to a contract we had in the mid-2005 that had a kind of virtual cracker type arrangements into it. Those -- that contract got wiped out in an industry bankruptcy so that -- we don't have that type of contracts any more. So I think the contracts Mark is talking about would be -- really kind of continuous market rollover type contracts we will be negotiating. Mark Rohr : So as it relates to the net gas and we've looked at what Methanex did and I think that made sense to that and we don't think that kind of contract relation will make sense to us. One of the interesting things about the gas market now is futures markets don't move very much even though with the tightness of increased consumption after this winter. So we're exploring options to buy forward some gas to run that unit. And as we get into looking at doing that, if we do that we will certainly make sure that with you guys going forward. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : And, Mark, I know you would rather not talk about acetic and methanol. So let me ask you an AEM question. You guys, I would assume, have pretty long lead times in developmental work. From where you stand is the electric car revolution really going to occur? Are you doing a lot of work on those kind of applications beyond just sort of the standard light weighting that has been going on to make CAFE standards? Is there more in the pipeline that we don't see from the outside? Mark Rohr : Well, yes Bob it just a bit -- I don't know if I'm -- one of the forecast was working on board. I tell you is that light weighting is a precursor, prerequisite for that to happen and the amount of energy left in light weighting is just staggering, it's things beyond the conventional use of thermoplastic to thermostats. We are seeing a lot of work on electronics phase to sort of eliminate dashboards and things like that and go to these normal to flat panel display for our vehicles. So you can start to imagine ways that you can get the weight, weight way down these vehicles and that makes the -- some of lithium ion technology really viable for electric cars to work. So my gut is that it's going to be -- it's a little bit like the energy business. There's going to be lot of different solutions. But what we're going to play there a lot is going to be in the light weighting, strengthening and thermoplastics are just killer in that regard because they are relatively inexpensive versus acetic carbon and it provides virtually the same characteristics. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Bob. Shannon, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. You may begin. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: I guess two longer-term questions. First, on the Consumer Specialties segment, as you think about the longer-term trend for acetate tow demand to be able to sustain your kind of earnings CAGR longer-term do you need to start to see competitor shutting down capacity or do you expect demand to keep growing through the end of the decade? Mark Rohr : No, I don't think there is, I think the industry is kind of perspective on demand, is that we're pretty close to the top on demand and demand is going to start sliding down. I think I've told you, I don't think that really matters as long as the industry kind of makes rationale decisions with regard to the capacity. We certainly have taken steps to shut down and idle and our -- our ineffective units and in case we're doing that we actually gave out volume. So I think we saw a way to do that it made economic sense for us. I'll be kind of shocked if others independently don't have the same kind of opportunities in front of them. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies: And then secondly on the light weighting side, do you think there will be a point where the benefit for Celanese flattens out in the sense that as things move towards virtual dashboards, and so on, you just end up taking out more pieces of the car and that offsets the incremental light weighting opportunity for you? Mark Rohr : Well, yes. It's just not absolute. The -- we're only from a penetration point of view even though we had a good uptick this quarter we're still a few kilograms per vehicle in the world and we see a range and they are from 0 to 8, 9, or 10. So, I think -- I think there is still so much upside there it's hard for me to see Laurence a near-term follow-up to that and what we're finding is that the desire to continue to substitute is really great, so just like steel is facing aluminum and aluminum is facing carbon. They're also facing thermoplastics like I commented on and there's just a lot of run there. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Laurence. Shannon, let's move to the next. Operator : Our next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : It sounds like from the release that you've got 80% of your cost all set there at Clear Lake, but on the Bishop facility how confident are you in the CapEx number you put out there just given all the inflation that others are seeing and that you are kind of had a bunch of other projects in that area or just in general ahead of you? Mark Rohr : I think that's a big question on Bishop. If you look at the design and the basis on a relative basis it is virtually the same stock cost if you think will have at Clear Lake. Having said that you come up building this thing at a time when everybody and their brother is building a chemical plant on U.S. Gulf Coast. So there is going to be inflation and to be honest we haven't really quantified that yet. The good news about the permitting process is that we have a little bit of time to do that as we work with partners and the permitting will not be finished with this actually until our other plant is up and running. So I think we will have a good chance of nailing that -- nailing that cost and being very transparent with that at the time. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : And as a follow-up, is it a reasonable assumption on our end that sort of the move to JV at Clear Lake and now maybe to do Bishop as a JV as well or just to do it at all is because you have freed up capital that should -- you sort of at one point I thought was going to go towards TCX and now that that's not moving as fast as you thought, you are just reallocating it? Mark Rohr : No, I look at a bit differently. I think we're quite confident in our ability to build these demand and we're quite confident in the long-term competitive position in natural gas in U.S. So we think U.S. based methanol is going to be one of the most cost effective methnols in the world, certainly in developed world, it will be the most cost effective. We have a sink for a million tons and we've satisfied about two-thirds of that, a little more than two-thirds of that. And so we're exploring is can we satisfy the other third, which would represent economic advantage to us in our Engineered Materials business. So no, I think I would look at that way. I think it's just we gain confidence. We feel good about our cash flow going forward and we're willing to put it out there. But I want to emphasize we will need a partner; we have no interest in building the plant by ourselves. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Vincent. Let's move to the next Shannon. Mark Rohr : Vincent. Jon Puckett : Hang on. Steve Sterin : You know you had a question embedded in there about TCX as well and let me give you just a quick update on where we're with that. Mark Rohr : Well, you want to say a couple of things. Steve Sterin : Yes, I think in Indonesia we're making nice progress there in terms of identifying land, we see a partial land we're interested in and the process is moving forward, but it's going to take a little bit more time, but we're making on more progress there. In China, we are in the days now we're actually engine testing and with our product and moving forward on that. So those are kind of the securities update from our last call. Jon Puckett : Okay. Shannon, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. You may begin. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Decent margin expansion on the AI side of things in the quarter. Just trying to get a sense -- obviously it was a bit of a noisy quarter in terms of outages and higher methanol prices and the like. Obviously since then, methanol prices have rolled over. Just trying to get a sense that -- are these sort of Q1 margin levels in AI sustainable over the next couple of quarters? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think so. I mean there will be ups and downs. We are most concerned about the outages in Clear Lake because not only are we going down for a long period of time, but our some of our supplies of raw materials are going down. So we have kind of baked in a fairly low operating utilization for this quarter there and that could have been impact, if, I think it will be okay but it's one of our suppliers does not get back upon time. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Fair enough. Mark Rohr : I think what you're seeing is, you see in the industry slowly, I won't say reset, and Lord knows these margins are moving out dramatically, but we're seeing margins kind of move towards the point of greater sustainability. I think there is an interest -- there is an interest for that to happen. What I see in the world is people just making a little better decision. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Now a follow-up on the methanol side of things. Just curious about your views of the market near to medium term. A fair bit of capacity coming online be it Methanex or CIP. You obviously mentioned that you are very sort of confident and comfortable with the cost position within the U.S. But just in terms of supply/demand fundamentals over the next couple of years with all of this capacity coming online, are you in the camp that you expect call it effective utilization rates to remain tight for the next couple of years? Mark Rohr : Well I think it's others business to comment on the better than I can, but what I'll say is that we think we've seen prices fall down, pull back in China and move back to a more reasonable range in the $400 kind of range, I would expect that at some point the prices in the U.S. will move off where they are today in fact back closer to $500 or so. And my kind of gut is that's a place that it's going to be haunt for a while and then we will bring on some existing plants and we'll see what happens, but I think for the next couple of years methanol is pretty close to where it's going to be. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : And essentially you are saying that most of this new capacity that is expected to come online, demand is strong enough to digest this incremental supply? Mark Rohr : I think so, yes. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Hassan. Shannon, let's do the next question. Operator : And our next question is from James Sheehan of SunTrust. You may begin. James Sheehan - SunTrust: Hi, Mark. What makes you comfortable that you can offset the negative impact of shifting towards internally produced methanol in late 2015? Mark Rohr : Well you don't get a chance to interact with team I have here every day. If you did we'd do it. We were looking at it every day and we're just stacking up the things that we need to do to offset it. And later this year we will share those things with you. And so it's not really -- we're too early in this year to worry about to be honest but or I'd share more. But we have -- I have confidence; just that we have confidence that we will find a way to offset that. And that's our objective and Steven Sterin's office furniture is for sale right now. So whatever excites. James Sheehan - SunTrust: Also on emulsion polymers, you noted that there were some beneficial effects in Europe and part of that may have been driven by the weather. I'm just wondering if you can comment on the sustainability on strength you're seeing in that business? Mark Rohr : Yes, Europe is all paints and curly and that business is strong. I think it's a good news this year and you recall that the weather was a welcome surprise for us early in the year. We had a pretty wet start to 2013; it's a bit slow this year. Weather was much nicer and people jumped projects early. We don't see it winding. Actually there's a lot of construction underway in Europe if you get out and about there you'll see it gives you pretty good confidence that we're going to see Europe remain strong. I'd say the same thing for Asia. And that business has been very strong and we don't see any signs that's letting up, but we're less confident of is the U.S., which is not train wreck or anything, but it's just kind of muddling along. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks, Jim. Let's move, Shannon, to the next question and we'll have Nils be the final set of question. Operator : Our final question is from Nils Wallin of CLSA. You may begin. Nils Wallin - CLSA: Back on the Bishop plant since it is going to be similar scale as Clear Lake, but Clear Lake will account for about two-thirds of your current methanol needs. Does this mean that there's going to be a different JV structure or will you -- are you planning to actually grow into that methanol capacity in terms of downstream derivative growth? Mark Rohr : No, we would like to differentiate the structure. We'd like to be a minority consumer as a structure. And do we need more growth? We could have more growth there and stuff but I wouldn't build an ethanol plant to satisfy. So I think you should expect this to be a minority investment. Nils Wallin - CLSA: And just back on industrial ethanol in China, obviously for a while it disconnected with the fuel ethanol and that kind of prevented the retrofit from having any meaningful earnings contribution. Has anything changed on the industrial ethanol pricing and there is any opportunity for Nanjing retrofit to start adding to earnings? Mark Rohr : No, I wish I could say there was. Right now that the industrial and you saw the market for ethanol remains quite weak in China. We're occasionally moving some material offshore getting a bit higher net back on that. But it's helping to see our way clear for that unit to be a material contributor certainly this year. Jon Puckett : Thanks Nils and thanks everybody else for your time and interest in Celanese. We will be around later today for calls. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thanks for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Puckett : Thanks Laura. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation second quarter 2014 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President, Finance. The Celanese Corporation second quarter 2014 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our web site, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then we will field your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks John and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with the earnings, so I will keep my comments brief, then open the line for your questions. We had a really strong quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.47, that's the highest in our history. Sales increased 7% year-over-year, 4% sequentially on pricing that was 6% higher than last year and 4% higher than last quarter. Segment income margin expanded 18.6%, that's a 260 basis point increase year-over-year and a 90 basis point sequential increase. In Engineered Materials, we delivered record revenue and segment income with strong demand across auto, consumer and industrial applications. Consumer Specialties' segment income was impacted by a third party power outage, interrupted operations at our cellulose derivatives facility in Narrows, Virginia. In Industrial Specialties, growth was driven by improvements in EVA polymers and the growing success of our environmentally friendly technology in emulsion polymers. Acetyl intermediates drove expanded margins through our commercial efforts in acetic acid and structural changes in VAM. Planned and unplanned VAM outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast also contributed this quarter. Cash flow generation was also strong with $253 million of operating cash flow. We deployed $50 million to repurchase about 800,000 shares and entered the quarter with a cash balance of $1.1 billion. We had great results in the first half of the year, which gives me confidence we are going to end the year having grown adjusted earnings in the range of 15% to 17%. This performance lets us shift our focus to developing the Celanese specific initiatives that can help offset the methanol headwinds of about $100 million expected in 2015. We are working on structural actions, like rearranging some of our debt, and opportunities in productivity and tax as a start. We plan to provide you with more clarity as we go through this year, but at this stage I am reasonably confident we can find ways to offset most of the methanol headwind. With that, I will now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett : Thanks Mark. I'd like to just ask everybody to keep your questions to one with one follow-up, and with that I will turn it over to Laura. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And our first question is from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning David. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Mark, given the strong results this year in AI, do you think you can grow earnings, EPS in 2015 versus 2014? Mark Rohr : Yeah I think so David. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Very good. And just to think about consumer, do you get back the hit you took because of the outage? Do you get that back, in the back half of the year? Mark Rohr : Yes we should. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : And just lastly, looking at AEM second half profitability, how do you see that trending versus the first half of the year? Mark Rohr : Well I think where we are right now, that trend is continuing. But classically, in the fourth quarter, that business falls off pretty sharply. So what I would say is that you've had really good performance in the first two quarters, I think that will continue into this quarter and I expect the fourth quarter to drop off in a more seasonal norm. David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank : Thank you very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks David. Laura let's move to the next question. Operator : Okay. Our next question will come from Robert Walker of Jefferies. Robert Walker - Jefferies: Good morning. Thank you. Besides the methanol headwind in 2015, how should we think about the benefit from outages this year in AI and in terms of how much they should repeat or not, and do you think that's another headwind? Mark Rohr : Well there is a portion of it that won't repeat, and we have kind of racked our brain to try to quantify that. I wish I could give you a perfect answer. What we saw is, we saw, maybe $20 million or so last quarter, this quarter, I don't know, maybe about the same number that is kind of between the structural changes and a bit of the trade flowing balances [culled] [ph] some inflation in pricing. So I don't know what that number exactly is, but there are some numbers that represent a bit of a headwind there. Having said that, we have had some major outages this year that won't be repeated next year, that will offset a part of it. So what my intent is Robert, as we go through the next two earnings calls, I'd be very specific about laying out exactly what's before us, and exactly how we are going to grow this company through selling methanol and grow our earnings next year. Robert Walker - Jefferies: All right. Thanks. And then -- understand there is more detail coming at some point, but in terms of the measures you're using to offset the headwind, your tax rate is already one of the lowest in the group, and I guess I am wondering what you can do there, and in terms of the debt, does that encompass kind of flexing the balance sheet for buying it back more aggressively, or is there another lever of buybacks to help EPS growth? Mark Rohr : Yeah, I will let Chris talk about the balance sheet and some of the thoughts he has on the capital restructure. What I will say about tax -- I don't want to get in too much detail about tax. We think we have a little bit of opportunity there that we will share with you later this year. Chris, do you want to share some information on our capital structure? Christopher Jensen : Sure on the balance sheet, some of what we have said before -- when we are generating excess cash and this year is going to be a great year for good strong cash flow, there are different things that we can do with that, and our views haven't changed on that. Now you can look at the balance sheet and see that we have a couple of pieces of debt that we can address, so we have a revolver, that comes due in a year or so, and we have our most expensive bond that becomes callable here in October. So those are the key items in particular we are taking a look at, and I guess what I'd tell you that we are trying to balance, as we monitor these markets and figure out specifically what we will do, is the desire to take advantage of the interest rates that are available to us right now, but also making sure that we continue to maintain the nice flexibility that we have in the nature of the debt that we have. And finally, we constantly keep our eyes on having appropriate maturities coming out into the future, in terms of the timing of debt maturities. Robert Walker - Jefferies: Okay, thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Rob. Laura, let's go to the next question. Operator : Okay. The next question is from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So a question with regard to VAM, obviously things are tight now for some structural reasons with some closures and some with temporary outages. I guess, can you give us your thoughts in terms of where we are on kind of a true supply-demand or operating rate kind of level, if you kind of back out the temporary outages? Mark Rohr : Let me give a shot at that John. So this is an industry that has been running and still runs with, on a global basis, excess capacity, and it\u2019s a business also that -- my personal view is, is not return the cost of capital for a long period of time. So all those things kind of came together with companies like Celanese, a few of us independently shutting down, what were the least profitable assets and what was generally very poor profitable market. The impact of that on a global capacity basis was maybe 6%, 5% or 6% capacity removed. So I don't know if that put us above 70 or not, but you are just still thinking we are probably around 70% capacity utilization. The short term outages, and these are short term outages, made on a short term basis, taking 10% of capacity off the market. So maybe that got us on a short term basis to press past 70 of capacity utilization. So there is not a shortage of VAM globally on one hand. On the other hand, I think that this is an industry that has been plagued with tremendous, I don't know want to say, poor operating efficiency, in part because of its low levels of profitability. So I think in my own mind, we are seeing some reset of the value of VAM, and what I can't quantify exactly what that reset is, but I think it\u2019s naturally going on around the world as this industry indirectly tries to get to a point where it starts return on capital. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, your earnings -- they are certainly benefiting from these VAM outages and maybe some trends that we are seeing in acetic and methanol right now. At the same time, I know your goal over time has been to kind of generate strong, stable, steady earnings growth, and the steady part I guess is the part that seems a little bit in question, just given the huge tailwinds that you're seeing now, but also can become headwinds. So I guess I am wondering, are there things you can do going forward to moderate some of the volatility, both positive and negative, but moderate the volatility going forward, to really lock Celanese into a more stable kind of earnings growth trajectory? Mark Rohr : If you look at -- if you take out kind of those numbers I quoted, VAM, you will see that we are growing our base level profitability in that double digit range on a year-over-year basis. And so I think the formula we have put in place to really push out and diversify our product mix, really bring intrinsic value to our customers and of course get compensated for that, combined with on the technology side, directly to marketing everyday, the products we have in our portfolio, to make sure we are extracting value. That formula is working, and that formula is working to the tune of getting this north of that 10% level that we have talked about so much, maybe in the low teens, but 10% to 12% compounded growth. So I think that is there. As this company grows, there is going to be a natural moderation of volatility from things like a VAM outage, or an outage of cellulose acetate, if I can use those as kind of two examples. That will naturally occur, John, but right now I think to be honest, absent the little bit of aberration in VAM, you are seeing that reduced volatility in our earnings. And with that, it\u2019s kind of the improved predictability of earnings. John McNulty - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks very much for the color. Jon Puckett : Thanks John. Laura, let's move to the next. Operator : The next question is from PJ Juvekar of Citi. Eric Petrie - Citigroup: Good morning. This is Eric Petrie in for PJ. Mark, your second quarter EPS bid [ph] was $0.23 or 5% of 2013 earnings, but the incremental raise for full year was only 3%. So what segments going into second half are you more conservative on? Mark Rohr : Eric, I am sorry, would you just repeat again, I kind of missed that a little bit. Eric Petrie - Citigroup: So second quarter EPS bid [ph] was about $0.23 versus consensus of 5% of 2013 earnings, but your incremental raise for the full year was only 3%. So what segments are you more conservative on, going into the second half? Mark Rohr : What I am trying to convey in that message, is a few things. First is, I work hard not to give you specific guidance. We tried to indicate from a directional point of view what's happening there. So the numbers that were out there in the Street had for last quarter, weren't really our numbers there, numbers that you got calculated. Corporately, what we are saying is that, we expect the third quarter to be pretty similar to this quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be pretty similar to what's a normal average for us, which is a pretty darn weak quarter, and that's how we do the mental math on that. So I think year-over-year, first half to second half, if you do that math, you will see that second half is a little bit less than the first half. And it all boils down to uncertainty we have about the fourth quarter. Eric Petrie - Citigroup: Okay. Thanks. And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you did some contract renegotiations in acetic acid, primarily China, how fast are you now able to pass on higher raw materials, and then what percent of overall contracts have been renegotiated on these terms? Mark Rohr : We are pricing on some cases on a daily basis, so we are making incrementally conscious decisions about whether we sell or don't sell increments in the marketplace. So we have gotten as real time as you could get with that. In terms of the percentage contracts that have been changed, I'd say -- we are probably half on acid and probably a little bit -- I'd say maybe half. Eric Petrie - Citigroup: On both acid and VAM? Mark Rohr : Yeah. I am giving you -- you take that with a [bigger bout] [ph]. I don't know exactly the true numbers. But we started the process, we haven't completed the process, and we have still got good ways to go, and of course we\u2019re working individually with customers, and we will do this year, next year, and the year after that, as these things roll off. Eric Petrie - Citigroup: Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thanks Eric. Jon Puckett : Thanks Eric. Laura, let's move to the next. Operator : Our next question will come from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Good morning guys. Mark Rohr : Good morning Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Just on the EVA side of things, there was a push that started probably two years ago, because it had an ethylene backbone, had a better cost structure then, some of the other things like SB latex that were coming off of a different molecule. How has in general that push to take market share from other backbone chemical has been going for EVA? Mark Rohr : Well it depends on where you are in the world. It has been pretty successful in Asia, Duffy. It has been maybe less successful in the U.S., kind of [indiscernible]. We have seen a lot of inflation in ethylene in the U.S., and probably less movement, north movement certainly butadiene. So I think it has been, I would say, okay in Asia, where most of the capacity has come on, and probably not very much in U.S. and Europe. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: And then, just on the sweetener business, there have been a number of articles recently about diet sodas and stuff not working -- at least not allowing folks to lose weight like we once thought. What are you seeing from an end market demand standpoint? I know you're trying to get away from say drinks and then there is bakery and stuff like that. When you look at the different buckets of demand for the sweetener business, how do you think that's playing out this year? Mark Rohr : Well, we are seeing good receptivity to our movement into servicing more of the French producers or the emerging producers, particularly in Asia and Southeast Asia. Clearly our market -- historical market has been, as you know Duffy, has been carbonated beverages has been the big sink for [SK] [ph], particularly in U.S. and Europe. So there has been some downward pressure that we have experienced over the last couple of years. I think that trend is probably -- I won\u2019t say it\u2019s going to continue, but it seems to be moderating just a little bit. So really the success this business is going to require is to push in a different market, and we are having some success, well that remains to be seen if we can get kind of the growth rate we'd like to see out of these molecules. Duffy Fischer - Barclays: Great. Thanks guys. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks Duffy. Laura, let's move to the next? Operator : Our next question is from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : Hey, good morning gentlemen. Mark Rohr : Good morning Frank. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : Hey it seems to me that there is issues with sweeteners and not being able to lose weight, that would probably move people to smoke more, which might actually help on the Consumer Specialty side. Just a thought. Mark Rohr : I agree with you Frank. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : Looking at AI, you did $146 million, you suffered a $10 million headwind from the plant turnaround, so call it $156 million kind of normalized, what have you. But you did mention about $20 million of an impact from the pricing issues or so. So call it a 135 base something like that for Q2 heading into Q3, yet your guidance is suggesting about $115 million for Q3 and Q4. Can you help explain why we would see that much of a delta? Mark Rohr : Well I think -- I don't know exactly how you work into that math. I am looking at it from a total corporation point of view, and to look from a total corporate point of view, I don't know if it will end up at $146 million next quarter, that'd be too much of a prediction. But what I will say is that the fundamentals today, when I look just at the sales forecast, I look at the net back, we are running at about that rate, maybe a little bit south of that, as we go through this quarter. So I think you should expect us to be in the general range of where we were in this quarter, I mean the last quarter. When I look at the fourth quarter though, when you work through that, we had a record fourth quarter last year, which I believe was $1.03 or something. That was an all time, never before done. People don't even want to talk about it -- kind of the number. So I am very conscious to the fact, that if you look at the motions -- in the motions area, the Engineered Materials there, you look at some of the seasonality we have seen historically and Industrial Chemicals that we could see a pretty good pull back just naturally, as we go through the end of this quarter, and go through the end of this year. So part of what you will hear me communicate is that uncertainty relative to that last quarter. That's how we got those numbers. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : All right. That's very helpful. Then you mentioned in the script, that you expect the share buybacks to moderate from here. Obviously the balance sheet is actually in a better situation. Can you talk about that use of cash? Mark Rohr : Yeah, so we said in motion, the sort of annual objective of doing at least $150 million per year share buyback, that's what we did last year, and certainly through the first half of the year, we are a little over $100 million, is that right Chris? Christopher Jensen : Yes. Mark Rohr : Right now, what we are communicating, let's say, we are going to slow that just a little bit, as we go through this recapitalization kind of debate and discussion. And as we get that done, we will share with you, kind of the pace that we are on. So you should expect the second half of the year, maybe a little bit less than the first half. When you go beyond that, we saw a good bit of cash on the balance sheet. Chris has his eyes on some of that for the recapitalization. We are very active in the M&A arena, and are looking hard to find ways so that we can supplement our portfolio in a very constructive fashion. So hopefully as we get at the end of this year, you will see some of that, and hear about some of those things. Frank Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities : Terrific. Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks Frank. Let's move on to the next. Operator : And our next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Good morning gentlemen. Couple of questions on methanol. First, would you update us on your latest thoughts on the possible expansion at Bishop, Texas? And then second, with regard to your headwind linked to the procurement contract expiration, curious as to why you have not adjusted that downward? It seems like methanol prices have declined quite dramatically over the last six months. Are you being conservative there, or are there perhaps other offsets I am not aware of? Mark Rohr : Yeah Kevin. So regarding Bishop, that permitting process is underway, and I am looking at Gjon Nivica, our General Counsel there. Have any of the permits actually been filed, do you have -- its very close to the filing aspect of the permit. So Kevin, we are continuing to work that, we are negotiating with a number of folks that will try to get to a shortlist here in the fall, and we will keep reporting on that project, on how that project is developing. Regarding the methanol headwinds, we did arrange calculations there, and I think we used $4 to $5 a MMBTU per natural gas, and methanol was $500 to $600 a ton. So yeah you could argue, maybe we are down a little bit on methanol in that, but that was a range of $75 million to $125 million to $130 million. So where we are today, Kevin, its impossible to be any better than say about 100. Of course, which day you start up is worth, I don't know, $750,000 or whatever a day. But it\u2019s a big number per day, may be $500,000 a day. So there is the big numbers there based on the schedule as well, and we are just doing our best to try to be frank about the volatility that -- not volatility, but the ambiguity we have about the exact number. Our plan is to go find $100 million to offset that and we are working like crazy to do it. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. That's really helpful. And then second question Mark, I think you made a comment that M&A in your case is quite active. Obviously you have seen tremendous activity across the chemicals industry in terms of lots of companies pursuing large divestitures, spin-offs, large acquisitions. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that in general, as it relates to the industry, but in particular for Celanese, what sort of opportunities might you see for your own portfolio? Mark Rohr : Yes. I mean, there has been a lot of activity. That activity has all been, from what I can tell, pretty thoughtful. In other words, it has all been focused on driving greater shareholder value. So we have met with a number of those firms. I will say that Kevin, they really talked through their thought process relative to how they think about opportunities for all those different scenarios that you mentioned. So at Celanese, we are all about driving and trying to create shareholder value, and for us, the portfolio connectivity now is a source of tremendous value for us, and value for our shareholders. And so, we are continuing to work it in that fashion. So going forward, from an M&A point of view, we are looking for ways that we extend the reach of our -- either our technology based kind of businesses, or our customer solutions kind of businesses. We are very interested in the materials space and expanding out in that, everything from biopolymers and cellulosics through to composites, particularly in aerospace and automotive, that's areas that are really emerging areas for us and are really attractive. I think some of the derivatives around [indiscernible] chemistry are also pretty much of interest to us, and we are working hard in that area as well. Well nothing specific to report to you today, but I can say, I got my best team on it, and they are working like crazy with the commercial leaders, to find really good opportunities for our shareholders. Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fantastic. I appreciate the thoughts. Jon Puckett : Thanks Kevin. Laura, let's move to the next. Operator : Next we have Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Mark I was wondering if you could talk on AI, give us some sense of how much your profit improvement there was a reflection of the tighter industry, and how much of it was rejiggering of this contract? Mark Rohr : Well Bob, I think -- I will throw out the $20 million number this quarter, and I am not trying to be flipping with that. It\u2019s the hard calculus to do specifically in there, and only history will give you the exact number, but that's what we think. This quarter was probably the direct result of the tightening of the industry. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : And the issues in your flake contract, can you talk about the basis or the context of that contract, and then when that might go away, or the path that it goes away? Mark Rohr : Yeah. We have a legacy contract on flake, and it\u2019s a long term agreement, about a decade agreement, and we are in the last several years, providing flakes agreement. I am looking at it. Jon, [indiscernible] 17 maybe? 17 is the last year of that Jon, and it has formula step-in, so we actually took a slight stepdown in price this quarter versus last quarter, but that's kind of -- I think its going to generally run its course, and will be at this kind of level going forward, for the next couple of years. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : And last one if I might --? Mark Rohr : [Indiscernible]. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : Sorry. Could you give us your assessment of the long term supply/demand trends in the filter tow business and sort of what you're seeing on the ground? Mark Rohr : Yeah. I'd be happy to. So that's a business that has been in decline in the developed world for a number of years. It has been growing primarily in Asia, primarily in China there to the tune of 3% to 4% per year. As the new regime took over and imposed a number of restrictions on the use of government credit cards, we saw actually a shift in that, and this year we think will be about flat in China. So the net effect of that probably has pushed the industry down, and these are my numbers, which take from what they're worth, my numbers would be 1% to 1.5% volume down right now, kind of globally. Now the backstop on that, the background on that, you recall we shut down, spun, and we took a fair amount of volume out ourselves last year. I was actually surprised how the industry seemed to be building volume around that time. The industry was running the very high 90% capacity utilization, maybe mid-90 kind of numbers and I think, but I can't tell you how much Bob, that inventory was built with all the end customers that -- through last year. We certainly saw that with some of our customers. As confidence has returned, the industry can handle the rates, some of that is backing out. So we are seeing some reduction of sales to customers, well we know -- our customer's demand has not changed, if that makes sense. We are seeing some moderation of that inventory, but I think that's kind of running this course through this year. That's a very long way to understand, we think we are kind of flat this year, and we think we will be kind of flat next year, as we see what really unfolds in China. Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Thanks for the help. Mark Rohr : Great. Thanks. Jon Puckett : Thanks Bob. Laura, let's move to the next question. Operator : Okay. Next we have Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Mark, could you touch on -- there was a big announcement in the U.S. cigarette industry this week with consolidation between Reynolds, Lorillard and I guess, Imperial Tobacco playing a role. What are your thoughts on that? I can imagine some situations where that could be very good for you, I could imagine some takes to it as well. Can you remind us which of those are your customers and just how you are thinking about that in general? Mark Rohr : I'd really not say which one exactly our customers are, but we sell to a lot of folks, and so you shouldn't be surprised if we don't sell to some of those folks. Its not at all surprising to me. This is an industry that where you've had -- it\u2019s a very distributed industry, primarily put in place to serve the fibers industry guys, long time ago. So you have got a lot of small facilities around the world, supporting tobacco industry and tobacco industry itself has got a lot of small facilities around the world supporting a number of brands. So there is going to be a natural consolidation that it goes through, as we go forward. I think that's a real healthy thing. That's my personal view on it. So it didn't surprise us. I expect you will see more, and I expect, just like you saw us take down an inefficient plant, you will see those kind of things going on and this industry kind of keeps itself in balance through the next couple of decades. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just on the -- I know you don't impart Nutrinova anymore, but on the sweetener business, how core is that still? We saw last week I think, the wild flavors business was sold at a pretty attractive multiple, relative to where you guys trade. So how are you thinking about that, from a -- from that perspective? Mark Rohr : It\u2019s a really interesting business. What we do in -- if I think about it from a customer facing technology point of view, we combine chemistry and applications to -- in a pretty unique way for the industry, and what's nice about that business is, we actually do that on a organic chemistry perspective. We are actually designing flavors and designing taste. I like that model, I like that concept, take chemistry and really modify it in a unique way and create a very unique application for the end market. So that kind of model is an integral part of Celanese. Having said that, we have strong ambitions for that business, and we are putting a lot of energy and effort into driving it. If it got to a point where someone else could drive that better, we'd certainly consider that. Right now, we think we are the right company to promote that technology and that brand, and I think inherently, its good for Celanese too, having that portfolio. Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thanks Vince. Jon Puckett : Thanks Vincent. Laura, let's move to the next question. Operator : So next we have Jeffrey Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan : Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan : In the equity income and other category, you have other activities and in the quarter you reported $36 million, I think it was $10 million in the year ago quarter, and often its sort of five or six. What is that number, why is it so big? Mark Rohr : Chris, you want to take Jeff through that? Christopher Jensen : Yeah Jeff; that other activity segment has got a lot of stuff in it, but think of it generally being the functional activities of the company. In addition to that, another big slug is the non-service cost, elements of our pension programs globally go through there. So that movement you're seeing quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, I think I mentioned in the comments that we are pre-released. Some of that is just the timing of when our compensation changes come through. Some of it is money we are spending on initiatives that benefit the whole company and that's why they show up in that other area. Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan : I didn't mean the other activities in the operating profit line, I meant the other activities in the equity earnings line? Mark Rohr : That's primarily related to our interest -- Chris, do you want to cover that one? Christopher Jensen : Yes. There are several, and one of them is particularly large. Investments in these [indiscernible] companies over in Germany who manage side operations, side infrastructure for multi-plant chemical sites, and we have partial ownership in some of those operations. So if you're looking at the increase that you see there, quarter-on-quarter, mostly relates to a debt restructuring that happened, cleared down at a subsidiary level, underneath one of those investments. It was a situation where they had the opportunity to favorably restructure their debt. There was a big gain that came through. Its about $48 million for the company and most of it shows up in that other line that you're seeing. Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan : Maybe I can follow-up. So my second question is, I guess a question for Mark, when you look at the European economy and the Chinese economy, do you now see them on a much firmer footing or do you have a different view? How do you see your demand from those two regions in particular going forward? Mark Rohr : Yeah Jeff, if we just look at that, the first half this year, every economy in the world is better for every business we have year-over-year with the exception of Brazil, where we are seeing some slowdown, some systemic slowdowns that are impacting the automobile industry there, and most of our business there is auto related. In Europe, Europe has certainly learned to manage their debt crisis, or seems to be managing their debt crisis in a way that there is more certainty throughout the EU in their future. Of course, we are big players in the Engineered Materials space there and the Auto space, and that has been classically pretty good, although we are seeing some trends down year-over-year in Automotives there, that will probably impact us a bit in the second half. But if you look at coatings, if you look at C1 [ph] chemistry derivatives. Generally speaking, Europe is doing fine, and some signs of life and regions of Europe that have been pretty stagnant. So we are pretty pleased with Europe. India is better. Part of that is just pure optimism over Modi, but I think it is sort of the nature being down for so long, things have started picking up again, they seem to have more confidence to make investments there, that certainly had not been in place. Southeast Asia seems to be doing well. We are particularly pleased with our progress in Indonesia as an example, and feel pretty good about the election change that's occurred there and then what that means for that economy. In China, yeah, China is getting better Jeff. I think there is tremendous support for the Chinese government by the citizens of that country. There is a strong view that the Premier has the mandate to address the economic and social challenges of the country, and they have given him lots of latitude to do that. His moves against corruption there have been really positive and well received. So we feel good about China and one of the things I will say, maybe this is wishful thinking, is that the move on a part of a Chinese government to address some of the poor legacy investment decisions they have made, tighten up liquidity a bit, I think is trading [indiscernible] where businesses are making more rational decisions now than they used to make. At least it seems that way to me. We are not seeing a lot of crazy investments in our space. Investments that were guaranteed to have no return. That just doesn't seem to be happening right now. So industries are getting a bit tighter, and pricing is -- has more of a flavor, so it should return on capital to it today than it used to have. So we feel pretty good about the world, notwithstanding some of the craziness that's going on in some parts of it right now. Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan : Okay. Thank you very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks Jeff. And Laura, let's move to the next question, and we will have that be the last set of questions. Operator : Okay then. Our final question will come from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Thanks so much. Mark, just wanted to revisit AI. More specifically your guidance for the second half of the year. For $165 million in EBITDA going down to what you referred to as a more normal quarterly run-rate of $110 million to $120 million. So I just wanted to get a sense of sort of what really is embedded in that guidance with regards to, how much of that decline is coming from, call it, moderating acetyl pricing, or how much of that is from, let's say, higher methanol prices? Mark Rohr : Hassan, there is nothing wrong with your question boss, I am probably not smart enough to answer it. What I will tell you directionally, is that we think we are roughly the same or trending down just a little bit and in AI, second quarter to third quarter and we think it would be a deeper trend down in the fourth quarter, as some of these great companies out there that have not been able to run their plants or get them back in operation. And when we do that math and kind of roll it all up, and we get our earnings in the second half to be a little bit less than our earnings in the first half, and that kind of gives us the forecast that we have out there. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : But I mean, more specifically on just the raw side of things, are you expecting sort of any headwinds from raws? Will it be a tailwind? Mark Rohr : No. I am not expecting any headwinds in raws, nor am I expecting any headwinds in raws, nor am I expecting any favorability either. I think within that norm, we go out there and we try to make sure we cover, if we have headwinds and if we have -- we always try to make money, so if we get an extra penny that comes through from raw materials, that's great, we try to put it in our back pocket. But no, I wouldn't -- I think -- there is nothing wrong again with your question, but I think our ability to be real specific with that is just a bit of a challenge. So I will give you an example in the -- if you look at it from a second quarter to the third quarter -- for our corporation as a whole, we think we are going to be -- maybe a little bit favorable in the third quarter versus the second quarter in raws. That's may be -- but at the same time, if I look at that in the second half versus the first half, maybe we are going to be impacted maybe to the tune of $20 million, as we see some real changes in some of the fundamental materials in different spots in the world. So that's the kind of volatility we see moving through these numbers, all of which we try to just manage on a day-to-day basis. Christopher Jensen : Hassan, let me add one thing there too. When you asked your question, I think I heard you say 165 of EBITDA versus 110 or 120? When you said 110 to 120, he was talking about EBIT, 165 was our EBITDA. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Understood. Christopher Jensen : There is 120 there. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Understood, fair enough. Now just with the guidance for 2015, that sort of earnings hit guidance from the contract expiration. Just wanted to get a sense of, what does that bake in, in terms of operations at the new facility? Does that bake in sort of normal operations collate in Q4, because you were quite specific in saying the plant should be sort of ready by September and operational in October. So does that factor in, sort of a full fourth quarter of normal operations? Mark Rohr : That's exactly right. So what we have said when we worked our schedule out, that we will be fully exposed for one quarter to commercial methanol prices of next year, and then every one quarter next year, and this will be the fourth. We will have operational -- our facility, that will cover two thirds of that domestic methanol, and the other third will be exposed. That's how we do the math in there. Of course, I can't guarantee you that day-to-day but that's our best guesstimate on that date. So each day that moves around, let's call it $0.5 million, that's the kind of volatility in there. The other one you have got is nat gas, and actually methanol costs in U.S., those are the three factors that go in that math. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Understood. And a final one if I may; obviously we saw West Lake announce an MLP, favorable reaction to that. Within the methanol domain, you have an MLP in OCIT, good multiple there. Now as you're starting up this methanol facility and considering potentially another methanol facility. Any thoughts regarding sort of fighting for an MLP for those? Mark Rohr : Yeah, Chris you want to -- I mean, we have certainly looked at -- not for the first and the second, but the first is done without the second. Christopher Jensen : Hassan, I wanted to step back and say first of all, the timing, if we did something like that, would be quite ways out [ph] I mean, these things have to be fully operational, making money before you can go try to sell shares in an MLP. I just want to make sure everybody is worried that this would be your [indiscernible] (44:09). It is something we have looked at. We are sharpening our pencils on that. One of the things we want you to know, that we think about is, the fact that enter into that space as a trade between getting paid now and yeah, we understand the concept of the multiples that happen in these deals, versus having appropriate pricing on our methanol that we need going forward, and that's what we look at. Hassan Ahmed - Alembic Global : Understood. Thank you so much guys. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot. Appreciate your questions. Jon Puckett : So with that, that's the last question. So we will wrap up here. Folks, I will be around to take calls later, as well as Mark and Chris. So just let us know what's on your minds. Thanks for your time this morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Please go ahead, sir. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Laura. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2014 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President, Finance. The Celanese Corporation third quarter 2014 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation\u2019s future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we will field your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks John, and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with the earnings, so I will keep my comments brief, then open the line for your questions. We had a really strong quarter with adjusted EPS of $1.61 per share, the highest in our history. Segment income margin expanded 300 260 basis point year-over-year driven by higher pricing in consumer specialties, industrial specialties and Acetyl Intermediates which more than offset higher raw material cost. On a sequential basis, segment income margin expanded 150 basis points, primarily due to higher price in industrial specialties and Acetyl Intermediates. These results drove record operating cash flow of $379 million, and free cash flow of $227 million, consolidated [ph] in return $139 million to shareholders and $39 million in dividends and $98 million in share repurchases. These are really great results and should help us deliver 2014 adjusted earnings that range from $5.55 to $5.65 per share or 23% to 26% growth over last year. We also made significant progress in our methanol unit in Clear Lake, Texas, and have provided you with our action plans, also headwinds as we move from purchase to self-produced methanol. Looking at the year ahead, we believe the customer focused approach in our materials business and commercial actions and our technology-enabled businesses will provide us appropriate opportunities to meet the challenges in 2015 like potential softness in the global economies, fewer industrial outages, and stronger dollar versus Euro. For 2015, our objectives are to deliver adjusted earnings that are consisting with our expected range for 2014. With that, I will now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Mark. Laura, we\u2019ll open up for questions. I\u2019d like to just ask everybody to keep it to one question and one follow-up. So Laura, go ahead. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And the first question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you, good morning. Mark, just \u2013 how are you thinking about the level of over earning in the segment in Q3 and what\u2019s sustainable going forward at the Q4 and 2015? Mark Rohr : Well, David, we \u2013 I commented on that in the last couple of calls, its \u2013 I guess it were also \u2013 clearly, the industry has reset to some degree. By that I mean there has been some material changes in trade flows around the world. Product is generally [indiscernible] in the past and there is more discipline in the market, particularly in China than we\u2019ve seen historically. So there is a portion of this that we\u2019ll be referring but to be honest we\u2019re not really going to get sense on that until we get in that industry. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Great. And just in Hoechst [ph] in China, anymore thoughts on whether this business is plateauing there or peeking on this \u2013 in a long slow decline, demand wise? Mark Rohr : Well I think we \u2013 if you look at from a volumetric basis David, we certainly believe that the business is generally peaking volumetrically. And we saw a step down in China early this year; it\u2019s not recovered from that so we\u2019ve kind of maintained this volume at this lower rate. I\u2019m a little concerned about the Chinese economy because you see a lot of the cigarette purchases or the second tier brands that go to everyday man and woman, and right now those folks are struggling a bit. But right now our view is that we\u2019re kind of \u2013 we are where we are, we\u2019re going to be at this level for sometime. Rolling it back around, we do think there is excessive inventory in a few spots around the world and we\u2019re trying to assess if some of that inventory comes off what the impact would be before that. But you shouldn\u2019t take that if it occurs as has been in the case and there has been further drop in volume consumption. David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks, David. Laura, let\u2019s move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Good morning. I guess first the $0.15 to $0.20 in restructuring savings that you flag, is that a year end run rate? And if not, what would that be? Christopher Jensen : As you\u2019re referring to the restructuring, we talk about the \u2013 anyways we\u2019re \u2013 and European, is that what you mean specifically? Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Correct. So, is that just a tailwind in 2015 or is that an exit of the run rate pulling forward? Christopher Jensen : Yes, I\u2019m sorry. And I\u2019m Chris, David \u2013 I mean Laurence, I thought you were referring to capital structure. It\u2019s \u2013 you should look at that as the impact for next year. In the run rate going forward, I would hope we crippled it higher than that, that\u2019s how you should look at that. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. And secondly, as you look at the outages that you\u2019re anticipating for next year, how we\u2019re those compared to this year? Christopher Jensen : Well, corporately, we\u2019re about the same. And the comment I made, the generic comment I mean on outages is that there were number \u2013 particularly on the human chemistry arena unscheduled or unplanned outages this year and I would expect there would be fewer of those next year and I can\u2019t predict what that is but I would expect the industry operates more reliably next year than it has this year. Laurence Alexander \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, thank you. Christopher Jensen : Thanks, Laurence. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Laurence. Laura, let\u2019s move to the next. Operator : Sure. Next we have John McNulty of Credit Suisse. John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So when you gave color on your outlook for 2015, you highlighted a bunch of puts and takes, and I guess, I\u2019m wondering when you\u2019re thinking about the growth for AM and consumer, how are you thinking about that in terms of the growth rates in 2015 and how much of that will come from what you highlighted around the customer centric approach and some of the technology offerings that you\u2019re offering versus just general market demand? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think when you look at general market demand, I will talk more about materials and consumer but we\u2019ve had really pretty good year of market growth this year, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And next year, we think that will be moderated, and having said that, we have a lot of new products in lot of new platforms, that will start to come to fruition, so we\u2019re expecting good growth in new materials year-over-year driven by new products we put in there as we expect a good growth from our innovation products, things like the high voltage transmission line that we talked to you guys about recently. So we\u2019re seeing \u2013 I view as pretty strong growth in the material segment on a year-over-year basis. In the consumer side, don\u2019t really see any volume growth in that business, we do see other opportunities though to incrementally squeeze a little bit of increased profitability of that businesses as we enter into next year. On the AI side, I think it\u2019s going to be \u2013 I need a little more clarity on what the rephrase [ph] is because I can really answer that directly but we have a lot of productivity related initiatives that will contribute to earnings growth in that business. John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great, thanks very much for the color. Mark Rohr : Thanks, John. Okay, our next question Laura? Operator : So the next question comes from PJ Jukvar [ph] of Citi. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: Very good morning, its Eric Petrie in for PJ. If I could ask, what is the sensitivity to your $100 million purchase versus produced methanol if in 2015, if methanol prices stay closer to $400 per ton versus your $500 million to $600 million per ton assumption? Christopher Jensen : When we talked about this being $100 million range, $75 million to $125 million, in 2015, that\u2019s assuming methanol in a $500 million to $550 million range and natural gas in $425 million to $500 million range. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: I might follow it offline. And then \u2013 Mark Rohr : Go ahead. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: I\u2019m sorry\u2026 Mark Rohr : I was going to say to answer your question with the $75 million to $125 million, methanol you want to push down to lower end of the range but like we\u2019ve said, we don\u2019t know where methanol is going to be when we step off of that contract. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving you the ranges, $75 million to $125 million. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: Okay, so you\u2019re saying $400 per ton would put you in that $75 million ballpark? Mark Rohr : It puts you closer to that number than the $500 million to $600 million that we\u2019ve assumed. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: Okay. And then just on a longer term, of the three industrial ethanol MOUs, that you have outstanding which do you expect to press quicker or have less regulatory hurdles to get to reach to market? Mark Rohr : You said methanol or ethanol, Eric? Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: The industrial ethanol MOUs that you have in Indonesia, China, India. Mark Rohr : Yes, those are all fuel applications and it\u2019s harder probably \u2013 I think China has got the toughest route [ph] because you got to change, you got to have pretty broad approach to change fuel regulations within China and so far that process hasn\u2019t gained lot of traction. Indonesia was doing extremely well from a project point of view, it still seems to be endorsed by the government and the indications are the new government is also endorsing but we need to go through that change and leadership in Indonesia, including the new CEO from Pertamina. And so I think we\u2019ll have better sense of that in our January fall. India is just getting started, the economics are very good in India, and in some ways the decision making process will be easy so, I\u2019d say China is probably third and it\u2019s too soon to tell which is more likely, India or Indonesia. Eric Petrie \u2013 Citi: Okay, thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Eric. Laura, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : Yes, next we have Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo. Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo : Good morning and congratulations on the record quarter. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Frank. Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo : When you talked about 2015 and the productivity enhancement of $0.15 to $0.20, and you also mentioned that you\u2019ve had some programs in place, what do you think those numbers would have been or will be for 2014, how much of the earnings improvement in 2014 would you ascribe to or productivity enhancements? Mark Rohr : On a big scale we started two facilities in 2013 that rolled into 2014, and I\u2019m kind of looking at a real start \u2013 that\u2019s probably $0.20 or so kind of number Frank that rolled through, something like that. Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo : Like probably $20 million to $30 million? Mark Rohr : We always have some productivity but to be very honest, this year was one of our weaker years in productivity. So I don\u2019t think other than assume those two outages, the ones that I\u2019m just too sure that was the one. Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo : Alright, that\u2019s very helpful. And can you give me your sense of the status business in Europe in particular, and \u2013 what you\u2019re seeing in the auto front and more broadly into the pace of activity over there? Mark Rohr : It\u2019s a good question. We all read the same press that you read, and you can\u2019t help to get little bit of concern about it when you read it but I think what we would say is that our customers generally are lot calmer than the markets are. We have seen European auto slowdown, we\u2019ve seen companies like Ford take extended outages and push out some products, so it is for reduction and consumption and the auto arena in Europe right now. The other businesses, the other areas here, I\u2019d say it\u2019s \u2013 nobody is, I mean nothing is falling off the cliff Frank, business is moving along, there is some talk of \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some focus, kind of act like they are starting to consume and drop inventory, we view that the reduction in commodity prices will somehow ripple through. So we may see in this quarter some destocking that\u2019s going on in Europe. And I\u2019d say also we\u2019re seeing some momentum for that in China just based on commodity prices I think more than anything. Frank Mitsch \u2013 Wells Fargo : Sure. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Frank. Laura, let\u2019s go to the next caller. Operator : Our next call, question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning. Mark, I guess a question on consumer specialties; you proposed a price increase of 5% to 6% in mid-September. What if the customer reception then over the last five weeks or so? Also what is your view on the raw material side there going into 2015, just trying to get a sense of what margins might do versus the volumetric peak that you referenced. Mark Rohr : Yes, we\u2019re in the middle of that process now with our customers so it\u2019s too early to call where we\u2019ll end up on the pricing side. For us raw materials period-to-period are pretty constant, they maybe a little bit of drift down as we worked off some more expensive inventory year-over-year, we\u2019re pretty confident. So I think from a margin point of view, I\u2019d look at the margin has been reasonably flat and our consumer year-over-year. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And then the second question if I may on acetyl intermediates, you referenced the structural reset in Europe and I think some of your materials overnight also referenced different outages and I think within the last week or so your principle Western competitor declared forced measure at Holland and UK. If you take that into account what are your thoughts on the 4Q profitability in that segment, do you get perhaps an extension of the benefits with these ongoing industry outages? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think there is probably little loose extension in that but we are seeing others take \u2013 there is more aggressive action in China and there is more destocking going, so don\u2019t get handled on volumetric movements for the quarter. But I do expect our earnings period-to-period to be down materially in that segment. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Alright, thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot. Jon Puckett : Thanks Kevin, Laura lets go to the next. Operator : The next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thank you, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs : I\u2019m just wondering you mentioned the benefits from the pan European and productivity initiatives; can you talk about what the costs for that might be? And then also, if you made any headway in perhaps securing a fixed or long term gas contract for the Clear Lake plant? Mark Rohr : Let me just lead on first and then I\u2019ll turn over to Chris to talk about European structure but \u2013 we have started to take in a few positions for that incremented gas in the fourth quarter, I don\u2019t know what percentage we are locked in now for that gas but probably half of it would probably locked so far but there are, Chris just told me. So we\u2019re doing that as it makes sense at these kind of prices, Bob. Chris, you want to tackle the \u2013 Christopher Jensen : Sure, principally Bob, there will be cost associated with that structuring going in Europe but as is typically the case when we have those kinds of transformational activities, that\u2019s the kind of stuff we typically run through the adjustments and take out when we present just to the EBIT. Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay and you mentioned in the prepared remarks using up to a million tons of methanol in the U.S., can you tell us the size of the contract and confirm that it expires at the end of June next year, that \u2013 the selling contract? Christopher Jensen : It\u2019s for million tones. Once we were contracting that full amount Bob. Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thank you. Christopher Jensen : Thanks. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Bob. Laura, let\u2019s move to the next. Operator : Next is Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks very much. You guys had mentioned, I think on the last call, when you sort of were discussion what mitigance [ph] you might have to \u2013 2015 headwinds, I think there was some discussion or maybe some tax optimization but you didn\u2019t mention that today. So just curious is that something that\u2019s still on the table or does it look at that and there is really not a whole lot of material to do there? Christopher Jensen : Vincent, this is Chris. When we talk about the structuring, this pan European structure that we\u2019re going through, that\u2019s part of what will happen there is potentially some tax savings that come from that. And what\u2019s really driving that is the desire to have a centralized European management structure similar to what we did a couple of years ago over in Asia. So prior to this plant we just \u2013 we really didn\u2019t have that structure in place, we want that in place, this is an important region for us and we want a team of leaders there who have a real pulse on what\u2019s going on in Europe that can run this thing day-to-day. But to answer your question there will be some tax savings that come as part of that. Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley : It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a material change in the rate? Christopher Jensen : Look, our tax rate should go down next year, and as we get closer to completion on the structure we can talk more about what it\u2019s going to be into the tax rate but it will go down, it should go down below 20 next year. Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks very much. I\u2019ll pass it along. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Vincent. Laura, let\u2019s go to the next. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan : Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan : Hi, I have a question about Europe, I guess Slide 16; your CapEx, you said you\u2019re lowering by $50 million to $400 to $450, wasn\u2019t your CapEx through the first three quarters in the low force, if you count the CapEx because to them in new methanol plant? Mark Rohr : Well, do you also \u2013 yes, Chris go ahead, you do some netting on the CapEx that goes into the methanol plant because we get some of that reversed by the \u2013 reimbursed by the joint venture. So our initial look on CapEx for the year, selling these CapEx was $4.50 to $5. And so what we\u2019re saying now is that $4.50 to $5 really is more like $400 to $450. Just because of some productivity measures and some other measures and some spend outside of methanol and outside of the gas boilers [ph]. Christopher Jensen : Yes, I don\u2019t have all the numbers in front of me to tail up those quarters but you can see that by taking a look in the filings that will put \u2013 I\u2019m sure, they will tell you on top of my head those, yes, it\u2019s a little bit waited in the fourth quarter, I mean, we\u2019re have a little more CapEx in the fourth quarter than we had in the third quarter, the third quarter was little higher than what you saw in the first two quarters. And when you go through that make sure as John said in that \u2013 what you see coming in from our JV partner in mid [ph] on different line on those financials. But that\u2019s the range now we\u2019re talking $4 to $4.50 for the year. Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan : Perhaps I can follow up with that. Are you making money currently in Chinese ethanol? I think Chinese ethanol prices, industrial ethanol prices per ton are somewhat over $1000 a ton, or is it more complicated than that? Mark Rohr : No, no, it\u2019s nothing more complicated than that. It\u2019s just hard to answer that question directly but I would say, not in a material fashion that\u2019s how we describe that. It\u2019s not \u2013 the business is just kind of bouncing along Bob, we\u2019ve knocked down away really to extract a lot of value of the industrial ethanol market in China today. Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan : Okay, good. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Jeff. Laura, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : The next question will come from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global : Hello Mark, how are you? Mark Rohr : Hello. Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global : A question around AI as it relates to your 2015 guidance. If I take a look at sort of EBITDA margins towards the end of 2013, they were running at 12% to 13%, and that\u2019s obviously prior to a variety of these outages, and today they are closer to 20%. So how should we think about what you\u2019re baking into 2015 guidance for this segment \u2013 is today\u2019s margin profile more representative, is sort of \u2013 end of last year\u2019s more representative or somewhere in between? Mark Rohr : Yes, somewhere between and we\u2019re doing that math ourselves and trying to sort out. There is \u2013 no doubt that those margins will pull back to some degree but I do want to be clear that that market is bit different today and there is more discipline in that market. So we\u2019re trying to go through systematically and triangulate than what we believe a proper outlook for the year will be and we just haven\u2019t got to that point yet. What I will say is that where we \u2013 we\u2019ll do the range of potential step downs from where we are today, we\u2019re seeing opportunities to offset that, so that\u2019s why it gives us some comfort to go out and say that even though you\u2019re going to have headwinds in methanol, even though you\u2019re going to have headwinds from these sort of global economic scenarios that are out there and you\u2019re going to have some headwinds as some of the tightness within the \u2013 see one change gets away, we think we can overcome these things and end up in an essence at that year end, and knew that we have to [ph]. Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global : Fair enough. And, moving onto the methanol plant, very recently a methanol MLP in the U.S. talked about sort of jacking up the bottle making cost or budget by around 30% and kind of caught them by surprise, you know, if I read your sort of comments rightly, you were talking about how things are quite tight on the NC side of things but you are sticking to the original budget that you gave out. Now what gives you confidence that there will not be any slippage there or any sort of uptake in that budget? Is it something in the contract or \u2013 Mark Rohr : No, no, no, there is no guarantee, I have confidence in the team and how we\u2019re running that. We have unbelievable just a great team, we have great contractors, we\u2019re engaged daily, under the activity \u2013 we\u2019re just all over the project, we \u2013 I would say that we\u2019re into it a bit certain than others and so we haven\u2019t suffered from skill shortage today, we\u2019re now in the mechanical portion which means we need lot of welders and that\u2019s an area that is most concerned from our point of view right now and we have not only great contractors providing your people but we have some back options, those fail. I should let you know though it is a very close budget, I mean, we have \u2013 we measure the gaps down a percentage. So should we end up being a bit over, sure we could, but if I can advance today, start-up the day by day or two, I\u2019ll spend the money to do that because the credit for shorting the period of time that we\u2019re fully on the market is just huge for our company. Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global : Fair enough. And with this sort of an E&C market is that second methanol plant still looking feasible? Mark Rohr : Yes, when you look at it \u2013 I mean, you can overreact or underreact, I guess the situation is we\u2019re certainly are looking at the current kind of collapse and commodity pricing and maybe ripple effects of that and thinking our way through but the folks we\u2019re talking to are still quite interested and we\u2019ll have to make a decision to a couple of candidates as we get into November and we like to be in a position like spring to either have a project and another project. And even if we do it next spring, you\u2019re talking a long time; we still have \u2013 even though we started the Permian process several months ago, that\u2019s 18 months process now. So this is a start-up that will occur quite few years out. Hassan Ahmed \u2013 Alembic Global : Fair enough, thanks so much Mark. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Hassan. Laura, let\u2019s move to the next question. Operator : And our next question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust. James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust: Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019ve given a lot of color on the methanol headwind in North America. I was just wondering if you could comment on the Acetic Acid business in Asia and where you see pricing going next year in light of the drop in crude oil prices globally, do you see that as having an impact on your earnings in Asia. And do you have anything \u2013 any leverage you can pull there in terms of your strategic changes to your business model that can offset that, how you\u2019re looking at the Asia market? Mark Rohr : The Asia market margins throughout this year has been pretty good for those businesses, they are probably little weaker today than have been on the average as we\u2019ve gone through the year, pricing has pulled back a little bit in China. So we may exceed some margin compression as we go into next year but what I would say is that the margins are materially different than they were back in the 2012, 2103, kind of timeframe, there is that market exchange we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve seen a step change there. So, I think our expectations are as far as little bit weakness in margins next year James, that\u2019s how I capture that. In China, that everything is coal based, coal pricing, kind has the floor, it\u2019s been slow for a while and its methanol based, and methanol kind has a floor, and there it\u2019s been at that floor for a while. So there is no change in manufacturing costs, I think practically possible for Chinese producers. James Sheehan \u2013 SunTrust: Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Jim. Laura, let\u2019s go to the next. Operator : Next we have Edlain Rodriguez of UBS. Edlain Rodriguez \u2013 UBS: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Edlain. Edlain Rodriguez \u2013 UBS: Just one quick question on AEM, I mean this business has a lot of exposure to Europe and to auto, I mean, if there is a slowdown in Europe, can you talk about how this business is now better positioned than it was before and how results will be more vigilant than they were in previous challenging times that we\u2019ve had in Europe? Mark Rohr : Yes, let me try. I think all those about 40% of that business, maybe 50%, globally. And if you look at Europe, you got to kind of separate Germany from the rest of Europe. And what\u2019s great about Germany is they build lot of the high end vehicles that are purchased by all of us around the world, and those higher end vehicles are big things for the kind of how we engineer materials that we sell. So we are seeing our ability to penetrate those vehicles continue to grow. And so that gives us comfort that even as we fall to an anticipated lower build in the Americas and lower builds in Europe that we\u2019ll be okay. If you look at Asia, we have fairly low penetration in Asia; we have a good success now starting there, so we think there is a lot of growth upside in Asia. So my belief is, we really have mid-single digit growth in the auto segment in that business year-over-year. And when you go beyond that, in industrial spaces, in electronic spaces, consumer spaces, we have a lot of activity underway, and have seen some really good success with products and I mentioned one example of that which was the composite based high voltage wire that is starting to be strong in places like Houston, Texas, getting in great reviews from utility companies because it lets them lower their cost. So we have a view that things like that, that\u2019s just one example, we\u2019ll also come into some degree and start to lift this up more even if it falls a bit weak next year. Edlain Rodriguez \u2013 UBS: Okay, thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Edlain. Let\u2019s move to the next question Laura. Operator : Next we have Neil Wallin of CLSA [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. In AEM you had some pretty powerful volume growth over the last six quarters or so and you had \u2013 prices have been down year-over-year for the last five, I attribute that to mix, but I\u2019m wondering if there is any way to reverse that or next year the comps will get better on the pricing side in that business? Mark Rohr : Well part of it is mix and part of it is Asia. Asia generically it\u2019s a lower priced market than some other parts of the world and that\u2019s been a big thrust of ours to push into Asia. Do I see that change a lot year-over-year, no, I mean I think it\u2019s going pretty constant year-over-year, what I do expect is that we can get more specification business and some of the higher end applications that \u2013 it would all set any increase penetration we may make in Asia in terms of pricing. So my gut [ph] would say pretty confident. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, that makes sense. And then just on the volume declines in consumer specialties, obviously I know that there is destocking going on so it\u2019s probably hard to get a sense of what the underlying volume levels are but do you \u2013 would you be able to quantify or give us some qualification as to what you see the underlying demand in that business being? Mark Rohr : We\u2019ve reported, the data \u2013 we belong to an association that collects data from all the producers, blind data, and producers represent annual trends, and I don\u2019t have the annual trends, what I say in the middle of the year we pushed an indication too that we were down and in the \u2013 on the subject kind of basis in the 1% to 2% range, kind of number. And the biggest revelation out of that was not new news because we have been talking about it but it was more steep fall off in China. China had always been a contributor in terms of volume growth and this year they were going to be actually down year-over-year. So that\u2019s the most contemporary data that we really have, what I will say is talking to customers, what we feel is that we\u2019re in for a fairly flat consumptive view year-over-year, and the only wild card we have in here is inventory. And several years ago when industry was very tied, I would say that the majority that the consumers had built surplus inventory and it\u2019s pretty clear to me now that they have been working out often, I think I was going to continue to through the end of this year, maybe early next year, I just can\u2019t, I would love to tell you exactly where the details were but we don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll be able to give you more color in January. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate the color, thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Neil. And Laura, let\u2019s move to the next caller and this will be the last question. Operator : Okay. And that question will come from Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffrey. Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Pipe Jaffray : Hi, good morning. As a quick follow up to a previous question about how the materials businesses might fill in for the difficult comps from the industry just impacts. How much do you view it as a series of singles from clear foil and expanding chorus versus driving auto penetration from two kilograms to two and a half kilograms, or whatever? Mark Rohr : The history that business has been a single\u2019s business and we\u2019re trying to change that. Mike, we\u2019re trying to make it more \u2013 what we call a translation business, where we\u2019re going to have a success like we clear foil, the reason I used that example, we\u2019re not selling a lot of clear film to free search [ph] today but when you look at the power that technology building the market that we\u2019re taking successful products and moving them laterally in the marketplace and so that\u2019s what \u2013 my personal belief is that\u2019s where the real growth is going to be in industry. You see that a lot in auto, in particular, where our penetration varies dramatically from model to model, manufacturer to manufacturer, one region of the world to region of the world, and so our ability to take a success from one part of the world, and one particular car manufacturer to another is what I think is going to define our ability to dramatically build this business in years to come. Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Pipe Jaffray : Okay, just real quick if I can speak one last one. Obviously one of the positives here in the last couple of quarters has been the impact of trade flows, I was wondering if there is a way to quantify the impact of currency in 4Q on those tradeflows in AI obviously? Mark Rohr : I\u2019m looking at Chris. What are the rules of [indiscernible]. Christopher Jensen : Yes, so it\u2019s more than just the trade flows, so if you look at what drives currency impacts the part of it is that business and the fact that we don\u2019t manufacture acetic acids or vamp [ph] in Europe, so that\u2019s part of that Euro, so you get some currency there, you get some currency in the engineered materials business which is just a strong business for us in Europe even though we have local manufacturing, so we have high margins that just drops some currency impact on the bottom line. So \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we have provided rules sometime in the past but it\u2019s probably somewhere in the range of Euro/penny change equating to $600,000, $700,000, $800,000 in a quarter. Michael Ritzenthaler \u2013 Pipe Jaffray : Okay. Alright, thanks guys. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Mike, and thanks Laura. We\u2019ll be wrapping for questions all day today. We appreciate your time this morning. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Please go ahead. Jon Puckett : Thanks Drew. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2014 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President, Finance. The Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2014 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation\u2019s future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with some introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we'll field your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks John; and good morning everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments brief then open the line for your questions. I'm pleased to report the completion of a record year with a record quarter, reporting 2014 adjusted earnings of $5.67 per share, which reflects 26% growth over the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share, that's 23% growth year-over-year. Our results were driven by changing dynamics in the Acetyl Chain, the ability of our materials business to identify, develop and provide specific materials to our customers, and strong commercial and manufacturing performance. Sales for the year totalled $6.8 billion. That's an increase of 4.5%. And operating cash flow totalled $962 million setting a record for the company. Consolidated segment income margins increased 240 basis points to 18.6%, really great performance. As we start 2015, our underlying business is quite healthy and should help us offset some of the headwinds we expect to see through the year, particularly the fallen euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate, lower crude oil impacts on pricing and margins in the petrochemical industry, lower energy and raw materials cost, the cellulosic inventory correction and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. We have a solid list of actions; our teams are working, that should help minimize the impact of some of these headwinds and set us up for growth through the year and into 2016. In this volatile environment we expect first quarter earnings to be consistent year-over-year and our full year to be in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett : Thanks Mark. I'd like to remind everybody, we'd like to you ask one question and one follow-up and then we'll move to the next. Drew, go ahead. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Duffy Fisher of Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fisher : Yeah. Good morning, fellows. Jon Puckett : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fisher : A question on tow, when your competitors kind of called out some inventory issues after Q2 of last year and you guys, at that time, didn\u2019t see it. Now it seems to be hitting you. Can you just talk about what's your visibility in that market? How comfortable are you with the analysis that you've done that you'll be able to, kind of, deliver your internal budget against that business. Mark Rohr : Yeah. Thanks, Duffy. Yeah, if I go back a bit in time, Duffy, it became apparent to us as we were shutting down Spondon there had been actually a slow -- not slow, but a trend in the part of the industry to maintain fairly hot tow volumes. And I think that was a reflection of the overall tightness in capacity that existed for several years. We took down Spondon in '12 and that sort of -- in late '12, and that sort of increased yet again. And we've reminded folks of that. Our customers have, for the most part, managed that pretty well. I think others; they've got an early signal of that and reported those results to you. We're talking just directly with our customers, Duffy, and they seem to indicate with tremendous sincerity that they want to go in and take a step change in inventory. And when they look beyond that they think it will return. But the inside I just have is dealing with the customers that we are interface with. Duffy Fisher : Okay. And then just on the numbers, you called out $0.30. If I just kind of run that through your P&L that's about $60 million in EBIT, run that through the margins in that segment and that's about $200 million in revenue roughly, which is about a third of the first half revenue from last year. Are those the right numbers that we could actually see revenue down a third in that segment in the first half? Mark Rohr : Yeah. I don't tend to look at that way. We really look at EBIT. EBIT numbers are absolutely I think what we are expecting. Duffy Fisher : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks fellows. Mark Rohr : Yeah. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Duffy. Drew, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, also on tow, what will you get pricing-wise this year as tow pricing can be up or down. And any change in your view as to the longer-term demand trends and actually what's your view right now as to the long-term demand trends in tow going forward? Mark Rohr : Yeah. We have some mix effects in price, you know, because of swap agreements we have. But generally speaking, the industry pushed pricing early in the cycle and we got little bit of pricing, as we ended the cycle we gave up some pricing. So pricing net-net with mix is down a little bit year-over-year as well, let's say, David, in that. The general trends that we see, I think if I look at the world outside of China we've been in this gradual decline. We haven't seen that slope change very much. If you look at China, China certainly through the step change early last year that we talked at length about. They seem to be running at pretty steady rates now and anticipating pretty flat volume year-over-year. David Begleiter : Very good. And Mark, just lastly on Acetyl Medians. Can you help us with the bridge of earnings in '15 versus '14 taking into account the hit from the expired methanol contract, the over-earning of VAM in '14? Any examples of the bridge there '14 versus '15 in AI? Chris Jensen : Yeah, David, it's Chris. So the methanol contract, we've talked about that being I think $0.40 to $0.60 per share on a year-over-year basis. If methanol stays its lower level that it is now, we're going to be at the low end of that estimate. I think your other question was more around kind of the VAM industry shift. It's really hard to clearly separate that from just everything else going on in the business. And in particular, in our teams' efforts this past year really changed the way we go to market, the way we approach customers, pricing, placing volumes. But having said all that if we were guessing, I think we'd guess that number maybe in the $70 million to $80 million year-on-year. David Begleiter : To the VAM decline year-over-year? Mark Rohr : Yeah, David. And I think that's a number that Chris shared with you, it's the number we use internally as we kind of range find it. But it's very hard to -- it's very hard to quantify, but right now as we look at the bridge that's the number that we internalize. David Begleiter : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks, David. Drew, let's move to the next. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. There were comments and remarks about just broader destocking about your customers and your suppliers. So can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing by end markets, which is -- how you think that might just stored first half trends versus back half, and implications for your working capital? Mark Rohr : Yeah. Primarily in this Acetyl Chains and how much of it is beyond the cellulose -- something about cellulose [skin] [ph] if you like. But what we've seen in the Acetyl Chain is a lot of -- the folks that are close to the petrochemical industry, people are just taking their time to purchase, David, is what I would say, they are looking for -- I mean Laurence, they are looking for that. So they are looking for the bottom. So we've seen some order slip as we ended the year in the January and we've seen some slippage out of January. That's what I'm trying to respond to. So I think until we get a sense of really where the floor is and where prices are moving, a lot of folks, if they can delay purchases, are going to do so. That's one of the reasons. I think we're -- my personal view is all of us, we're going to be after little bit of a slow start as we begin the year. The second comment I'll make to that Laurence is Chinese New Year, as you know, falls a bit late. This year falls in mid-February-ish. That in Asia is again, as you know so well, creates a little bit of a conundrum and folks try to really anticipate what the world looks like after Chinese New Year. Laurence Alexander : And then, in terms of what that might mean for your working capital days this year? Chris Jensen : Yeah. David, this is Chris. It's a little difficult to predict because it will really depend on that slope on demand and volumes. You look back at 2014 in the working capital performance; the businesses did a really nice job of controlling that. We tend to look at that as working capital as a percentage of revenues and we experienced some levels that were really, really good in 2014. They managed that quite tightly. We watched this. And, of course, the risk you face in kind of a deflationary environment is that you're holding some inventory that was produced at a higher cost than your current procurement of raw materials would suggest. So, yes, there is a risk that if you see demand pressures you get a little bit [indiscernible] when you're looking at it as a percentage of revenues the way we do. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks Laurence. Drew, let's move to the next. Operator : The next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So with regard to the FX headwinds that you had highlighted, they seemed a little bit bigger than I recall kind of the moves being in the past. And I guess I'm wondering how much of that\u2019s tied to some of the closures that you've done in Europe and how much product you're maybe moving from say into the U.S. or other regions into Europe. Can you give us a little bit colour on that and maybe an update as to how much VAM and Acetic you actually do move to Europe from U.S.? Chris Jensen : Yeah. Let me -- it's Chris again, let me give you just kind of the high level picture of what we intended in the way that we put those remarks out there. So, we in kind of let's call it a more stable currency environment. We would estimate that $0.01 movement on the euro is about $0.03 to $0.04 a year for Celanese. But that\u2019s the view of how we're working in stable environment. When you'd see this kind of a significant quick movement in the euro that we have while that math would imply that the euro change year-on-year puts you at $0.60 or $0.70 a share that's kind of the first order effect and you can have second order effects that offset that. We'll certainly do what we can on pricing to recover some of that. You look at the strength of our business in Europe and parts of that are going to be in industries where a lower euro actually helps those export volumes. So, when we put that number out there that's really kind of the first order effect. Now, moving on to your question about volumes. Yeah, that's a bigger impact today than it would have been before. We closed plants in Europe. To kind of paint the picture for you, I can't walk through the details of volumes product by product, but let's call it maybe a third of this is just the fact that we have business in Europe. So it's just translation. Probably two-thirds or more of this is revenue based and the fact that we're now selling a substantial amount of asset yield products in Europe that are produced in the U.S. So you now have U.S. costs but Euro-based revenues. John McNulty : Okay. Great, No, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just with the second question. The $100 million of raw material relief that was highlighted in the transcript, is that incorporated in your guidance at this point? It wasn\u2019t exactly clear to us if it was or wasn\u2019t. Chris Jensen : No, I think what we're just talking about there is that we're seeing some step change. I think full and complete sense we could be down as much as $300 million in raw material. A good chunk of that is ethylene and a good chunk of ethylene remains formulated, so you wouldn\u2019t get any -- doesn\u2019t hurt other way. So when we looked at that, we kind of looked at the non-formulaic material base John and that\u2019s just simply a statement of view of how big the number could be. What we will attempt to do is keep it all and what I would say is that the others doing that are very, very low. So we will work hard to keep as much of that as we can and work the system to not lose that, but I just want to give folks a range of the kind of a good guy theory that's out there that we're going to try -- try to capture part of it. John McNulty : Great. Thanks for the color. Jon Puckett : Thanks John. Drew let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Good morning. And thank you for giving us the FX sensitivity at $15 to the Euro. Now are you taking any steps today to protect against any further potential weakening of the Euro? Mark Rohr : No. PJ we debated long and hard about that and of course it may be enhance I wish we should have done something about. But practically speaking our view is that we're not in the hedging business. We do take positions relative to receivables. So we do balance sheet work that sort of minimizes or protect sales that we currently have, but we don\u2019t go out beyond the realm of that 60-day kind of period. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And nothing related to your increase exports or anything like that. Mark Rohr : No, no. PJ Juvekar : Okay. And then when you talked about destocking in the Acetyl Chain [through it] [ph] can you talk about geographies. Is there a particular geography where you're seeing pronounced destocking relative to others? Mark Rohr : We'll, I think you're seeing in the -- there are two effects going on in that chain that need to sort themselves out and one is just a general -- the general movement of the industry to sort out where the base is, what\u2019s methanol going to be, what\u2019s CO is going to be. How is that relative from production point of view and customers out there, that have their hands out expecting prices to drop. And so there is the stocking that I am talking about really in on a point of view of the consumers who are working their inventory out of their system as quick as they can and delaying purchases as much as they can. We see that in Asia and in Europe both. The second effect that is unbelievably hard to quantify is the global trade flow that we're entering into -- the shift in global trade flows theoretically could happen as we get into the realization of what $50 crude means to the industry. So there you can have different value equations for production in different parts of the world that have changed from where they were say a year ago and that's going to impact trade flows and I\u2019ll be very honest PJ, we've not fully sorted that out this year. So the combination of those things and the realization of those things, means that the folks just are not -- they're doing everything they can, not to buy and trying to delay that a bit and of course there is a limited time I say I can do that, but they're trying to go seek and find the best pricing they can find from folks around the world. PJ Juvekar : Okay. Okay. So just to be clear, you said more destocking in Asia and Europe may be less in U.S. Mark Rohr : Yes. Yes. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks PJ. Drew let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentleman. In the release, you talked about quote \u201cpositive signs in Europe\u201d unquote, especially in auto. I am just wondering what sort of volume assumptions have you baked in to your guidance coming out of Europe and if could be a bit more granular in terms of particular areas of strength or weakness. Mark Rohr : Yes I think. I am talking just generally for a second if I can try Frank, we've had a lot of success growing our penetration and auto over the last several years to the extent now that we for several years, we've enjoyed a growth rate in autos of some multiple of the IHS data growth rate. So for instance, last year I think the overall industry grew 3.1% and our volumes grew about 9% into that industry. So this year, if you believe the data it would indicate they were off a bit, I think North America is 2.7% if my memory serves me down a bit in Germany, China\u2019s like 6% or 7% and globally we're about 2.3% or so. So we expect auto overall to be down a bit this year, but we're still seeing these trends, so our actual performance as we start this year in auto is very good. And I would say it's very good and I would say it's quietly slightly better than it was last year. Even though if you look at the trends bill trends, probably going to be down 2% in volume this first quarter year-over-year. So I don\u2019t know if it's really you asked, but we feel good about what\u2019s going on there. I think the industry as a whole, is moderating this growth just a little bit and areas like China are bit worrisome. I think you've read all reports on that. Brazil is pretty worse and Brazil has fallen quite steeply. Frank Mitsch : All right. That\u2019s helpful and I know you had said in the past that you had a $100 million EBIT bridge in 2015 some measures, I think it was improving plan operations, you were thinking that that would add like $45 million supply chain efficiencies would add about $25 million and innovation would add about $30 million. So I think that altogether $100 million call it around $0.50 a share and then in the release you said that your productive actions are $0.15 remain on track, am I worth the balance of that, is that on track and how should we think about that? Mark Rohr : When we talked about $100 million, we were outlining steps that we needed to take to overcome the methanol. Frank Mitsch : Correct. Yes. Mark Rohr : And so I\u2019ll try to say that in the script, we have done that. That\u2019s happening. So we believe that with the actions that we've already taken and we're taking that will be able to negate the methanol headwinds on an annualized basis. Beyond that we're driving more productivity and the $50 million is what's immediately in front of us today. We're working to find other things and develop other activities. So that\u2019s $0.15. So that was above and beyond the numbers we gave last time. Frank Mitsch : Terrific. Thank you so much. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks Frank. Drew let's move to the next question. Operator : Then next question comes from Cooley May of Macquarie. Please go ahead. Cooley May : Good morning, guys. Could you comment on the raw materials and particularly wood pulp, your ability to potentially maintain profit spreads in the back half of this year? And then also could this simply be a push back among your buyers? You're seeing your raw material basket drop, just holding off on buying and looking to push price low. Mark Rohr : Yes. So the first part -- would you repeat the first part of that Cooley. I am not sure I really understood what you said. Cooley May : The raw material setting in asset base, particularly wood pulp, per our data it looks to be down significantly and continuing a downward trend. I am trying to figure it out is this an industry wide issue? And where spreads are likely to settle out toward the end of the year and if you are buyer of wood pulp in Asia why would you buy here? Why wouldn't you destock inventory press price lower as much as you can. And how can you maintain a profit spread in that setting. Mark Rohr : Yes, I think -- if I go back to it from a consumption point of view, you cannot even see the price of tow and cigarette. You can't even see it. So from a point view of a consumer and I am not trying to say, consumers don\u2019t care about price, but the consumers really are just about indifferent about tow price. They are extremely concerned about tow reliability and availability and one of the reasons I kept all the inventory that they've kept Cooley. So I think if you look at it from a point of view of buyer, a buyer certainly don\u2019t want to be disadvantaged on one hand. The other hand they just want to, there they want the top quality and I think we've shared in the past how there is -- Alto is not the same. So it tends to be even some brand alignment around it to make sure the experience is the same from stick to stick. So we don\u2019t see that from our -- that kind of broad pressure from our customer base. When they fuss out is they fuss about reliability and making sure we got the volume to the bottom. If you look at the cost side, there has been some reductions in wood pulp. They are slowing through the industry and there may be some fringe buyers out there. So non-majors that are using that as you've said to try to put some pressure back on whoever their suppliers are, but I don\u2019t think -- I guess I would say, I don\u2019t think that's a trend. I don\u2019t think that that in itself foretells the collapse of a business. Model in I don\u2019t think its necessarily sustainable. Cooley May : Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yes thank. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thank you, Cooley. Let's move to the next question Drew. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes good morning. Mark, can you speak to the nexus between the collapse in crude oil and your future capital deployment plans, for example I think you've been exploring a second methanol build out at Bishop. Just wondering if the change in the energy backdrop alters your willingness stay short some methanol as an example? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think in that when we're certainly really reviewing options with some of the partners that we've been working with for that investment. And so Kevin we haven't a made decision today on that. I think you've seen methanol prices really move dramatically particularly in Asia and so the Asian dynamic from my personal view you need to sort out just a little bit especially the role that MTO is going to play in the consumption of methanol there. And I think from that then you can back up and get a better sense of what the economics and value equation looks like to produce in U.S. So I would say that that investment is still under consideration. That\u2019s what I was thinking about. If I look beyond that you know lower, if you bake in '15 and say we're 50 forever that challenges fuel methanol more. We've been doing more work of course with all of our partners in China and Indonesia and India and there continues to be a lot of engagement and debate and discussion in that. But I would say that on the surface, Indonesian economics are not quite as strong as they we're, in part because the government has moved away from subsidies of fuel and so there the government bogie is not quite as high as it was. There's still a positive return on it, but it's not as good as it was. I think if you look at other fuel sources that are out there, that move in concert with oil, it still remains a very attractive project. So as we go through this year, I think we will sort out, we will have a better view of the longevity of crude pricing at these levels and I think that could have an impact on future plans for methanol. Kevin McCarthy : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Second question if I may on the financial side, I think you had mentioned in the prepared remarks release last night that you expect your tax rate to dip below 20% in 2015. Probably we could speak to what is driving that and on the balance sheet side? What an appropriate leverage ratio might be? I think you had indicated some deleveraging in the near future and how closer are you getting to your target leverage here? Mark Rohr : So I'll talk about the tax rate first and we didn\u2019t give a pinpoint number just with some of the uncertainty. The geographic shifts to profitability can change that forever, but directly the reason it's going down is through some of this work we're doing with our Pan European headquarter in the Netherlands. And in connection with that, it's changing some of the product flows in the company to a more favorable tax jurisdiction. So that's really the biggest part of driving that change on into 2015. The second part of your question on leverage, we've never really put out specific leverage targets, but what we have said is -- is we do want to continue to strengthen the balance sheet of the company. And I think if you look back at the past three years at what we've been doing, it demonstrates that commitment. I\u2019ll take that kind of in a couple of buckets, one is that level, so we paid down about $230 million of debt and most of that was in this last fourth quarter. If you look at another form of deleveraging is dealing with the underfunding in our pension plans and both at the end of 2012 and at the end of 2014, we made incremental contributions of $100 million in each of those years to bring that obligation down. And at the same time, I think you're aware that we embarked on the termination of our retiree medical plan, which is consistent with what we've seen other companies do and in the end, we founded about $70 million into that but it reduced the liability by a couple $100 million just the way we structured that buy out. And I am pleased to tell you that this past quarter there was another step back on the pension side. So there is a population of employees within that pension obligation that are former employees who have moved on to other companies, but we remain with an obligation to find some level of pension for them. We made an offer to those employees to buy them out and succeeded in getting a group of them to accept that offer, which on a gross basis reduces that pension liability by over $200 million in exchange for about $150 million that came out of the plan. So it didn\u2019t come of the cash that you see on our balance sheet but rather came out of the plan, but again it's another form of working that obligation down and working on deleveraging. So I think in future periods, you'll see us continuing to work that down as part of the overall strategy for cash deployment. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks Kevin. Drew let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Bob. Robert Koort : You guys have been making some reasonable progress on VAE and other ethylene based products. I am wondering in light of the propylene chain falling apart of you're going to suffer maybe some competitive substitution push back there going forward. What are your thoughts on that? Mark Rohr : Yes. There are some. I think Bob that's exactly right. There are some areas where we are seeing that, but Europe and Asia seems to be very -- remains very, very committed to some of the virtues especially in the coatings arena for those molecules. So we're seeing still strong growth there and we're still moving ahead with our expansion in Asia building new VAE plan. Robert Koort : And Mark I guess may be to get away from the near term stuff, you've been there I think a little over three years now and I think when you came in, there was a desire to drive towards a more specialty oriented platform. Just wondering if you might assess where you are in that evolution because it sure seems like the markets is not giving any credit forward, you get a trading multiple that looks more like a pure play commodity stock. You mentioned in your remarks that you won't be able to hold on a raw material relief, which might imply, you haven't high graded the portfolio or maybe your products are more susceptible to some price dislocation. So can you tell us where you are in that journey and what you might have to do to get a rating more appropriate for where you think the portfolio sits? Mark Rohr : Yes. Well it's a great question Bob. When we approach this starting in '12 to enroll deep dive into our business. We really concluded that we had two core capabilities. One was around the material segment, which is about half the portfolio and if you look at the businesses we have there, all the molecules we have and the chemistries we have, there is a real push to mirror chemistry and application to drive that. And we've had tremendous success and so if you draw a circle around Asian materials and a consumer which is also material, you will see really strong growth through that period of time. On the other side, which is technology and technology leverage, we really felt that we weren\u2019t giving a chance to leverage that. I would venture say in 2012 virtually our entire contractual relationships that we had, entire list of those contractual relationships with customers did not give us the ability to further negotiate and fully draw pricing. And we've been working hard to change that and we've had good success changing that in parts of the world, but I would still say we're only about a third of the way there, Bob. So, part of the ability that you saw last year of Celanese driving value, an industry-driving value is that we changed our approach in that industry and conduced ourselves, to be very honest, more like a specialty chemical company. We conducted ourselves a real-time value and real-time pricing. So, I appeal that from a point of view of commerce we're conducting ourselves in a way that's going to reduce our volatility over time and give us much more consistent earnings growth. And we've targeted earnings growth double-digit CAGR, 12% CAGR over like a five-year period. And maintaining that is what's most important to me. And I think in my world that's a reflection of really conducting yourself as if it was specialty. We've not be recognized yet for that. But I'm quite confident we will as time goes on. The last thing I'll mention is as we roll out our -- internally our new strategy and then we're looking at new strategy, the updated version of our strategy looking forward to 2018, its very apparent to all of us that we'll need to bring in more businesses into the portfolio. So M&A is taking a more of a front center effort for us to further build the chain, if you will, both on the C1 side and energy and material side in a way that we can further differentiate ourselves with customers and values that go back to shareholders. Robert Koort : Got it. Thanks. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks Bob. Drew, let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Could you just give us a sense of sort of what the imaginations are that allow 1Q to be flat year-over-year, maybe just sort of talk through the headwinds in the quarter and how the different segments should perform. Mark Rohr : I thought that you are breaking -- you're breaking up a lot there, Vincent. Vincent Andrews : I'm sorry. I was just trying to understand how first quarter of '15 is going to be consistent with first quarter of '14. I assume there are going to be puts and takes between the different segments year-over-year given the headwind. So I was just hoping you could help us reconcile that as we update our models. Mark Rohr : Yeah. I think whether it's just -- I think as we enter '15 we're talking about '15 earnings as we look at it here in the bottom line basis. We think it's going to be fairly consistent what we did in the first quarter of 2014. We're expecting, if I can talk about that some, we're expecting stronger performance in a lot of the businesses like the Acetic Acid Chain and drive Acetyl Chain and ensure materials businesses and that will be offset by cellulosic, which we've talked about in the big inventory yet. This is going to occur -- a lot of that occurs in the first quarter. And so that's how we kind of come to that balance number. Should get a little favourability in tax rate, as Chris mentioned, that will help a bit in there as well. But net of all those things you come in about flat. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, can you mention that M&A is becoming more front-center in your strategic discussion. Do you also talk about the other side of that which would be potentially selling things or making the overall structure of the company different? I mean there's obviously a cross. The chemical industry, there is a lot of debate at many different work oriented companies about pure play or the conglomerate structure or what have you. And you're obviously in a variety of different things. So do you look at sort of your portfolio on some of the parts basis? And do you have any thoughts about -- is it definitely the trigger to be adding versus the running opportunity to subtract or to make things different? Mark Rohr : No. There are opportunities. We've actually attempted some of those, and really from a value equation point of view was the right thing to at the time to take that step. So you shouldn't have a view that we're locked in to only one portfolio. What I will say is that these two cores, when look at from a two core perspective and you set aside the chemistry portfolio of individual businesses, there is lot of combined strength there. And so, we feel good about the two cores, but clearly the pieces of those that at some point of time may better fit somewhere else and we'll be fine with that. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks Vincent. Drew, let's move to the next question and we'll have this be the last series of questions. Operator : Okay. And that question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning. Celanese buys quite a lot of ethylene, my guess is something over 1 billion pounds, is that the right number? And how much of that comes under formulaic pricing and how much of it doesn't? Mark Rohr : That number is -- generically it's in the right range. I'll just put it -- I'll just say that. Jeff Zekauskas : Sure. Mark Rohr : It's in the right range. All of our buys are formulaic. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Then I\u2026 Mark Rohr : We never really buy -- we don't buy on the spot market if that's what you're asking. Jeff Zekauskas : No, no, no. What I meant is that obviously ethylene prices have come down quite a lot. And so, I would think there would be some kind of tailwind that you would experience at least in the beginning of the year. Mark Rohr : Well, I think there are some areas where those molecules go into specialty products. Jeff Zekauskas : Yeah. Mark Rohr : Right? And that creates in itself an opportunity for us. There are other areas where they go into conventional products where that formula and our customer base it\u2019s kind of pass through, if that makes sense. Jeff Zekauskas : Sure. Mark Rohr : So, the ethylene benefit, if it's going to roll to us as we go through this year, a chunk of it, we're going to say, don't see because our customers base business has a tie back to that molecule. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then for my follow-up, I would think you've been seeing or might have a tough year this year. When you sort of size what the equity contribution might be do you size it down 50% or 30% or some number like that, or do you not size it? Mark Rohr : Yeah. No, we do size that. Yeah, as you know, you've been seeing effectively the way that business works is basically its MTBE sale and MTBE has a reasonable correlation to crude. So we do expect and our partners expect that the net back to that venture is going to down. We've sized that in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 potentially. And again, that would be a full year kind of perspective on it. Chris Jensen : Jeff, another thing to keep in mind on that one is we're picking up their numbers on a quarter lag. So just bear that in mind. Jeff Zekauskas : Yes. Mark Rohr : You'll start seeing it in second quarter or whatever is going on. Jeff Zekauskas : Yeah. All right. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Right. Thank you, Jeff. Jon Puckett : Thanks Jeff, and thanks everybody else on the call today. We'll be around for follow-ups later today. Have a great Friday. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Please go ahead. Jon Puckett : Thanks Drew. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2015 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President, Finance. The Celanese Corporation first quarter 2015 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today are and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation\u2019s future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we will field your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks Jon; and good morning to everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments fairly brief and then open the line for your questions. Over the last several years we have driven record earnings by building capability to support our core value generated propositions, the Acetyl Chain and Material Solutions. We\u2019re now taking additional steps to better align all of Celanese in support of these two value drivers. In the Acetyl Chain we created value by leveraging the fully integrated and industry leading technology across an unmatched global platform to supply acetic acid and derivatives. This business is uniquely positioned to rapidly respond to market needs to best support global trade flows in a sort of a very broad array of customers, and in doing so we distanced ourselves from others in this space. In Material Solutions, our foundation of chemistry and polymerization technology is combined with leading application expertise and deep customer engagement to create products and applications for diverse and highly valued end markets. These two business cores are made even more successful by sharing technology, production assets and research resources, allowing us to be more responsive to market needs while operating at lower cost than others. Our growth strategy has been based upon these two value equations since late 2012 and since then we have delivered double digit year-over-year quarterly earnings growth for eight over the last ten quarters. So, organizing more completely around these cores is the next logical step to bring further gains and efficiency and higher earnings for our shareholders. Now let\u2019s move on to consolidated results. I am very pleased to report first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share representing a 34% earnings growth sequentially and 29% growth year-over-year. This record quarterly performance also reflect the swift actions taken to help address the impact of raw material deflation, the precipitous falling of foreign exchange rates as well as anemic growth in some of our end markets. Our teams did a tremendous job of maintaining the pricing in the face of significantly lower raw material cost. We also successfully offset a significant decline in the euro to dollar exchange rate with productivity programs as well as lower energy cost, and we expanded our adjusted EBIT margin to 24.1%, a quarterly record and an increase of more than 600 basis points from the prior quarter and the prior year. I\u2019d like to thank all of our global teams who worked so hard and deliver these results amidst a challenging business environment. As we look to the remainder of 2015 some of these headwinds we outlined last quarter have increased. For instance the euro has weakened roughly another $0.07 to $0.08 since January. We also expect lower MTBE prices of Ibn Sina joint venture will impact affiliate earnings for the remainder of 2015. However, our building the first quarter to mitigate these and other headwinds to strong commercial performance along with specific productivity initiatives gives us confidence and we can manage this volatility going forward. And as a result we have increased our 2015 outlook for adjusted earnings to a range of $5.60 to $5.90 per share. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jon for Q&A Jon Puckett : Thanks Mark. We\u2019ve got a lot of folks on the line. We want to get to as many questions as we can, so please limit your questions to one question and one follow up and Drew, I will turn it over to you now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] At this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Just two quick ones. Can you quantify your total FX assumption that you're looking as a headwind for this year? And have you seen any noticeable acceleration in any regions in your end markets? Chris Jensen : On the currency for the remainder of the year it\u2019s probably it\u2019s more in the $0.60 to $0.70 range and that would the assumption driving that would be \u20ac1 with $1.05 for the second, third and fourth quarters. And then, Mark you want to cover the acceleration in end markets. Mark Rohr : Yes I\u2019d say that\u2019s a hard one Laurence. We are seeing certainly Europe is doing better and we\u2019re seeing some enthusiasm on the part of European car manufacturers and it\u2019s a pretty strong growth. I think Germany was up 7% year-over-year for instance and although it\u2019s a pretty strong growth. We\u2019ve seen China come back a bit from what was a very anemic first two months of the year and that\u2019s been encouraging as well. So I\u2019d call up those two areas, Lawrence. Laurence Alexander : Okay, thanks. And just to clarify the FX hedge. What was the FX hitting Q1 then? Mark Rohr : 15 to 20. Chris Jensen : Yes $15 million to $20 million, so that\u2019s it. Laurence Alexander : Okay, thanks. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Laurence. Drew, let\u2019s move to the next. Operator : The next question comes from Duffy Fisher from Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fisher : Yes, good morning congratulations guys. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Duff. Duffy Fisher : The thing that investors have been focused on over the last quarter is the tow business and kind of the destocking. Volumes seem to have come down about what you guys were projecting. Did the underlying business perform as you would have thought in that environment? And what kind of signals are you getting from your end customers about how that destocking is going and when we might see that abate? Mark Rohr : Yes Duffy great question. We communicated a lot in January of course end of last year as we ended last year and into January, about this destocking initiative and the results that we have seen in January are exactly as I mean as close as you can be exact, but best could reflect the outlook given to us by our customers. And so we feel pretty good about that, and I think that\u2019s consistent with our destocking initiatives based on what we knew about their end markets. If you roll it forward we\u2019re seeing some improvement as we enter into the second quarter which again was consistent with improvement in terms of our orders, which is consistent \u2013 what they had told us. So we continue to predict that we are going to have this first half impact, the first quarter being the most dramatic impact and get back to more normalized rates as we hit the back half of the year. Duffy Fisher : Great, thanks. And then assuming let\u2019s just say we hit the midpoint of the guidance for the year that $5.75 and then look into 2016, is that a good base line into building into next year or might there be some kind of transitory spread benefit in that $5.75 that we need to mitigate a little bit as we get into next year? Mark Rohr : Yes I\u2019m not sure we have the answer to that question Duffy. Chris Jensen : I think Duffy you are asking about puts and takes as we would enter next year\u2026 Duffy Fisher : Yes moving into next year. Chris Jensen : And you know as we outlined at the beginning of this year, we tried to be as real transparent about what headwinds we would have. And so, Mark, I'll let you clean this up but wherever we end the year is going to be a basis to how we build the next year. And so, you know Duffy and we\u2019ll try to highlight what we think is a headwind and what we think might be either a tailwind or an action item that we are pursuing to try to drive growth. Mark Rohr : Yes I think Duffy I would \u2013 not going up too far on this, but I would expect 2016 as a lot better year than 2015 if you, then we\u2019ll have resolved methanol will be, you know that would be fully behind us and fully functioning. And it looks like with the steps we\u2019ve taken that that headwind as we let folks know last year will have been mitigated as we get into next year for the most part you would expect that there is some inflations starting to occur and if this year is marked by deflation that will be back side to that and so there will be some inflation. Inflation is probably good for us and we\u2019ll be operating more fully around these two cores which is going to generate a lot of new opportunity for us. So my belief is it\u2019s a good foundation and my belief is there will be a lot more tailwinds and headwinds as we go towards 2016. Duffy Fisher : Terrific. Thank you guys. Jon Puckett : Thanks, Duffy. Drew, let\u2019s move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the new segmentation, the Materials Solutions and Acetyl Chain segmenting I understand the customer focus aspect of it for the Materials Solutions part. But I guess it appears that all four of these assets are pretty well integrated into the Acetyl Chain. So, I guess how did you decide on where to make the cut in terms of say, putting Industrial Specialties in the Acetyl Chain and then maybe keeping consumer and/or AEM out of it, maybe is my first question? Mark Rohr : Well I think what we really have spent our time looking at and we started this actually in 2012 and started practising in 2013 is the ability to lever the interconnected relationships to the raw material chain upto the customers. And we found that there is a lot more leverage the closer you are to earth, wind and fire than there is with the further down you get. So, that kind of runs not completely but it runs a lot of its course through the emulsions business pretty well. So that became the nature of drawing a circle around that and we actually drew that circle John a couple of years ago and we\u2019ve been working at. But what we didn\u2019t do is fully commit ourselves to our an organisational alignment that really would have supported that and that\u2019s the process we are going to now and that\u2019s a lot of unique value options between ourselves and our customers won\u2019t do that. John McNulty : Okay. And then just as the follow-up, it sounds like the organizational alignment, it all makes sense the way you're laying it out. Can you talk to the physical alignment of the plants? And do they work in a similar fashion where the Industrial segment and the Acetyl businesses basically kind of all lock together and the Materials Solutions businesses may not be locked to them? Is that how we should think about it or not? Mark Rohr : No you have they are not totally locked. We have some places we have integrated complexes where they are fully integrated and contain all aspects of our portfolio of businesses. Generally speaking when you get past the big Acetyl complexes we have remote plants in the industrial specialities area around the world. So there is a logistics component associated with this, but that\u2019s also a benefit of the full integration because we quite often would sell products to competitors of ours in these downstream markets. So, we are now ranging swaps, we are now changing that trade flow in a favourable way that\u2019s adding value. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much. Jon Puckett : Thanks John. Drew, let\u2019s move on Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Mark, on AM, can you discuss your ability to retain more of this pricing in Q2 and beyond as raws have dropped here? And of the $0.30-$0.35 decline you highlighted for Q2 versus Q1 would that be perhaps, two-thirds in AI and one-third in AM? Mark Rohr : Yes so clearly the more speciality oriented the business, the more opportunity you have to retaining margins. So I there is you know it\u2019s never easy but I think directionally retaining raw materials and engineered materials is easier material segments is easier for us to do than just necessarily in Acetyl Chain. We have some linked quite often with pricing on raw materials. So I think we\u2019ll go a good job retaining it there. If you look at the drop quarter to quarter, Chris you want to comment on that, that $0.30. Chris Jensen : From what you \u2013 as you go Q1 to Q2, the Q1 to Q2 if you think about the big movers there, so we\u2019ll have better cellulose derivatives volumes like we\u2019ve told you moving towards a nice back half of the year. There\u2019s the even scene of ventures, so this shows us and the engineered materials segment it\u2019s MTBE and Methanol the earnings you can think of the earnings of that venture being fairly co-related with Brent Crude and we actually reported on a three month lag, so you are going to see a pretty decent size decline on then in the second quarter going through the remainder of the year assuming that Brent stays kind of in this range where it is. So you\u2019ll have a little bit further currency headwind going in Q1 to Q2 as well and I think you are going to expect the corporate spend that shows up in that other segment to be higher in Q2 than it is in Q1. Mark Rohr : So it starts at roughly two thirds, the Acetyl Chain one third the material chain. David Begleiter : And Mark just quickly now that we have these two cores, the natural question is do they belong together longer term given that they will be valued by definitely by investors eventually, how do you think about that situation? Mark Rohr : Well I think you know what I\u2019d say we\u2019ve been practising this for a while and we see ways to unlock more and more value. But with our objective here and we are being very vocal about that is we expect that to be fully realised \u2013 the value of this to be fully realized by investors. And so we are going to work hard to get that full value realization out there and have the investors benefit from that as fully and completely as it is humanly possible. So we are driven to do that David. And so we hope that as we go through this process that will start to happen and certainly it\u2019s our expectation to continue to drive earnings the way we have been and in that process reduce volatility as well, so we are committed to see that that value is unlocked and realized David. David Begleiter : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks David. Drew, let\u2019s move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yes good morning and great start to the year fellows. Mark Rohr : Thanks Frank. Frank Mitsch : On the productivity actions you talked about last quarter about $60 million and now you are just talking about an incremental $40 million to $50 million obviously seems rather high. Can you give us some examples of that and you know what segments we should be monitoring to see those productivity savings? Chris Jensen : Yes Frank, that\u2019s I guess what I would say is look at all of them because they are all working on it. This is a deep focus initiative where all of our general managers and all of our functional leaders are engaged. Mark is personally involved driving this from the top, lots of iterations or discussions on what we do differently to support this core business model going forward. So you are going to be able as you move through time here to point anywhere and see some benefits from these initiatives. Frank Mitsch : Right. So across the board is how we should think about that nothing more focussed on this segment or that segment. All right fine, and then in the release you talked about pricing in the consumer specialities business being down 2% sequentially and also referencing a legacy flake contract having an impact there, can you talk about what\u2019s going on from a raw material and end product pricing perspective in that business and essentially you know prices are sort I guess typically early in the year and that\u2019s it, so we should be thinking about pricing year-over-year being off for the balance of 2015, correct in this segment. Chris Jensen : I think that\u2019s right. This is a price mix combination here and so a good chunk of that is mix, you know the effect of the legacy supply arrangement we have and that arrangement is near the end of its, of its term and it kicked up a little bit higher volume this year and so that was a delta then year-over-year more negative. Pricing was offset at the end of last year and we kind of already commented on that so you are not going to see pricing change Frank in this segment as you go forward. And there\u2019s really not a correlation between pricing and raw materials in this business. So there\u2019s still opportunities for us to drive a little bit of raw material value enhancement we think as we go through this year that will show up. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Chris Jensen : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Well thanks Frank. And Drew, let\u2019s go ahead to the next question. Operator : Next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [Indiscernible] calling in for Kevin. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. So you\u2019ve made good progress on free cash flow and deleveraging. Should we continue to see deleveraging trend to continue and if not how might your capital deployment plans change? Chris Jensen : So like we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019re highly focussed on strengthening our balance sheet overtime and if you look back to 2014 we did a lot that year. We returned over $400 million of cash to shareholders. We took debt down by somewhere around $230 million and we also put $100 million into this U.S. pension plan which is not fully funded. That\u2019s what we did last year. That was a pretty high amount of cash outflow to use for that and what was a really good strong cash flow here so it made a lot of sense. We are focussed on doing those things going forward. Chris Jensen : So like we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we\u2019re highly focussed on strengthening our balance sheet over time, and if you look back to 2014 we did a lot that year. We returned over $400 million of cash to shareholders. We took debt down by somewhere around $230 million, and we also put $100 million into this U.S. pension plan, which is not really funded. That\u2019s what we did last year. That was a pretty high amount of cash outflow to use for that in what was a really good strong cash flow year, so it made a lot of sense. We are focussed on doing those things going forward. If you go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, right now a lot of our cash is -- really almost all of our cash is overseas. And in order to use that cash for U.S. purposes similar to other multinational companies, we have high cash needs in the U.S. returning cash to shareholders, debt reduction, pensions, a lot of cash needs here. So that makes it difficult to do as much this year as we did last year, not to say that we are not working on ways to do that and we will find ways to do that, but I think you can expect that activity generally to be a little lower this year. Wei Vang : Great, thanks. And a follow up on your Bishop project. Just wondering how the estimated cost of that would compare to your project at Clear Lake? Chris Jensen : Yes, so it would be more expensive because there is not as much onsite equipment, and the utility systems that we could easily use, so there\u2019s more investment in base facilities in Bishop, but not a lot. So, I think it\u2019s probably -- I\u2019m speaking to you a little bit out of tongue here, a bit of tongue and cheek because we haven\u2019t finalized that work. But you should think in terms of 10% to 15% or 10% to 20%, not 30% or 40% or 50% if that makes sense. But there is a lot of work yet to do on that. We do have the permit applications underway, but to be very honest, we really want the energy market to settle out a bit. We want methanol markets to settle out a bit, so you shouldn\u2019t have a view that we are going to start construction on this thing soon. But we do have a great relationship with Mitsui, we are excited about the partnership here to really evaluate it and we are also very pleased with the long term supply arrangement that we\u2019ve entered into with them over a five-year period, so that should give you some scope or some of the considerations we've got on whether we build or not. Wei Vang : Great. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Thanks Wei Vang. Drew, let\u2019s go to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Bob. Robert Koort : Mark, could you talk a little bit, I guess there was some anxiety maybe as you\u2019ve shut down some of your European assets and actually were shipping into the region that you have transactional challenges you know beyond just the translational issues of currency. Can you give us an update of how that\u2019s progressed, and then secondly, it looked like you rejiggered a little bit of your agreement with Mitsui at Clear Lake, can you just tell us what the particulars and basis for that was? Chris Jensen : Bob, I\u2019ll take part of that first question, and then I\u2019ll let Mark talk and whatever he\u2019d like to say about our plans in Europe, but I think you\u2019re talking about transaction flows and how that flows through currency. So when we talk about euro exposure, at least three quarters of that is related to that issue where we have production in the U.S. Also, you have dollar based costs and then you are selling a lot of this product in Europe, so you have Euro revenues. So it\u2019s not any different than we have described it before. That right now is our business model, and as you\u2019ve seen in spite of having that tremendous headwind in the Euro, the businesses have done a really nice job of these productivity initiatives and their pricing to offset that stuff, but that model is probably here to stay for the foreseeable quarters in terms of the disparity between where we produce and where we sell. Just that you know, there some offsets to that elsewhere in the business where you have U.S. dollar based revenues and local currency costs and we've actually gotten a little bit help in some other instances to offset some of this, but the big number is the euro. Mark Rohr : Yes, Bob, most of these products that were moved from the U.S. to Europe are not produced in Europe by anyone, and certainly not produced in the EU by anyone. And so, everybody has got the same incentive, I think to -- roughly the same incentive to moderate the FX impact. We pushed really hard in the first quarter to do that and we had really good success. And to be honest, we've not priced in lot of that going forward in this perspective we put out for the year, in part because we did lose volume in some areas and we didn't see as much support by some as we like to see. So, we're going to continue pushing and hopefully others will do that and that would represent some upside for us for the year if we can be pretty successful over that. With regard to our production facilities in Europe, yeah, we continue to work. We have phenomenal team in Europe and phenomenal facilities in Europe, some are disadvantages or a main disadvantage even with the change and the favorable change from a European point of view in FX in energy, so we're going to continue to look at what the right footprint is in Europe and work with our employees there to address that over time. Robert Koort : Anything else on Mitsui? Mark Rohr : Mitsui, I think, well the nature of the question is, we have entered this agreement. We're excited about it. We think it gives us access to competitive methanol for the next five years, and that completely \u2013does not completely eradicate the headwind, but we'll take a little bite out of it, but we think over time. Robert Koort : Great. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Bob. Jon Puckett : Thanks Bob. Let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. Just kind of a broader question on capital allocation; now that you're buying a lot of the remaining volume that belongs to Mitsui out of the plant that you guy JV'd and you're thinking about building another one. I guess I'm just trying to understand the point of the JV structure, and I guess maybe I tie that -- you know you've got this $850 million offshore and that's helping your tax rate to be low, so how do we think about decisions you're making on capital allocation versus keeping the tax rate low and how has that all come together? Mark Rohr : Vincent, I'll go back to the Mitsui. So that's a U.S. based venture. We've made decision to build one plant. That plant should be operating around October of this year. And we're also entered into a long-term agreement with Mitsui to evaluate the opportunity to build the second plant in Bishop. We haven't made a decision to build that, we\u2019re set to evaluate that. And as part of that, we have an agreement to -- supply agreement from the plant at Clear Lake to make up some of the balance -- to make up all the balance we have of methanol. So that's what we have in play. And so, you should look at this as an announcement we're getting ready to invest another $4 million in Bishop, we have not made that decision yet. Chris Jensen : Let me take a crack at the broader capital allocation question as it relates to where our business is and where is our cash. This situation that we're in right now with most of our cash being overseas, it's not new. That's what happens in a multinational business model. And across time, we have figured out ways to deal with that so that it has not been a constraint in terms to our ability to invest where it made sense for the business to invest. And I expect that we're going to be able to continue to figure that out in the future. So I wouldn't want you to have a view that says we cannot invest in the U.S. because that cash is overseas, that wouldn't be the way that we look at that. Vincent Andrews : Yes. I guess my question is really just more like should we be expecting your tax rate to go up over time as you need to repatriate future income, not necessarily the money that's over there. And I guess I just was thinking on the Clear Lake facility, you know you're now paying Mitsui, for you know presumably a price that's above cost when you could have just been taking that product across yourself if you just own the plants, I just was really trying to understand why the continued desire to JV? Mark Rohr : Let me take the tax rate question first, and what will happen over time. The tax rate is going to go up over time, because we plan to make more money over time and that always pressures your tax rate, because your marginal tax rate is higher than your average tax. I don't expect in the near term to being repatriating cash and taking a tax hit in order to do that. So, I'm going to separate what you see in tax rate movements from having to do with the cost of repatriating money. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Vincent. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks, Vincent. Let's move to the next one, Drew. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : First question I've got is when you look at your other activities line; I think it was a cost of something like $17 million in this quarter versus $30 million last year, and the number can really bounce around. And I think your depreciation charges this quarter were 60 \u2013 I think your D&A were $67 million versus $75 million than year ago. Can you explain some of those positive variances? Mark Rohr : On other activities, are you referring to the segment is that what you're looking at? Jeff Zekauskas : Yes, that's exactly right. Mark Rohr : Yes. So, just as reminder, what's in there, its corporate costs, corporate functions, it has our global pension interest expense, the return on assets for the $2 billion plus that we have invested in the pension plan. So there are numbers of things there that can make that volatile quarter-to-quarter. So what is it that you saw in the first quarter? So I would say first as we've talked about, we're driving productivity hard and that relates to the functional spend that you see there and that's reflected in the result in the first quarter, but there is also some timing on some favorable items that impacted that. So, while you'll see some volatility quarter-to-quarter, I think generally you can look for this year and expect that to be somewhere in the mid-20s. Part of that is the timing of our annual merit increases across the company, it happens here in the second quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And if you could also\u2026 Mark Rohr : Can you ask the question on depreciation again if you wouldn't mind? Jeff Zekauskas : Yes, exactly. Yes. I think that depreciation in the quarter was 67, depreciation and amortization was 67 versus 75 in the year-ago period, and maybe that was tilted down by $3 million less than amortization costs, but why should your depreciation go down so much? Mark Rohr : So, I don't have the details in front of me, but part of that is currency. So your entire European assets base is being depreciated and transferred into U.S. dollars at a different exchange rate? Jeff Zekauskas : Right. And for my follow-up, just conceptually, is it roughly the case that your adjusted gross profit in the first quarter was more or less equal to your adjusted gross profit in the fourth quarter and that the difference in earnings between the fourth and the first quarter are all the different overhead items through SG&A? Is that roughly correct? Mark Rohr : I don't think I follow what you mean by adjusted gross profit. Jeff Zekauskas : In other words if you look at your gross profit, ex non-recurring items, whatever that absolute number was, I thought it was roughly $382 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, and I saw that in this quarter it was roughly $383, is that correct that those two numbers are more or less the same in your opinion or are they very different? Mark Rohr : Yes. I don't have a reconciliation sitting in front of me because we generally don't look at adjusted gross profit. We do that at an EBIT level. But just to remind you what is the driver in general behind gross profit here is the margin expansion that we've had quarter on quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Drew, let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead. PJ Juvekar : Yes. Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, PJ. Chris Jensen : Good morning. PJ Juvekar : So, you had a big benefit from lower raw materials in this first quarter especially in Acetyls. So, how much of this benefit is sustainable if Acetyl chain is running at 70% utilization globally. And then do you think that Acetyls have sort of decoupled from methanol, and as methanol come down Acetyl did not come down as much, and that's driving the profitability. So can you just talk about sort of that long-term outlook? Mark Rohr : Yes. I think, PJ, it\u2019s a hard question to answer directly. I think there, if you look at what we do is we try to decouple it all the time. We work very hard to move our products in the markets and get a proper return for those products. And so, we have every time as you know decoupled our contracts and given ourselves more freedom to price and you've seen some of the benefit of that in this first quarter. What we are always dependent on though is for others to be thoughtful about how they price, and generally I would say that well, I'd say some mixed bag right now. So, if the industry doesn't try and doesn't care about driving margin, it will be hard for us to maintain that. However, we've been running in 70% capacity utilization for a long time as an industry and you've seen the ability of the industry to drive higher and higher pricing, so my kind of gut is PJ it\u2019s going to be somewhere between replication and nothing as we go through the rest of this year. PJ Juvekar : Okay. Thank you. And then, on this new methanol launch in Bishop, what's the rationale there? Do you think that methanol is going to be tight and you'll rather control your own supply? Is that the rationale or is it just that? Mark Rohr : Well the rationale is always just to make money PJ, and what we're trying to say here is we've entered into an \u2013 it\u2019s hard to fully evaluate these projects. And so, we've got a great partner in Mitsui who has the same long-term invested interest as ours, which the last think I would do is invest money and not get a great return on it. So we put together a phenomenal project in Clear Lake that is going to be the -- we think the most cost competitive methanol plant. Certainly, it will be the most cost competitive methanol plant in U.S., and one of the most cost competitive in the world when you look at it from a logistic point of view. That's going to be a phenomenal investment for us and for Mitsui. And so, what we've agreed to do is to ask ourselves can we replicate that in Bishop. That's what this announcement says. It doesn't say, we've decided to replicate it. It says that we're going devote ourselves to looking at it, and as part of that process, we entered into five-year agreement, and keywords there, five-year agreement to take some of the volume that Mitsui has out of the Bishop plant and roll it into the Celanese system, and we're doing that in a competitive fashion. So, we want to work with Mitsui. We want to see if we can develop a project, but we are not committed to it, and we would not do it unless it makes sense, economic sense in a very strong way. PJ Juvekar : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay. Thanks, PJ. Drew, let's move on to the next question. Let's have this be the last series of questions. Operator : And the last series of questions will come from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : In your guidance, you guys talked about the methanol headwinds being $0.10 to $0.15 lower than what you guys had originally focused. So now probably part of the reason obviously is lower natural gas prices, but you know in this guidance, what you baking in, in terms of methanol prices? Mark Rohr : Well, we are generally based on lower natural gas, and that's how we ran it. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough, so because it's\u2026 Mark Rohr : From a raw material input point of view, remember we gave a range of $75 million to $125 million. And then last, we said, it will be towards lower end of that and now we're saying we're going to be $20 million or so below that, but that's all being driven by natural gas prices and that could be a little worse than that or a little better. Sure, I mean, it could be, but we're \u2013 that how we're doing, just raw material based. Hassan Ahmed : And are you thinking about sort of methanol kind of being relatively flat with where we are right now? Mark Rohr : Yes. I think so. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. Mark Rohr : And if you take it, we're just taking the marginal difference, so I think that's right. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. And as a follow-up, another thing that you talked about on the Clear Lake side of things was that you've increase the staffing numbers obviously to get the plant up and running on time, and you talked about how there\u2019d be some higher costs. Now you know some of these newer facilities that have come online, I mean we've seen inflation anywhere between 10% to 30%; so just purely ballpark, is it closer to 10% inflation that we\u2019ll see less than that, closer to 30%, just any guidance around that? Mark Rohr : It's closer to 10%. What we're seeing is \u2013 we're seeing in pipe fitting and welding crafts. We're seeing an operational of about 80% of efficiency, so that's about 80% of the level of efficiency that we would expect out of those crafts, and so you compensate that by having more men and women there doing the work. And that\u2019s one of many many trades and one of the many many systems, so we think a 10% range is certainly what we believe and that\u2019s what we are rolling out internally as we look at it. Hassan Ahmed : Super. Thank you so much. Chris Jensen : Thank you. Jon Puckett : Okay, thanks Hassan and Drew, I\u2019ll let you wrap it up, folks thanks for your time this morning and we\u2019ll be around for calls later today. Have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we will begin with some introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we'll field your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments brief and open the line for your questions. Our complementary value drivers, Materials Solutions and Acetyl Chain, helped us deliver our eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth and our seventh consecutive quarterly earnings record. During the quarter, we continued to align along our two cores by appointing Scott Sutton as President of Materials Solutions Group and Pat Quarles as President of the Acetyl Chain. I'm really pleased to have these two accomplished leaders in place, who will enhance our commercial and operating discipline and help lead our growth initiatives. Now, let's move on to consolidated results. It's a pleasure to report second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share, representing a 7% growth year-over-year and 8% lower than the first quarter. For the company as a whole, second quarter revenue was $1.5 billion, 2% higher than the first quarter on higher volumes in both cores, which was partially offset by slightly lower pricing. Consolidated adjusted EBIT was $325 million, realizing 22% margin, 340 basis points higher year-over-year. Sequentially, margin decreased 210 basis points. Second quarter free cash flow was another quarterly record at $176 million, driven by strong earnings and disciplined working capital management, putting us well on track to generate a second consecutive record for annual free cash flow, all-in-all a great quarter. As we look for the remainder of 2015, we are confident in our unique ability to drive value across both cores, continued success with productivity initiatives and growing success in new product introductions. So we are increasing our outlook for earnings to a range of $5.70 to $6 per share for 2015. Now, before we move to Q&A, I want to let you know we are planning on hosting an Investor Day this fall, and we'll get back to you with specific date and location shortly. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Mark. Keith, let's turn it over for Q&A. And I just want to ask everyone to have one question and one follow-up and limited to that so we can get to as many questions as possible. Go ahead, Keith. Operator : Okay. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning, guys and congrats on the nice quarter. Mark, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the filter business. Obviously, we've gone through some destocking and a couple of quarters ago it was difficult for you to kind of see into what the inventory levels were like particularly around China. One, obviously volumes feel like they're a little bit better now, but how do you see things playing out the rest of this year and in next year? And do you feel better about your absolute ability to see what's happening in China today versus, say, six months or nine months ago? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Duffy. Thanks for the question. As we entered the year, we shared what we had picked up and learned from our partners over there. And since then, the business has performed as they have said it would. As we look to the rest of the year, to be perfectly honest though, we don't have as much clarity exactly what the 300 million Chinese smokers are doing over there. So the consumptive behaviors and what the impact is on the inventory, honestly I just can't say. What we expect is that when I kind of look through that, the trends in smoking are not changing that much. And we think that on a year-over-year basis, we'll be able to drive earnings in this business. But regarding the second half, just exactly what it looks like, I can't say. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. And then on AEM, we are getting some early indications that the Chinese auto production is slowing down. One, can you remind us how much leverage does AEM have to that Chinese auto business? And then two, what have you guys seen, or what would you expect the next couple of quarters from the Chinese auto business for AEM? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the Chinese auto business clearly is slowing down. Our overall exposure to that segment though is pretty small. We've had great growth but it's from a pretty small base. So as we look at what we've done over the last year, Duffy, I'll put it in perspective, we had just unbelievably great growth in that segment in our penetration of autos. And we found ourselves growing at a multiple of that market price, three times that market. We expect that to continue. And so I think subtle movements in the market in China, right now I think they're forecast to be down 1 million units. We don't think it's got a material impact on our business. Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thanks, guys. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Duffy. Keith, let's move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. And that comes from John McNulty from Credit Suisse. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So when we look at 2015, you had two kind of large hiccups coming in, the cigarette destock and the methanol kind of hole that you're in the process of filling. I guess it looks like, maybe, the methanol hole may have been a little less deep just because of pricing and maybe the fiber business, it seems like it maybe held up a little bit better than expected in the second quarter. So I guess, when you think about the sequencing from 2015 to 2016, I think you had originally said $0.25 roughly or $0.25 to $0.30 for each of those holes. How has that changed as we're looking to 2016 now versus 2015? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let's start with methanol which is an easier one to talk about. We continue to find ways to push that project forward in spite of the impact that rains have had on us in the construction. We expect to be online and running, as we hit October of this year. Methanol price has come up a little bit and natural gas prices a little bit. So I think every time we talk to you, we pull back a bit that annualized impact. So this year, that number is somewhere in the $50 million range. I don't think it'll be lower than that, but I expect it to be lower than $60 million. And depending on how you cut it, I think it's certainly lower than that next year. So I believe the numbers that we threw out last time are probably still appropriate. When you look at cellulose derivatives, we're quite confident we'll grow profit year-over-year in that business. We're taking a number of steps to further improve our cost profile in that business, and we're expecting volume growth in that business as well. So I think those numbers we put out earlier that you've quoted are pretty good. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then just one last question. With regard to \u2013 it looks like you had some continued raw material relief. There may have been some puts and takes. It seemed like the spread between \u2013 certainly at least back of the envelope, it seems like the spread between pricing versus kind of some of the raw material moves seemed to be wider. So it looks like your ability to maybe maintain price or hold price seems to be a little bit better than maybe we expected. Can you kind of walk us through what might be driving that at this point? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, in a broad sense, we have continued to work that \u2013 our pricing initiatives and programs across all the entire portfolio. We've had good success in materials, I think offsetting the impacts there. To be honest, we've actually had good success in the Acetyl Chain as well, although the impact of ethylene rapid increase in China in particular kind of smacked us in the face a bit this quarter. So I would say that without getting into each product and each line within each product, the team is really focused on making sure that we are not victimized by negative swings in raw materials. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that. And to the extent we can, we're driving margins even higher when raws fall in our businesses. So net-net, I would expect pricing to be a favorable tailwind for us as we enter the second half of the year. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks very much. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Let me just add a little bit to that, down at the business level. The material space has done a really good job of following that. I mean if you go in and strip out the equity earnings from the base business and look at that trend, last year Q2, this year Q1, this year Q2, it's a very strong story of what they've been able to do there. And just to elaborate more on Mark's comment on acetyls, like we told you, this currency headwind year-over-year, if you look at a full-year basis, is just massive. And you combine that with that methanol challenge and you combine it with the nice margins that were there in VAM last year for various reasons and look at what that business is doing with price this year, they're doing a tremendous job of covering up a lot of these headwinds. While, year-on-year, your kind of headline earnings number would be down on that business, when you peel that apart, it's very strong performance. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, John. Keith, let's move on to the next question. Operator : All right. Thank you and that comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Could you talk a bit about what Scott and Pat will be doing differently or incremental to sort of what you've had in place in the three years that you've been CEO? Maybe you can talk about this at your Analyst Day in the fall, but just trying to get a sense of sort of where this is headed? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Vincent, we've talked a lot about the ability to lever throughout that chain. I think we've tried to share without giving absolute specifics that we've been constrained, as a corporation, our ability to do that vis-\u00e0-vis the contract positions that we had taken long term in that business, and we're starting to unwind those contract positions to give us greater flexibility. That started with acetic acid and is now moving through the other derivatives, though we're simply, in a broad sense, Vincent, getting the ability to price and move our products in the marketplace as it makes sense to get a return on capital that we think is warranted for these businesses. What Pat and Scott will be doing? Of course, Scott Richardson has been doing that for a while, but what Pat brings is a broader global perspective. I think with different products, it really helps us think through how we drive value in this chain. And they're going to be continuing to do that. You could see some further steps to drive productivity in that business as we go forward. Things like shutting down the pilot plant for ethanol, which is a good move, also benefits us from a productivity point of view there. So you'll see those guys working both the top line and the cost position of this business as we look forward and most importantly driving pricing. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just as a follow-up in your emulsion polymers business, and you talked about 6% volume growth sequentially. Can you talk about why it was so strong that seems better than what I see the paint and coatings guys doing? And how much was it up year-over-year and just any context around that would be helpful? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Vincent, what was the last question on the year-over-year? Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just how much was volume up year-over-year? You said 6% sequentially, I believe, in your comments. I'm just curious what that compares against in the year-ago period and just sort of why that's so strong? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Yeah. Yeah. I'll get to the year-over-year, but, Mark, you want to just cover the... Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, that's the first part of the question. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Okay. Yeah, Vincent, what we've got with what's going on in engineering materials is really a deep focus on projects that are opportunities and are going to drive value for the business. And one thing that Scott Sutton has brought to that business is an increased focus on the opportunities in the pipeline that are true opportunities with a customer that is aligned with us on the value that we're creating. And that's something that he's really gotten the whole organization moving in one direction on. And we've talked a lot about launches in that business and needing to launch about a thousand new products or applications annually, and that launch means to have a purchase order from a customer. And that's the real focus that Scott has brought to the businesses, less just ideation and a lot more opportunity focus. And so that's part of the reason why we've been able to drive such good results in that business. Mark, do you want to add anything to that? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'm sorry, Vincent. The person I thought you were talking about is Scott Richardson and Pat working together. The thing I'll talk about both of these guys that really means a lot to me is that they really focus on return on capital. And so we're really driving all of our business decisions to make sure that we're continuing to push the ROIC in this corporation, and these guys bring a heightened sense to that. So each incremental step, every decision we make, we're debating and discussing that. And I think the power within that will show over time as we continue to drive returns and free cash flow out of this business. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: And Vincent, on the volumes year-over-year, it's pretty consistent. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: You bet. Thanks. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Keith, let's move to the next question. Operator : Thank you and it comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, David. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Good morning, David. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Mark, can you just walk us through globally acetic acid and VAM fundamentals? How you see the back half developing tightness or not tightness? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, in general sense, I think the industry is operating as it has been for a while, David, in the high 70%, low 80% capacity utilization, depending on how you do the math. When you look at it from a consumptive point of view, a lot of the world's acetic acid produced is consumed within China, maybe as much as 50% in some way. So the capacity utilization is largely a function of what's going on within China. And we've seen, in China, really pretty weak fundamentals across all industrial chemicals through this year. And we don't necessarily see that changing, David. There're some trends that would indicate to me that volume is picking up in the coatings arena and some of the derivatives, and we've seen some benefit of that in our business. And we're seeing some benefits from a marginal point of view in raws there. But we expect just on the acid basis for the global consumption to remain pretty much as it has been which is very modest growth year-over-year. And we don't see anything fundamentally is going to change that short term. On the VAM side, VAM can be impacted a lot by dramatic swings in ethylene, and we certainly saw that in China this last quarter with ethylene margins at maybe four times normal in that region and that put a short-term slam into that business. That's already reversing itself. So I think VAM margins will be increasing as we go through the year and going forward. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. And Mark, just on AEM in the base business, you've had an exceptional first half of the year, if it's just operating profit. Can that be sustained in terms of both margins and dollars in terms of the momentum in the back half of the year? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, if you look beyond, you get some elements of seasonality in there, David. So classically, the materials business show a pretty weak fourth quarter \u2013 pretty weak December, November. And so I think if I kind of take that seasonality out, I'll say yeah. I mean, in a broad sense, this business, we're going through step changes of improvement in the business. Jon had mentioned the new product introductions. We have a machine that's really working and employees are energized. And we put out a high water mark of a thousand per year. And we think we'll press that this year, which is not quite 2x but virtually 2x what we've done ever in our past. So yeah, I think the machine has changed. And in this first half, again with a little bit of seasonality thrown into the back half of the year, is indicative of the kind of growth that we'd expect out of that business. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Very good. Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks a lot, David. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, David. Keith, let's move to the next question. Operator : And that is Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, folks. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Good morning. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, Mark, just wanted to say kudos on bringing Pat Quarles onboard. I had an opportunity to work a fair amount with him in the past, and a very solid individual. Wanted to talk about use of cash. You highlighted in the release \u2013 I don't know if it was under your commentary or Chris' commentary \u2013 the lowest net debt in company history. So that begs the question, you did mention some level of share buyback, consistent 2015 with 2014. What else can we look to Celanese to do in terms of its cash position? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're trying to build and we've been working this, as you know Frank, over the last couple of years, really a commercial model that generates a lot of free cash flow and does that in a reproducible fashion. And Celanese has been beat up a bit in the past for being dependent on China and other things like that. And you can't look at our data today and say that any of that is still true anymore. This machine will run and we can run it without regard for these subtle influxes or subtle movements in regional economies around the world. Our priorities have stayed the same, which is to say we kind of march through from investments in the business to having a sustainable dividend program to bolt-on kind of acquisitions to big acquisitions. We remain focused in trying to find the right bolt-on properties that are out there and do that in a way that it is instantly accretive to all the returns that we all care about, and I just want you to know that's real hard to do. So we're moving towards more of this being returned to shareholders, and we mentioned that we'll be at least at the level we were last year this year. And I'd expect later in the year, we'll talk more about how on a longer-term basis we can be more aggressive returning that cash to shareholders. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's very helpful. And Chris, in describing the foreign exchange headwind for 2015, you used the term massive. I think you fellows were talking about $0.75 expectation at your Q1. Is that still in line with what your thoughts were? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: So for the back half of the year, assuming it kind of stays in the range that it is right now, the euro, that's probably around $0.35. I mean I think we said $0.30 to $0.40 in the material. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Yeah. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Terrific. Thanks so much. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Frank. Keith, let's move on to the next. Operator : Okay. And that comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Brian. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. I think last quarter you maybe indicated the second quarter earnings would be maybe $0.15 or so below where you came in at, but I see you raised the full year by about $0.10. Just wondering if there is anything that's changed to make you a little bit more conservative about the back half of the year. You mentioned some slowdown in China maybe recently, but how conservative is that? And do you feel like anything has really changed against you since the first quarter earnings call? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I think we're just tightening up the range a bit. So I think that's the way you should look at it, that we put a pretty broad range out there when we started this. And we're trying to signal a tightening of that and an upward movement and what we think the normalized number would be. That's what we're doing. So there's nothing. We're not looking at the back half of the year as foretelling of anything negative. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Just on the CapEx outlook, could you just provide an update for the year and maybe tied into that how the methanol plant is coming in versus your original budget? And maybe kind of an early look at 2016 as some of that spending on methanol dropped. Any kind of early feel for where CapEx might shake out next year? Thanks. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: I'll take the CapEx question and Mark can give you an update on the project. So we're $350 million to $400 million for this year, net of the contributions that our joint venture partner gives back to us. And just as a reminder, when you're looking at our cash flow statement, you have to do that math since we consolidate that venture, the Mitsui share shows up down in financing. So you need to remember to net that against the CapEx that you see. So that number is probably $350 million to $400 million. Going into 2016, as we get closer, we'll update you with specifics but it should go down. And I think generally, what you can expect here with that is increasing levels of free cash flow generated by the business and that's why we'll be talking to you more and more about shareholder returns as well. Mark, do you want to talk about the project? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, it's really been a fantastic project. If you look at the success we've had constructing this very large world-scale plant in a very short period of time has been just phenomenal. We have had major impacts from rain, pressing 90 days since the start of the project and I was asked that day how is that possible? Well, we had planned in, in our project, some rain delays and some efficiency gains. And so what we've seen is a project slide from what we really anticipate at one time will be a July kind of completion more to end of August kind of completion. So of those three months, it would probably cost us a month-and-a-half or so on what our perfect schedule would've been. Nonetheless, we expect to be operating by the 1st of October, and the plant's essentially complete now in terms of big items of equipment. We're in the commissioning stages, early commissioning stages of the plant as we speak. So I think it's gone pretty well. Regarding cost, I think we'll be 15% over on the project, something like that, could be a skosh higher or a skosh lower, but that kind of range, it really boils down almost exclusively to construction efficiency. Part of that was the rain. We had to just increase staffing to manage those days, and part of that was really in the pipefitting and welding trades, which were pretty difficult for us. Everything else was absolutely very, very efficient as you would expect. So I think it's going to come in essentially 15% or something like that. Brian P. Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Brian. Keith, let's go to the next. Operator : Thank you and that comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, P.J. How are you? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Hi, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Mark, you guys have announced several price increases in acetyls in the first half, but you talked about sort of weak operating rates in China. So are these price increases part of your new contract structure that you have in place now that you're getting rid of all these old index contracts? And then secondly on acetyls, you got a couple of moving parts on the raw materials side. You got ethylene costs that should come down with turnarounds coming to an end. And then you got this purchase to produce methanol thing. So can you talk about the raw material side as well? Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Give me one second. Let me get actual numbers here for you. But when you look at the raw material front, we had a negative impact of ethylene that could be measured maybe in $20 million or so this quarter that kind of headwind, P.J. And it's probably going to reverse itself next quarter. So those two things are going to kind of wash out \u2013 you just kind of wash out, if I'll say, over this two quarter or three quarter period. And the fundamental sense I think that \u2013 what we've really done with these contract arrangements, P.J., and help running the business is to really minimize, if you will, the victimization of these sort of out-of-cycle spikes and movements in price. We're not totally free of it, ergo, some of the problems we had here, but we're getting to be largely free of big impacts relative to those things. And P.J., the first question was what? I'm sorry. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah, just talking about the price increases that you announced so far, and the fact that things are still a little weak in China. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. They are. I mean I think they're \u2013 a lot of these markets are \u2013 if you look at the chain markets, they are much more regional. If you think of the acid market it's a more international case. So what you've seen is we're trying to be very open and transparent in what we're doing in the marketplace. And we're pushing pricing hard. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we've actually had great success overcoming what's been a big stack of unbelievable headwinds as we go into this year with currency and with methanol to name two of them. So I think they're just indicative of what we're doing and how aggressive we're being to drive value and see if we get a return on our invested capital in these businesses. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. I just had a second question for Chris on all the write-downs that you had. Can you just talk through the logic of $39 million ethanol plant write-down, which we know what it is, and then also $5 million in business optimization charge, and then $6 million on the Fairway Methanol? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Yeah. So the Fairway Methanol and TDU really kind of \u2013 the technology development unit are really kind of the same thing, so that was the decision to write off some assets in that ethanol activity that at this point, we really wouldn't need to further advance that technology, if we decide to do that. So as you know, we got the fully operational plant in Nanjing. It right now produces industrial ethanol. There's also a pilot plant, I believe, at our Clear Lake facility, separate from the technology development unit on a smaller scale. And we can advance the technology if we need to with those assets, so we thought that that meant it was the appropriate time to recognize that in our asset valuation. Oh, your other question was business optimization? P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: That's mostly the project costs associated with our European headquarter transition that is almost complete at this point. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, P.J. Keith, let's go to the next. Operator : Thank you and that comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Hey, Laurence. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Laurence. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : I guess two questions. Mark, can you give a sense for the structural improvement opportunities you have left over the next three years to five years and will the annual tailwind start to diminish? I mean is it going to get tougher to deliver the kind of cadence you've had the last couple of years? And secondly, as you look at the portfolio, do you feel that you have the right alignment given the choppiness that you're seeing in the end markets, particularly in AEM, or is there any repositioning or some bolt-ons that you need specifically for that business? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the first two are really kind of productivity questions, I guess, Laurence, and what we see is that we've kind of set in our minds that we need to be at a $100 million run rate in our businesses. We're clearly going to get that this year. I think we'll get that next year. So my gut is that if you look at it and relative to this year's basis of $100 million, we should be able to press, based on the things we've done this year, $200 million next year. And I kind of don't think that's over. In other words, I don't think that's one-and-done. I think as we look at it, as Chris looks at it and others, there are opportunities for us to continue to drive further and further efficiency in our business and in the business model. So my belief is that kind of run rate growth should be something that we can continue for a little while anyway. If you're looking at it from a portfolio point of view, there are chemistries we like to have, Laurence, in our business. And I kind of don't necessarily want to call them out specifically but we remain resolute in trying to find ways to bring them into our portfolio. They would involve acquisitions, primarily bolt-on acquisitions, and it's just been very hard for us to do. So that's an area that we have a similar team working, much like we do on our new product introductions. We want to get to a point we can be an M&A machine in bringing in small and bolt-on kind of properties to really enhance this model that we think is clearly differentiating us in the marketplace. But it's been a bit frustrating. We've not been able to \u2013 beyond CoolPoly, which is turning out great for us, we've not really been able to do as much of that as we want. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And then on a similar vein with the cellulosics, in the past, there's been some discussion of repositioning some of those assets into other areas such as biopolymers. How long do you think that business has before you sort of can say those experiments are working or not working? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the experiments are working. We're having success with those biopolymers. It's just the uptake. When you're trying to replace tow, if that's a mindset that you have, it's going to take a lot of additional work for us to get to that point. So we're pleased with some of the progress we're having, particularly in CelFX that we're having out there, but it's just getting started, is how I'd say that, Laurence. A ways to go. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay, thanks. Thanks. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Laurence. Keith, let's move to the next question. Operator : And that's from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Just wanted to revisit the AI side of things. Obviously, a bunch of moving parts like you rightly said earlier. On one side of things, obviously, supply/demand fundamentals quite slack, the Southern contract was still alive and well in Q2, which obviously has expired now. So I guess you'll be contract-less at least for Q3. I'm just trying to figure out, you saw 420 basis points of sequential EBITDA margin declines. It seems the bulk of those come on the back of these higher ethylene prices. You mentioned $20 million there. I'm just trying to get a sense of, in today's relatively slack acetyl supply/demand environment, what is the sustainable sort of EBITDA margin? Is it 15%? Is it 22% that you reported in Q1? Just trying to get a better sense of that. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We think it's 15%. But I'm not looking to this next quarter. But... Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : No. No. Surely. I'm just talking about, let's say, utilization rates remain within the low 80%s. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So pop over to next year, I would be surprised if it's not 15%. I mean from a sustainable point of view, that's kind of the position that we've taken and we think that is on average sustainable for a long period of time and we should have the ability on average to ratchet that up and we can do extraordinary things in the marketplace and take advantage of certain situations. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : And it seems the way you've structured the contracts, you're trying to minimize the volatility there as well; that even on the upside, you won't see huge spikes; neither will you on the downside. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, no, I'm okay for spikes to go up. I'm not trying to say those things, don't let that rumor get out. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Fair enough. Fair enough. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : All we're trying to do is position ourselves to make sure \u2013 we're not trying to \u2013 we're trying to make sure we have the degrees of freedom to drive value and not subsidize customers over a long period of time should the market move against us. And the position we were in in a prior life in many ways is we were increasing volatility by pushing customers to buy volume they didn't need and just drive lower, lower, lower pricing or the other way around, we're running ourselves to a situation where the market was totally laid out and you have this tremendous flare-up in prices. So we are trying to mute, I think, the industry volatility. But on a day-to-day basis, we're trying to maximize netback to Celanese in the return. Chris, do you want to make a comment? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: I just wanted to clarify. I think your first question, you said EBITDA margin? Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : EBITDA, yes. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Yeah. I think we're talking about EBITDA margin. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're talking about EBITDA margin. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Yeah, that's right. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. So... Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: So EBITDA will be a couple of percentages higher than that. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Okay. So call it 17%, 18% EBITDA? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Yeah. It's about right. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Fair enough. And as a follow-up, obviously Clear Lake seems to be on track despite sort of headwinds from the rains and the like, but any further decisions regarding a second methanol plant? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We're continuing to work with our partner and we've reached out to some other potential interested parties, and two of them reaching out to us. So there's sort of a new consortium that's been formed to try to fund the ideal way to bring this on, the ideal location. I wouldn't expect a decision on methanol this year, the second project. We do have a permit \u2013 I will say that we do have permits in hand for Bishop, but we are certainly willing to and we are exploring some other options that could afford better economics for us now. So we're continuing to look at and be mindful that our interest to be about a third of a new commercial unit. And that'd be kind of our max interest, which will balance us very well in the U.S. That means we need another partner for two-thirds or we need another two partners. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Fair enough. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So we're working out and taking our time, but we think that probably a year from now we'll be in a position to say we're going to do it or not. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Super. Thank you so much, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Appreciate it, Hassan. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, Hassan. Keith, let's move to the next two questions and have this be the last set. Operator : Okay. Very good. The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, John. Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: Good morning. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : I'm looking at slide four down at the bottom where it talks about the shared and integrated activities of the company. On the outside, all we can see is the intra-segment sales. Is there any metrics you can help us with in terms of understanding how much sharing, how much integration there is? Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, John. This is Jon. I'll start on that. We're in a very tight chain when you think about where we participate. And when you go from essentially having 95% of our products that are coming off of methanol and ethylene, we sit on a very tight chain and we get a good benefit from that from a raw material standpoint and the efficiencies that we get on raw material that goes into supply chain. We also have large integrated facility that also gives us a cost advantage in certain areas of the business. And there's also shared technology and technology and innovation development that we use across the tight chain that we participate in. So that's what that's intended to capture is the cross-company benefit that we get in being a very tight chain where we take methanol and ethylene and produce acetic acid, downstream products, and VAM and then high-engineered plastics and other consumer products. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And you got a question earlier on currency. Is it still $0.03 to $0.04 to earnings for every \u20ac0.01 change in the euro exchange rate? Is there anything you're pursuing that might lower that leverage to it, the currency? Chris Jensen - Senior Vice President, Finance: That's about right. And aside from financial hedges which you can do, they always have a finite life. The only thing that we could really do to sort of permanently take that away would be to price all of our European contracts in dollars. And that's just probably not achievable. I mean you've got a flow with the way business gets done there. There's some of that that we can and have done. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, John. And thanks everybody on the line today. I'll be around for questions. Thanks for your interest in Celanese. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Celanese Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Puckett. Please go ahead. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Carrie. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2015 conference call. My name is Jon Puckett, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Jensen, SVP-Finance and Chief Financial Officer. The Celanese Corporation's third quarter 2015 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included in our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been being submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. We also submitted a Form 8-K/A this morning to correct a clerical error on page five of our non-GAAP reconciliation. This morning, we will begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we'll field your questions. I'd like to now turn the call over to Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments brief and open the line for your questions. From my perspective, this quarter really demonstrates our ability to execute our strategic plans, drive what we can control, and create value regardless of the external environment. We achieved a huge milestone for our corporation, the completion and start-up of the methanol unit in Clear Lake, Texas. We started construction on this plant 21 months ago with an aggressive timeline, and our talented team completed it in record time at an impressive capital cost of less than $700 per ton. At 1.3 million tons of capacity, it is the largest, most efficient, and we believe the most economical methanol plant in the U.S., truly an impressive accomplishment. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.50. That's the second-highest third quarter earnings performance in our history, reflecting the success we're having with our commercial models, overcoming global challenges, while also delivering on broad-based productivity initiatives across our business and functions. We generated segment income of $305 million in the quarter, and set a third quarter margin record of 21.6%. We continue to generate strong levels of cash, and we're tracking towards delivering record free cash flow for the year. Our confidence in our ability to generate cash prompted us to return a record amount of cash to our shareholders in the quarter by repurchasing $420 million of stock; and dividends for the quarter boosted the total cash return to $467 million. We also announced $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we intend to execute over the next two years. As we look through the remainder of 2015, we are confident in our ability to drive value across both cores, continued success of our productivity initiatives, and growing success in new product introductions. So we increased our outlook for earnings to a range of $5.90 to $6.10 per share for 2015. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jon for Q&A. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Mark. I'd like everybody on the phone to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. Carrie, let's go ahead and get started with the Q&A. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. Two quick ones. First, in your comments about the $50 million of productivity for next year, is there a tax line or is that just all cost adjustments? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Laurence. This is Mark. No, that's as we scope productivity, that would be a net impact. The productivity doesn't include tax in that assessment that we've done. And I want to comment, that is just the start as we keep this as an evergreen process, but this time of year we start consolidating those numbers. And our first pass consolidation was $50 million, and there's more to come. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : And then, secondly, as a comment about pushing 10% for \u2013 bridge for pushing 10% growth in 2016, how much of that depends on \u2013 what's your framework around normalized levels of demand? Or can you give us some sense of just where you see the demand levels going into next year at this point? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, at the broad \u2013 so, let me back up a little bit on that, Laurence. I think what we're doing is we're kind of scoping with my comments of range. We really want to share a lot of detail with you guys coming up in a few weeks in New York for that plan. But let me simply say that, on a demand perspective, we do think \u2013 I mean, China has been very, very weak today, and I'm sure, I'll have a chance to comment more on this as we go through the call. We have a view that China is really as bad as it's going to be. And we already see signs that China seems to be recovering a bit, and we're optimistic that we'll see some uptick year-over-year in demand in China. In the Materials section, broadly speaking, we are very confident in our ability to continue to grow that business through our new product introductions and efforts there. I commented on tow, that we see tow as being pretty flat from a demand point of view year-over-year. From an earnings point of view, demand could actually be down a bit, if there's more inventory correction. So I would say, broadly speaking, we see a recovering economy in China, we see a stronger economy in the U.S., and probably the same in Europe. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Laurence. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Laurence. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, John. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So to your comment a second ago that you \u2013 looking to 2016, you kind of think tow will be flat, that would kind of imply that you continue to see some relatively serious destocking. So maybe you can give us an update as to what you're seeing right now and maybe what's a little bit different from what you were expecting earlier this year. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we've always been pretty guarded about how long it would take to work off the destocking there. And I guess what I would say to you, and I always caution everyone, we don't have clarity into the markets, particularly in China. And we're there every day; we have teams of people there working. It's just a very complicated market. But what we've seen is that \u2013 from the data we've seen is that it would indicate that the \u2013 again, broadly speaking, that their objectives in reducing inventory in China were not yet fully satisfied. So that would tell me \u2013 well, they haven't told me this, but that would tell me that it's going to be probably more of the same as we go through next year. Now, outside of China, we think it's largely run its course. But inside China, we think there's still some effort going on there. John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And then, with regard to autos, I mean, it looks like there is at least some positive trends that were starting to pick up coming out of China, but maybe it's a little bit early. So when you're thinking about 2016, if we have a flat auto environment, how should we be thinking about the demand pull that you'll see, just based on new applications, say, in the auto industry? I know you highlighted a bunch of opportunities in some of the prepared remarks last night. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, the early looks at 2016 for a broad base, 2.5% sort of increase in volume year-over-year. And the good news always for us is that's in North America, and it's in Germany, and it's now emerging more in Greater China, which is projected to be up 3% or 4% next year versus a pretty stagnant year this year. When we look at our ability to move in that market, we have multiples of that ratio. So two times or three times that ratio is what we think. So we believe that in auto, we should be able to get 6% to 9% growth off of a 2% to 3% global growth, if that helps. And that's \u2013 I listed one example in the call and will go into, but for a skid plate on a vehicle, we're seeing more and more applications picking up our capability to do composites as well. We've got a lot of work going on in new models, particularly in Europe, that are quite exciting. So, we're pretty confident we can go to multiples of the national growth rate. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks a lot. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank, John. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Mark, on the same point, very strong numbers in AEM, but volumes were down actually 3% in the quarter. So what's happening there versus the supposed \u2013 likely two times or three times growth in the market? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We did have a little weakness in some markets. I think some of the emerging markets were particularly slow for us. And I'll mention India, where we've seen a little bit of a wholesale movement of second tier products in the Indian market, and that particularly hit us hard in that regard. We also spent time, if I can say this, moving our production assets around to make higher value products, and that's one of the ways we drove margins. So some of that volume we passed on, if I can say that, David, to move in, in the smaller volumes, but nonetheless higher return products. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Understood. And then, on the same bent, volume growth was minus 6% in Acetyl Intermediates. Why was \u2013 was that driven by China or China and others? Any clarity there? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think, you can really say, it was China, we saw China \u2013 we do really think hit the bottom in the third quarter. As we ended the quarter, it was starting to get better, but really just tremendous overcapacity, almost unimaginable levels of overcapacity in China now. Assets are being shut down and people are just \u2013 there's not a lot of inherent demand at this moment in time; and so almost all of that fall-off was in China. Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : David, I'd just add to that, back on your Materials question, that it's typical in the third quarter that you get some European customer plant shutdown activity, so it's not unusual to have that happen in the third quarter. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But that would nil last year, as well Chris, correct? Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Sorry, I thought you were asking the question sequentially. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, no. Year-over-year. Thank you. Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, David. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, David. Carrie, let's move on to the next. Operator : Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks and good morning, everyone. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Vincent. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just on the buybacks in the quarter, it looks like you used the revolver for a fair amount of it. And then for the $1 billion of buybacks you're going to do over the next two years, how should we think about \u2013 obviously you have some U.S. cash flows from operations, but a lot of it is offshore, and a lot of your existing cash is offshore. So how should we be thinking about the way that you're going to fund those repurchases? Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : So, as we go through the next couple of years, we expect that our free cash flow will be better than it is today, and so most of it will be funded from that. As you pointed out, we really haven't touched the balance sheet cash. So we'll have $900 million to $1 billion of cash here at the end of the year. We'll expect to use some of that cash next year to pay off that amount that we borrowed under the revolver. So you can think prospectively over a two-year period of almost all of these being funded from \u2013 from free cash flow. We may spend down our global cash balances a little bit as well. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And in the process of doing that, should we be expecting to see a higher tax rate as a result? Or how will that work? Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No. I think we'll talk more about 2016, but at this point, I'd say we'll still be less than 20% on the tax rate, the adjusted tax rate. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Vincent. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Vincent. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Carrie, let's go on to the next. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on weathering the methanol contract expiration fairly well. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Frank. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : As I look at the year-over-year trends, you were down 4% year-over-year in Q2 on volumes, down 7% on price. A little bit of an acceleration there down 5% on volumes in Q3 year-over-year and down 10% on price. So little bit worse than the Q2 year-over-year comps, yet you posted a very nice upside surprise. I guess the simple question is, as we think back to what we thought three months ago to what we actually posted today, what went right for you guys? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, there's a lot of effort went into making this transition, bridging this transition. So we \u2013 to the extent we could, we \u2013 let's say that we had methanol available, some methanol available carried over a little bit in the first month. We also had accumulated some acetic acid that we've built up, all of which to help us moderate, if I can say that, Frank, the hole for methanol. And so, the pain wasn't quite as intense as we thought it would be, as we went through that quarter. So that's one thing that went well for us, I think. The startup went very well. We had \u2013 in our own mind, we had some concerns about that, as of course as you're finishing the plan. And so, that enabled us to have confidence we were going to be able to run very hard, very quickly with that unit. And that helped us in the planning, the scheduling as well. I go on to say, our models are really working well for us, Frank. I mean, the team is out there every day looking for ways to use these global models, particularly in Pat's business. And really, we're just \u2013 I don't know how to say this \u2013 we're just totally attuned to the market. So, we are \u2013 we're looking at every opportunity of making conscious decisions every day, and that allows us to extract incremental money that others can't. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. So the latter part is something obviously that's going to be ongoing. And just coming back to the use of cash, obviously you guided to about $225 million of share buyback in the second half, you did $420 million just in Q3 alone. With this $1 billion over two years, seems like a very modest pace relative to what you just executed. Are you being conservative in that regard? And in terms of use of cash, does M&A play a role? Are you preparing for Bishop? Can you expand a little bit more on the cash? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think \u2013 I don't know that we're conservative, but we try to be very thoughtful. And we have a lot of M&A activities underway that tend to be smaller in scope. It's important for us to add, without steering too much to add several hundred million dollars of EBIT. These are the M&A that logically plugs into our business over, let's say, the next three years. And so, we're anticipating our funding needs relative to that. We're anticipating our cash generation needs. The ongoing efforts to drive greater and greater value, and put all these together and we think $1 billion is reasonable. It shouldn't stress us. And so could we do a bit more? Yeah, maybe, but we want to let some things unfold before we make a commitment to do so. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Looking forward to Friday the 13th. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Frank. Carrie, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Mark, I understand your pride in the capital cost of your methanol plant. Can you give us some help on what it might cost to make methanol in a brand-new plant at $2.50 gas and how that compares to the $0.90 market price right now for methanol? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I love you, Bob. That's a lot of data, man. It's not as good as our contract with Southern, but it's getting pretty close. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And is there any hope that Southern will need to place that volume somewhere and you could help them out since you're still a little net short of methanol? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think Southern is placed \u2013 the market is still materially higher than our cost, thank goodness. But now that Southern is out placing that material in the market today, and I don't think they need our help. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And just... Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We're friends with them. If they want to sell something \u2013 we have a very good relationship, and so, I'm sure we'll talk to them about buying some material from them. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And I want to make sure I heard you right, because I thought you said China was getting a little better. Is that what you said? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Yeah. That's my prediction. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And does that provide you any incentive to try and do M&A a little quicker? Because it would seem like the world feels a lot worse, then maybe you should move before it feels better. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It absolutely does. Yes. Yeah, that's exactly right. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Hi. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, P.J. How are you? P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good. Mark, you talked about China hitting bottom in third quarter, and then maybe recovery in China going forward. Is that a common company-specific Celanese based on your end markets? Are you making a generic comment that you think based on your observations in China? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, P.J., we're kind of old-fashioned here. So we just get out a lot and spend time with customers, and it's hard to describe the \u2013 there's a lot of negative feeling amongst the SOEs and the manufacturing industry in general in China today, on one hand. On the other hand, if you look at it from a retail point of view, if you spend time out and about, there's a lot of really positive things happening in the country. So, there's a \u2013 I think what I've just said, practically there's a limit to how much things can slow down. I think they kind of reached that limit. And so, we're seeing signs that things are getting a bit better. So my kind of belief is, is whether this is immediately going to signal a ramp up in China I wouldn't say that, but I think as we look back over this historically, the third quarter is going to be the low point, and you're going to see China start to come out of the situation that they're in. That's what \u2013 I think that's what we feel, and that's certainly what our customers feel. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then in the past, you've bought a lot of stock here recently, but you haven't done any significant M&A, if I look at the last three years, four years. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's right. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Now, you're talking about M&A. Is that somewhat change in strategy on how you're thinking? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think, P.J., I always quote my old friend Dennis Riley . He used to love to tell you guys, not only what he was going to do, what he wasn't going to do. What we're not going to do is just something stupid as it comes to M&A. And so we have looked at a lot of deals, lot of big deals, and we simply \u2013 and that's where we are focused. We couldn't make it work. So we've totally converted our effort now to go after much smaller deals, use CoolPoly as the example, and we'll show you guys in November, some real examples of how that \u2013 the very small acquisition has given us some real positive traction in lot of areas. We're looking at much smaller deals. We have a number of non-binding offers out today on these small deals, and it takes a number to get one. And so, yeah, you should see us be a lot more active there. We've been active; we've been looking in area, I think that was a tough area to complete one in. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, P.J. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, P.J. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. When I look at the adhesives companies, they seem to be growing pretty slowly or contracting. And the coatings companies have also had issues with demand. So has that affected vinyl acetate monomer demand? What's the shape of VAM demand these days, and sort of what's pricing like? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jeff. So the answer to your question is yes. In most of the markets, I think, that we're in, if you only get from a pure market point of view has fairly little growth. And so, the way we have to grow is do new and novel things, if I can say that. In the coating areas, some of the activities around VAE and those kind of coatings are still very positive, and we're still seeing, not double digit, we're still seeing strong growth though in those areas. That's kind of one bright spot. If I look at VAM, from a VAM point of view; VAM is just pretty long now, although there are some signs, it's getting a bit tighter. We've seen pricing wane a bit in that as you come off that \u2013 the chronic shortages of last year. We're out actually pushing some pricing now, and seem to be getting little bit of traction on that. But I think you should look at this as being a pretty anemic marketplace right now, and the marketplace is looking for a bottom to start recovering from. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, for your methanol plant which is running at full rates, does full rates mean, I don't know, 95% capacity utilization? And do you expect that to be the norm from now till the end of the year, if that's what you mean? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's running at 100% capacity, which you'd expect. Methanol plants are a little bit, I mean, they're pretty \u2013 chemically they're pretty simple operation. So you tend to run them at a \u2013 they don't hunt, if I can say that, Jeff. So you'll kind of lock it at 100% and let it run. And we'll take it down a few weeks a year. It's kind of the way you should look at that. And so, we pop the unit up and down a few times since we first put feet in it, just getting things worked out. But generally speaking, we're running it at 100% rates, and I would expect just to continue to run at that level from now on. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks a lot. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jeff. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Hi. Good morning, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Just wanted to revisit the \u2013 sort of pricing side of things within AI. Obviously, there were a couple of pricing hike announcements through the course of Q3, yet sequentially, Q2 to Q3, pricing was down around 3%, right? So what I'm trying to get sort of a handle on is that, obviously spot pricing, be it on the acetic side or the VAM side, came down through the course of the quarter as did methanol pricing as well. So \u2013 and you obviously talked about supply/demand fundamentals being quite slack as well. So the question really is, how in such an environment does one sort of achieve any pricing hikes? That's question number one. And associated with that, question number two is, that if you do achieve those price hikes, some of the price hikes that tried to implement in Q3, is there a lag effect? Will we see those hike sort of coming through in Q4? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Hassan, it's a really complicated market, so you need to think of almost truly a spot market. And so you're always out there looking for the ability to sell cargos, and enter in a deal, that's a little bit favorable from a margin point of view from where you were the prior day. So price hikes are signals to the marketplace where we're going out and trying to get. And more important than the price hike is the margin that you're trying to drive. So it's a function of not only the price, but also the raw material input at the time. So we've been out trying to create momentum around driving higher margins in this business. It's been very hard, as you've said, and I'd be misrepresented, I'd say, we've seen a big margin increase. In fact, margins have been flat to pretty steady the last couple of quarters or certainly the last quarter. So I don't know quite how to answer your question other than to say that, the market needs to get a bit tighter before you can really start driving margins, Hassan. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Sure thing. Sure. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And that's \u2013 and it's \u2013 there are several outages out now, scheduled outages in China where plants are going down for several months to just do repairs, but also to sit down for a bit, because the market is long. We're getting ready to go down a bit for some turnaround activity in \u2013 particularly in China. So I think those are, again, signaling sort of the bottom of this trough piece, and you're going to start to see margins go up. And you'll see us announce pricing as part of that activity. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Fair enough. And maybe this is something that you'd want to address on the Analyst Day, but one of the things that you talked about in your qualitative guidance was that, obviously, some headwinds, currency being one of them, offsetting those headwinds via productivity, and one of the things that you talked about capacity rationalization as well. So just wanted to get a sense of, as we look into 2016, if you could sort of talk broadly about what areas that rationalization you may do in, and associated with that, how much of a cash drain could that potentially be in 2016? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So we will \u2013 if you'll let me punt that a bit for a few weeks, we'll take a better shot at that in November. What I will say is that we are \u2013 we have several activities under way. We're talking to employees now about outages. And from the scope of things, they're not \u2013 on one hand, they're not huge. On the other hand, it does let us consolidate, get efficiency and drive value. So you should think of that in terms of $20 million, $30 million kind of thing, not a $100 million kind of opportunity. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Thanks so much, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Hassan. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jim. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: You're doing a really good job in AEM of holding price when raw materials were falling. Just wondering if you could give us your perception of how customers view that relationship; you've clearly got some pricing power here. And do you see that as pretty sustainable going forward? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, customers don't like it, Jim. I mean, so you've got to make sure that you're bringing them a lot of value in that process. I think the answer to your question, yeah, I think so. We're working really hard to go in and very rapidly solve problems. The undercarriage example I gave you, I mean the amount of \u2013 what we can do well is we can talk to a customer in Japan and triangulate with all of their tier suppliers around the world, introducing a new product or a line to go into a bunch of different vehicles, and we do that better than anybody else. And that allows us to have an edge on the pricing that you talked about. In return for that, we get to sell quality products and the quality applications at a higher price than others. So I think you should expect us to continue to do that. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And just on your 2015 earnings outlook, I mean, it looks like the magnitude of the beat that you had in the third quarter is roughly the same as the increase in your guidance. Yet with China possibly seeing an uptick, I'm just wondering are you being a little bit cautious on how you view the fourth quarter, and why wouldn't you be more optimistic given your views on China? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Jim, it's just early, it's early in the process. And I'll also say that we see other signs out there of people wanting to \u2013 we've got recently some announcements from folks that tell us they've got stuff scheduled for December they were going to go and shove to January. So people are going to be taking steps to clean up this year, if I can say that, and it is hard for us to factor those things in, but those things can easily be a $20 million hit or something if you get a number of companies and a number of businesses that want to reduce inventory and things like that. So we expect this to be a tough quarter, even though we're starting to talk about China being a bit better. Jim M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks a lot, Jim. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Jim. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. How far out into the future is the methanol JV buying gas? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hell, John, I've forgotten. Not that long. I mean, we have part of the gas locked up for most of next year, but not all of it. So, yeah, I'd be happy to share more detail, I just don't have it with me right now. What we tend to do is we tend to \u2013 we don't tend to go 100% on anything. So we will \u2013 we lock into some pretty good positions for a portion of our gas and we'll continue to kind of treat it that way. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And if you collapsed the two business units within the Acetyl Chain, collapsed Acetyl Intermediates and Industrial Specialties from a reporting, is there a layer of cost that could be taken out with, is that something that's worth looking at? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, if you look at it from a \u2013 part of the productivity we're getting is we're really running these cores with a lot of shared resources now in there, and we're making sure that in support of those cores we're aligned from a functional point of view in a more efficient fashion. So everybody in this company wears at least two baseball hats, some wear three or four. So we're \u2013 the answer to your question is yes, we can do more there, we'll continue to do more there, and some of the productivity we talked about is a reflection of that. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : But you'll probably continue to report the two business units? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean it's \u2013 you mean the subordinated units within the Acetyl Chain? John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Yeah. I just don't know if there's another layer to take out there if you brought them together... Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. No, at some point, we'll fully collapse them. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We promise, we report it for a while, and we're talking about how we should move forward in the future. John E. Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, John. And Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Let's have this to be the last series of questions. Operator : All right. The next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I... Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : ...just had a question on your SG&A line. You've done a tremendous job of lowering that year-on-year, but \u2013 and certainly you're focused on more productivity. But curious to know how much of that has been the benefits of currency, and so, going forward, how much of the costs that you've taken out there is sustainable? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Some of it is currency from our European operations. But Chris, do you have a sense to that? Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. I'm trying to \u2013 what periods are you looking at? Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Just year-to-date. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Year-to-date. Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. We get \u2013 if it's year-to-date versus year-to-date last year, there's some amount of currency benefit, but it's not massive. I mean, think of that being $10 million to $20 million for the year. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Got it. Christopher W. Jensen - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Just looking at SG&A. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Yeah, it's not the issue. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : And then, obviously, the methanol plant coming off, you've finished your \u2013 the buildup there, and so you've freed up cash, and you certainly talked about returning that to shareholders. But I'm curious as to how much of that might be siphoned off towards innovation. And certainly that's going to be something you're talking about at Investor Day, but how are you thinking about things like your vitality index and new product introductions as a percent of total sales? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we've \u2013 we're putting a lot of energy in that, we think we're fully funding that today. What I will say is that, we are starting to adopt some \u2013 from a vitality point of view, some longer-term investments in areas that seemingly make sense to us, that could, at some point, require us to up that spending from the level we're at currently. At the Investor Show, we'll share a lot detail about our new product launches, and how we do the math around those, and how we expect to continue to grow that, and how that correlates to sales revenue that we expect from new products that we introduce. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. Looking forward to it. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Nils. Jon Puckett - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Thanks, Nils. Carrie, I'll turn it back over to you. We appreciate everybody's time this morning, and we'll be around for questions later today. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Kyrish. Please go ahead. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Carrie. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2015 conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Celanese Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation\u2019s future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we\u2019ll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we\u2019ll field your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I\u2019ll keep my comments brief and then open the line for your questions. Today I\u2019m pleased to report adjusted earnings of $6.02 per share for 2015 with EBIT margins of 21.8%. That\u2019s a 320 basis point improvement year-over-year. We also generated record levels of free cash flow and returned $594 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, a great financial year for Celanese. 2015 was also a year of tremendous organizational change at Celanese. As we accomplished several foundation objectives, which will contribute meaningfully towards achieving our 2018 financial targets. We aligned the company behind two complementary cores, driving clarity and focus through the corporation, while realizing significant synergies and leveraging the skills of our teams. We built the largest, most efficient, and lowest cost per ton U.S. Methanol plant in record time to replace an existing, I\u2019m sorry, replace an expiring supply contract. We improved our manufacturing footprint and took steps to ensure commercial flexibility and our ability to take advantage of market opportunities. We implemented a robust pipeline process and launched over 1,000 new projects and through all of this, we delivered around $100 million of broad-based productivity gains across the company. Looking ahead to 2016, we\u2019re confident of our business models, structure, and the teams we have in place to manage to the challenging macro environment the world find itself in today, one of declining energy and raw material prices, demand uncertainty, and currency volatility. We expect our commercial strategies and new product introductions, our pipeline successes along with our focus on delivering $100 million in productivity will also allow us to grow earnings this year by 5% to 10% keeping us well on track to meet our 2018 financial objectives. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Chuck for Q&A. Chuck Kyrish : Right, thanks, Mark. So we\u2019d like everybody on the phone to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Let\u2019s go ahead and get started. Operator : All right. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo : Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo for Laurence. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Dan Rizzo : In terms of Acetyl, I know things haven\u2019t quite bottomed out there yet. I mean, what kind of visibility do you have going into 2016? Is this something where we\u2019re going to have to just bring, I mean, step down our assumptions every two or three years or is it something that we think is finally kind of bottoming out here? Mark Rohr : Well, I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on there. The uncertainty in the market is largely based on the uncertainty around the amount of tow China is going to import. Tow volumes imported several years ago where well north of 100,000 tons, maybe 120,000 tons or so. Last year, we think they went to 50,000 to 60,000 tons. It is uncertain what they\u2019re going to this year, but I would not be surprised for them to reduce it again this year to some level. So that creates uncertainty back in the market. We\u2019re taking steps to offset the ripple effect of that. So we\u2019re looking at being flat year-over-year in tow. But I will say that that, the sooner that China can get to its end game the better, I think for that market to stabilize and for things to reverse their course. Dan Rizzo : And then you mean, I think, you launched the 1,000 new products last year I mean, what\u2019s \u2013 going forward, I mean, what\u2019s the current \u2013 is there \u2013 I mean, the pipeline still as full, is it coming in a bit, or is it expanding? Mark Rohr : Yes, as we look at it right now, we probably, we would forecast to be at 1,200 this year kind of level. We have \u2013 we\u2019ve internally we need to keep growing that and we have programs in a way to grow that some of the launches you\u2019ve seen of our new products in the marketplace like stepping out in a nylon. We have some great technology there that we never leverage. So we\u2019re doing more of that kind of activity and that\u2019s certainly going to help us to expand our market and market space and I think they\u2019ll help us launch more and more new projects. Dan Rizzo : Okay. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great, thanks. Carrie, let\u2019s move onto our next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Duffy Fisher of Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fisher : Yes, good morning, folks. Mark Rohr : Hi, Duffy. Duffy Fisher : Question just around the profitability spread kind of between the upstream and the downstream. The upstream suffered a little bit in the most reported quarter, but the downstream held onto it. I think, there\u2019s some concern that that\u2019s just a lead lag effect and then maybe some of that bleeds away, as we go through this year. But can you just kind of talk about your ability to hang onto that pricing in the downstream products, kind of throughout the rest of this year? Mark Rohr : Well, Duffy, I think, if you look at what\u2019s happened and I\u2019ll take currency as an example. We certainly were able to hold onto two-thirds of that margin this thing sort of compressed and we had a big currency impact. That\u2019s I think pretty dramatically reduced this year, as we go forward as we anticipate quite as much currency volatility impact it. So I would say that directionally we feel okay about keeping that kind of ratio. But for us to keep that ratio, we need to have some stability. In other words, if things keep dropping at some point, Duffy, it could get hard to hold onto it, I think, just because of the uncertainty. Now, but we \u2013 let me see things now as we think the \u2013 a lot of the deflation has run its course, not all of it perhaps, but a lot of it has. And so we\u2019re predicting that things will stabilize as we go through the first-half of the year and they start getting better towards the second-half. Duffy Fisher : Great. And then on the contract buyout, should we think about you guys making about your cost of capital on that, so if you invested a $175 million, that\u2019s going to be $15 to $20 million benefit from buying out that contract? Is that the right way to think about it? Mark Rohr : That\u2019s really a good way of looking at it. Duffy Fisher : Okay, great. Mark Rohr : Pretty accurate with the economics. Duffy Fisher : Okay. And then how does that leave Singapore as far as competitiveness and, say, versus producing and managing? Chuck Kyrish : Well, today, today\u2019s oil price is very competitive. It\u2019s roughly the same advantage that you have in U.S., so much more so than coal-based material. So we expect with the new supply agreement in place, we would be able to take advantage to that and drive greater market opportunities with that business. Duffy Fisher : Terrific. Thanks, Kyrish. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Dan. Mark Rohr : Okay, thanks, Dan. Carrie, let\u2019s move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thanks. Just a question on the free cash flow comments. I mean, I assume, I get that modest increase is excepted of the $733 million, not of the $556 million. But just curious, are you anticipating the definition of modest to me sounds like your are saying it\u2019s going to grow less than your \u2013 your earnings are going to grow, I\u2019m just curious why that would be, because I think of next year or this year service being more lower raw materials flowing through inventory and so forth, so you kind of think, you\u2019d have a working capital benefit, but maybe I\u2019m missing something? Chris Jensen : Yes, a couple of things. So first, yes, I realized that my comments didn\u2019t clarify very well that when, I said modest increase that\u2019s about the $733 million, right, so that\u2019s right. When we talk about 5% to 10% earnings growth, we\u2019re talking about earnings per share, and as you know, we plan to do some share repurchases. So not all of that translates to cash flow growth. So you will get cash flow growth from underling earnings increases. What I would tell you on working capital is, we had really strong working capital performance in the fourth quarter. And that is why that $733 million number sounds a bit better than what we talked about at our Investor Day, I remember exactly what I said, but it\u2019s somewhere in the 600s, I think we said. So working capital have really strong fourth quarter performance. I think that probably goes back the other way a little bit in 2016, because I\u2019m not sure we can sustain that same level of working capital. The other thing that I would mention to you is that, our capital spend net of the mid Mitsui reimbursement came in the low 300s in 2015, and that\u2019s a little bit lower than what I guided to you at Investor Day. The reason for that is that some of our late in the year capital spend did not actually get paid in cash in December it\u2019s tricking into 2016. So I\u2019ll be paying for some number of $30 million or $40 million of 2015 capital in 2016. Not now, again, I would reemphasize that we expect our sort of normal range to be more of the $250 million to $300 million of capital spend going forward. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, what is your expected tax rate for 2016? And just on the couple of comments and the comments from last night about you had some \u2013 there was a change in the rate, because there were some tax \u2013 there were some losses in jurisdictions without tax benefits. What were those and just how should we think about the tax rate in 2016 in general? Chris Jensen : Are you asking about the GAAP tax rate or the tax rate we use for adjusted EPS? Vincent Andrews : Well, I\u2019m asking for your \u2013 for 2016, I wanted to know what we should be using for adjusted EPS? And then, yes, on the GAAP rate for 2015, you said the increase was primarily attributable to losses in jurisdictions without tax benefit? Chris Jensen : Okay, I got it, got it. So for modeling for our adjusted earnings per share, we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019re going to be able to hold flat at 18% in 2016. I\u2019ll say what we all would say, which is, as your jurisdictional mix of earnings unfolds during the year that can always change, but that\u2019s our starting point. As far as our comments on the GAAP tax rate, which went from 33% in 2014 to 41% in 2015, yes, we said most of that is attributable to losses in jurisdictions without an earning benefit. And what that really means is, if you require or if you have big differed tax assets, which are net operating loss carryingforwards to post a valuation allowance against those depending on what jurisdiction they\u2019re in. So you see, we had these very large charges for the contract termination in Singapore and the impairments in China. So you have to tax effect those and there is jurisdictions and you end up posting valuation allowances against those, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big number this year. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Chuck Kyrish : All right. Thanks, Vincent. Carrie, let\u2019s move onto the the next one. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, in AI, how should we think about the methanol impact in 2016 versus 2015? Mark Rohr : You mean, in terms of straight financial impact? David Begleiter : Exactly given the\u2026 Mark Rohr : Just the production of methanol versus the old contract? David Begleiter : Exactly. Mark Rohr : Yes, yes. I think $10 million a quarter is the kind of \u2013 and I\u2019m going back to pre and post contract, is that make sense. So when we had the contract in place versus today, it\u2019s probably worse per quarter, so $40 million per year. David Begleiter : Fair enough. And just looking at consumer given your forecast for flat tow year-over-year. Can segment income and consumer be flat as well year-over-year, or it could be up year-over-year given lower raw materials? Mark Rohr : No, I think that there is a lot of puts and takes in that \u2013 in the material section there that that\u2019s pushing us towards a pretty flat year in that group. So let me give you one example of that \u2013 Ibn Sina joint venture is in there and that venture is getting hammered with lower oil price, which really impacts MTBE price. And so the return on that is getting pushed and we have two turnarounds in that venture this year as well, so it\u2019s down $30 million. So we have a few big things like that that are pushing it. So net-net, I think we\u2019re looking at for the material segment a pretty flat year. So up in engineered materials a little bit down in consumer and that\u2019s pretty flat. David Begleiter : Got it. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, David. Carrie, let\u2019s go onto the next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Nice start up on the methanol plant, seems like that\u2019s running smoothly so kudos. I\u2019m trying to understand a little bit more about the Singapore CO contract and why one vendor would be so far out of whack on the pricing side? Is there any \u2013 can you help me understand what exactly happened over there? I understand that you\u2019re now going to earn your return on \u2013 your cost of capital plus on how you figured it all out. But I\u2019m trying to have \u2013 to see how we got into the situation? Mark Rohr : Well, I don\u2019t want to dwell too much details about the contract, but it was a disadvantage contract. We terminated that contract and we renegotiated a new contract, and we basically paid a termination fee to get out of that contract. So it\u2019s not unusual for these contracts to have different bases based on the time that they were put together. And when this contract was put together, it made perfect sense and just evolved to a situation where it was not beneficial. Frank Mitsch : Okay. And I guess I can understand that. You talked about stepping into nylon, obviously this was one of the focal areas in terms of M&A at the recent Investor Day. Where do you stand on doing something on an inorganic basis in that area? Should we be surprised to see something on that front or not? Mark Rohr : Well, we think that our model, Frank, is really pretty unique what we are doing and we are getting lots of accolades from our customers. One of the things our customers have told us, as we need more products in that portfolio, because when they got to solve a problem, they will quite often look to classical solutions of it. So if you look at if it\u2019s a historically a nylon problem, we may not be made aware of that opportunity. So we think it\u2019s critical for us to add more products to our portfolio, things like PEEK, things like nylon, and we will back integrate in those as it make sense is the way I would say that. So you shouldn\u2019t be too surprised if we find a way to do that if announce we\u2019re doing it at some point. Frank Mitsch : Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Frank. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Frank. Carrie, let\u2019s go onto the next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning, Mark. Mark Rohr : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: There are a lot of moving parts in Acetyl\u2019s cost curve. Chinese coal prices have come down, so that should benefit you there. In the U.S. your advantage has declined, but also methanol has come down quite a bit. So you\u2019re buying methanol and that should be a benefit. So can you just sort of put all that together and walk us through the Acetyl\u2019s cost curve and how it stands today? Mark Rohr : Yes. So if you, I think, my best on that, I think, as basis coal has come down in China quite dramatically and methanol has come down quite dramatically. The \u2013 probably the biggest factor has been the consumption trend of methanol. There was a lot of methanol embedded in China, a lot of methanol plants built in anticipation of tremendous demand for methanol to olefins, P.J., and that\u2019s not quite played out as people anticipated. So we find ourselves a bit long on methanol or longer on methanol than we\u2019d like, so methanol prices have come down. What that does, it tends to push down the cost pretty dramatically in the Acetyl chain. And so we\u2019ve seen Acetyl cost go down, and we\u2019ll also see Acetyl margins collapse a bit in China, as demand for the Acetyl products has been pretty weak. So that\u2019s a little bit of a world standard, if I can say that P.J. And methanol prices in the U.S. have backed up to basically China pricing less freight. So you\u2019ve seen U.S. prices dropped quite sharply in the U.S. for methanol. So when you roll all that together what I will say is that the U.S. continues to be hands down the lowest cost producer of Acetyl products. I think you\u2019re seeing with oil prices at their current levels you\u2019re seeing in Singapore in oil base in that same range. And you\u2019re seeing China versus those two be quite disadvantage. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, interesting. Thank you for that. Mark Rohr : Sure. P.J. Juvekar: And then question on AEM margin expansion. You did a good job of keeping the price while raw materials went down. So is that an initial benefit and would your customers look for some take backs on that and how do you see that playing out? Thank you. Mark Rohr : Well, I think, thanks P.J. I think we have been resolute there. We\u2019ve actually have \u2013 we\u2019ve lost some volume in some cases, because we were so tough in that regard. And so I think this kind of necessary outcome you\u2019ve got to find that line, and so we found in a couple places and we have to rethink that and go recapture that volume probably at a lower price in some cases. I think what I see today and the material space, people still are quite driven for a better solution. And I gave that one example just one example of the sunroof application, where you can find ways to not only meet weight or performance criteria, but you can also improve throughput. So in that case, this company got a much, much better product and solves a lot of needs they have plus they got a higher throughput. We can price that product higher, and they\u2019re happy, they\u2019re still making more money and the OEM is happier. So that that is desire on the part of our customers and I think those opportunities these new product launches really give us ability to hold our net margins out there and I say hold, because you\u2019re going to get some deterioration and I mean two product as deflation continues to hit us. P.J. Juvekar: That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Sure. Chuck Kyrish : All right. Thank you, P.J. Carrie, let\u2019s go onto the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Ryan Berney : Good morning. This is Ryan Berney on for Bob. I just had a question kind of trimming on back of P.J.\u2019s question there on, it seems like you\u2019re really try to aiming for kind of pricing per value in your discussions with your customers. So I think my question is, assuming we start to see some tick up in oil prices some time over the next year or two. Is there any ability for you to push that price back there, or do you feel like the customers will kind of use that against you on that side, and there will be kind of a little bit of shrink there? Mark Rohr : Well, I think for the most part, we structure our contracts where we have the ability to push through inflation. When you price for value you kind of \u2013 you move away from that equation a little bit. So you have a discreet transaction about the value equation you\u2019re bringing, so raws don\u2019t enter in that debate. So what I would say with that is that everything new that we\u2019ve rolled into. We\u2019ll have that priced in the value equation. The legacy products you\u2019ll have to work that through if that makes sense. So short-term impact could occur if oil popped back up to $100 a barrel. But I don\u2019t think our contract base would be very lasting for us, we pretty quickly pass it through. Ryan Berney : Great, thanks. And then maybe I could also ask if kind of in your comments around the destocking in light of the leg down in the commodity prices. Does that mean that you feel like deflation is nearing an end, maybe if there is some also maybe the kind of the follow through that perhaps the destocking is over to or is that not what you meant? Mark Rohr : I think when you look at it, if you take the time which we\u2019ve done is and you really plot out currency, you plot out all the raw materials that are out there in the world. What you will see is, if there has been, for the most part things have trended down and have started to operate at a relatively constant levels that makes sense. It\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t want to forecast we\u2019re totally at the bottom yet. But I think for the most part $30 oil is going to move to the system if I could use that as an example. And maybe we\u2019re 80% of the way there or something, but we\u2019re not 20%. So my kind of view is that the first-half of this year is going to be us establishing that foundation at bottom and then things will start to move up from that. Ryan Berney : Great, thanks. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Ryan. Carrie, let\u2019s move onto next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi, good morning, Mark. There\u2019s all kinds of controversy as to whether China is going to have a hard landing or a soft landing? Do you have any opinions on that subject, given how larger your operations is there? Mark Rohr : Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 we still have opinions, Jeff. I\u2019m not sure how you should weigh them.But what we see when we go there and engage with all of the customers we have in China and even government officials is that, they have a pretty clear view of where they are. And that view as they\u2019re on a journey to transition that economy, they feel pretty comfortable with demand. So I know we sit and like to lay claim that their GDP growth is not what they say. And I think I would kind of dispute that, I think, it\u2019s exactly what they say. The flip side is, there is not any kind of businesses that most of the chemical industry is in. So we\u2019re seeing much lower growth rates. So my kind of gut is, when I listen to those guys, when I see the construction under way and I see the consumer appetite, which we\u2019re enjoying a lot of success with, I think, China is not as bad in as bad a situation as everybody professes to be. I think it is tough in some sectors, and it\u2019s certainly tough the closer you are to raw materials and manufacturing, but it\u2019s also doing really, really well. In the consumer arena, it\u2019s doing really well in areas away from the coast. So my \u2013 kind of my gut is, Jeff, what I would say is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in right fall off the face of the earth, I think, it\u2019s going to be a \u2013 in some way it\u2019s a low year in China, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a continued deterioration in china. Jeffrey Zekauskas : And then lastly with the AI result. Do you think that they\u2019re now representative of what the first-half is going to look like, or is the trend in margins up or down as best as you can tell? Mark Rohr : Yes, Jeff, it\u2019s all went there. I think fundamentally what we\u2019re seeing is that the \u2013 what we\u2019re expecting is business trends kinds of as they are now to stay kind of as they are for a bit. We\u2019re not expecting a lot of activity, anything great to happen. And I think probably we\u2019ve already entered Chinese New Year is our kind of reality. So I think the first-half of the year is going to be the weaker half for us if I can say that, but that\u2019s kind of consistent with the trends and how we close the year. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Great. Thank you, Jeff. Carrie, let\u2019s move on to next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Wanted to revisit the AI segment. Obviously you\u2019re a bit confusing, we saw EBITDA margins at around 22% in Q1 of 2015. And in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re less than 14%. And along that period obviously, we\u2019ve seen some steep declines in methanol pricing? So the first part of the question is how much today are these AI margins a function of methanol pricing. Meaning, I mean, with the ebbs and flows in methanol pricing should we continue to expect this volatility in AI margins? And part and parcel with that question basically is that in the past you had talked about a more normal or sustainable AI EBIT margin of 15%, so call it around an 18% EBITDA margin. And it seems from your earlier remarks that now you\u2019re guiding to a lower sort of sustainable level of margins, is that correct? Mark Rohr : Well you asked a lot of questions here boss. Let me backup a little bit so\u2026 Hassan Ahmed : I mean, in a nutshell I\u2019m just trying to figure out sustainable AI margins going forward in the current raw material pricing environment? Mark Rohr : Yes. So we\u2019re in a transition environment is what I would say right now. So the margins have been compressed especially in Asia dramatically compressed really driven by weak demand and collapse in raw materials. So we\u2019ve seen a real margin compression in Asia and that\u2019s leaked a little bit around the world if I can say. Although there\u2019s not a lot of moving material outside of Asia. And so that\u2019s been part of the margin compression. The other part is that some of those numbers you quoted were based on a time when there was \u2013 have been a very unusual series of outages in the VAM industry and that would certainly contribute in a very favorable way to those margins. So we\u2019ve always said that we believe through thick and think 15 is a right place to be, sometimes it would be a bit harder than that sometimes it would be lower than that on those margins. So I don\u2019t see if I could say that, I don\u2019t see the situation we\u2019re being in now is a situation that\u2019s going to continue. I think the margin in China will slowly start to improve in that process. And so I\u2019m expecting we\u2019ll be able to draw margins backup to a 15 and above before too long. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. And as a follow-up, you touched upon the China earlier. Obviously, since the end of last year, there have been some dramatic feedstock cost escalations in Saudi Arabia. What sort of EBITDA hit should we expect out of Mecina from the sort of feedstock cost escalation in Saudi? Chris Jensen : For this year it\u2019s down $30 million now that 30 half of that or so is increased costs that we\u2019re going through. Mark Rohr : Yes, Chris \u2013 it\u2019s probably a little less than that. It\u2019s the raw that\u2019s more the pricing. They also have some major turnarounds that essentially take them. Chris Jensen : So call it $10 million for\u2026 Mark Rohr : Yes. Chris Jensen : The input costs associated with the changes, sorry revenue, yes. Hassan Ahmed : Got it. Very good. Thanks so much, guys. Chris Jensen : Thank you, Hassan. Chuck.Kyrish: Thank you. So, Carrie, let\u2019s move onto the next one. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Mark. You mentioned productivity contributed about $100 million in 2015. How much do you expect your productivity initiatives to contribute in 2016? Mark Rohr : Well, we needed to be the same number. So that\u2019s why we baked into our plans and that\u2019s where we\u2019re working for another $100 million. Jim Sheehan : Okay. Also on your intentions for your expansion in the U.S. Gulf Coast Bishop more particularly, do the lower oil prices affect your willingness to spend capital expanding there? Mark Rohr : No, I think, we have the ability to make those expansions in a very, very cost effective way and we\u2019re seeing pretty strong growth demand in those products. So no, it doesn\u2019t impact us at all. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot. Chuck.Kyrish: Great. Thank you, Jim. Carrie, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Alexi Yefremov of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Alexi Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you Did your fourth quarter results in Acetyl\u2019s include any sort of one-time negative impact, such as de-stocking or inventory holding losses and maybe excessive downtime at Nanjing and Singapore? Mark Rohr : Well, there were few one-time items in there. We had an inventory correction in there. The hit is, we have some barges that didn\u2019t ship out. Those together were $8 to $10 million I think of one-time kind of impact in that business, I\u2019m looking at Chris, but I don\u2019t\u2026. Chris Jensen : That\u2019s about right. Mark Rohr : I think that\u2019s \u2013 well, I\u2019ll say it\u2019s about \u2013 it would be limited $10 million, I think is what I would say. Alexi Yefremov : All right. Thank you, Mark. And more broadly, did you experience destocking across your businesses elsewhere? Mark Rohr : Yes, I don\u2019t know so far as to say destocking. I think you broadly have a reluctant customer out in the world today, where they just don\u2019t want to buy. So you\u2019re seeing people kind of just not delay purchasing is almost what they\u2019re doing, if that makes sense. So I think the flush-through if there has been enough oversupply has already kind of occurred and now we have people hanging around trying to see if we were at the bottom yet or if the market is going to start improving. So it\u2019s more weak consumer. Alexi Yefremov : Got it. Thanks a lot. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Carrie. Let\u2019s move onto the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thank you. Just had a question, you\u2019ve got it to 5% to 10% EPS growth. Can you just help us understand the levers that would get you to the upper end of that? Is it mainly macro stuff, or is it stuff within your control? Mark Rohr : No, I think you get the upper end of that, we need the second-half to be materially stronger than the first-half. Now, we think that may happen. But in the lower end of the range you have seen things, we think we can control and the upper hand is we need some help from the global economy. Arun Viswanathan : So, just specifically on that then, maybe you can just elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing in the end markets? Is there a chance that tow will be down next year? And then also in autos have you seen any kind of skittishness? Are we peaking at levels where we are now, similarly in China and then in Europe as well, what are you hearing from your customers? Mark Rohr : Yes, I\u2019ll just run through a few things and ask Chris to hop in here in just a minute. Yes you should have a view that we\u2019ve kind of factored in tow being weaker this year than last year. And we\u2019re not in a position to say exactly, because contracts are still under way, but we believe in those numbers we put out there that tow is going to be a bit weaker year-over-year in there, that\u2019s on the negative side. On the positive side in there it\u2019s clear that I think most \u2013 the conventional wisdom is that autos have peaked, even though we\u2019re seeing forecast of roughly a 3% growth rate year-over-year globally in autos. We drill into that what\u2019s going in autos, though, is that the opportunities remain very, very strong for us. And just tremendous interest in our products, we\u2019ve got almost more things to work on that we can \u2013 that we can handle. So we think that autos are going to be continue to be a good story for us and industry materials is going to be continue to be very good story even in this weak market. When you look at the Acetyl Chain, the closer you are to the consumer, our industrial specialties business, we\u2019ve had great success there this last year when predicting that to continue. In this year and we\u2019re predicting that that areas away from China we got start to have a bigger impact on our business. And you may know we\u2019re expanding a plant or building a plant in Singapore that will be completed this year. And so we\u2019re doing a lot of prep work relative to that. I mentioned the Singapore in situation and the economic situation there that\u2019s been improved as we negotiated in the supply agreement. We think there will be opportunity to take advantage of that and extract more value out of Southeast Asia than we have in the past. So when you roll all those things up and don\u2019t discount our productivity efforts which are very strong with us, that\u2019s where we get in the 5% kind of range. And so we feel pretty good about that number. I think when you look at the 10%, we need a little bit of bounce here in this marketplace and we need demand to pick up a little bit stronger than it is right now. Chris Jensen : The only thing that I\u2019d add to what Mark said just reiterate we\u2019re going to drive productivity, we\u2019re shooting for $100 million. The other thing I\u2019d remind you is you saw us take a number of actions to control, what we can control around our footprint, around contract structure, and we did those things knowing that we\u2019re in a tough environment and we\u2019re going to do, we can do to push on cost and structure contracts the way we wanted to structure. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Arun. Carrie, let\u2019s move onto the next question and let\u2019s have this be the last series of questions. Operator : All right. Our last question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Within engineered materials what were the strongest areas and also what were the weaker ones then that offset the strength in some of the strong areas? I mean, is it year-over-year volume \u2013 year-over-year sales were relatively flat, I think, or volumes were relatively flat? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think the strongest areas, I mean, I\u2019m going to speak a bit generically for us. We\u2019ve had some really good success with products that we\u2019re bringing into in the consumer markets like appliances and durable goods, washing machine, things like that dish washers that have opened up some real opportunities for us that they were not there in the past. We\u2019ve had in auto more success and it\u2019s reflected in numbers getting our products built in the new models that are going to start coming on for us this year and next that are out there. We\u2019ve also have some good success with composites, as we\u2019re seeing more and more interest in thermoplastic versus thermoset composites in a number of applications. Those areas I would say we\u2019ve probably done the best and I feel Poly has been a great success for us and it\u2019s keying up some real strong increase profitability as the folks deal with the temperature, the need to really move deal with a hot temperature from LED lighting and things like that, those areas have been really strong for us. John Roberts : But you were flat year-over-year in volumes, so what were the offsetting areas? Mark Rohr : Well, the offsetting areas is where I was jacking price too much and I got rejected. So it wasn\u2019t so much a market offset as it us pushing harder than perhaps I should push. John Roberts : And then as a follow up, most of your engineered plastics have some vertical integration advantages. As you grow the nylon platform, whether you do it organically, inorganically, is there a vertical integration strategy that will follow from the products launch strategy? Mark Rohr : I think, I guess, there\u2019s two parts to that. It\u2019s it\u2019s often quite nicely vertically integrated. But it can often be a disadvantage too if you\u2019ve got a business that doesn\u2019t return as cost of capital on the manufacturing sector. So we\u2019re trying not to constrain ourselves and require ourselves to be vertically integrated. So in a case of nylon, we\u2019ve got great technology, we\u2019re getting in the market. We continue to look for opportunities to vertically integrate. And so if we can find those in a way that will be good for us and our shareholders will take advantage of that. But we don\u2019t want to require that to be in these markets. John Roberts : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, John. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time this morning. We\u2019ll be around for questions later today. Carrie, at this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Operator : All right. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Kyrish. Please go ahead. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Carrie. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The Celanese Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation\u2019s future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release, non-GAAP reconciliations, presentation and prepared comments have been submitted to the SEC in a current report on Form 8-K. This morning, we\u2019ll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr, and then we\u2019ll field your questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with the earnings, so I\u2019ll keep my comments brief and then open the line for your questions. Today I'm very pleased to report first quarter adjusted earnings of $1.83 per share, representing growth of 6% versus the prior year and setting a new performance record for Celanese. Adjusted EBIT for the quarter was our highest ever at $358 million, growth of 2% year-over-year and driven by record performance in Materials Solutions and resilient performance across the Acetyl Chain while facing a very difficult Chinese market. Our adjusted EBIT margin was a record of 25.5% expanding 140 basis points year-over-year and a reflection of our broad-based productivity efforts and underlying business performance. This quarter our businesses continued their pace of consistent cash generation, achieving $217 million of free cash flow. We deleveraged our balance sheet by $405 million in the quarter and still ended with $716 million of cash on hand. Looking ahead, I'd like to share earnings - our current thoughts on a quarterly trajectory of our earnings for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we see headwinds of roughly $0.30 to $0.35 and as versus the first quarter. This is primarily due to our heavy turnaround period, which will include the first turnaround of our Engineered Materials plant in Frankfurt as well as several VAM facilities around the world. We also have an updated expectation for our affiliate earnings headwinds on an annual basis. Due to further deterioration in netbacks on MTBE, we now expect IBN Sina affiliate earnings to be lower by $50 million in 2016. This is $20 million worse than we expected in January, or roughly $0.10 per share over the rest of the year. When we roll it up for the year considering the economic backdrop and the strategies we have in place, we have line of sight to growth and adjusted earnings per share of about 8% to 10%. As I\u2019ve said earlier, to achieve the high-end of that range we will need some level of economic recovery in the second half to help us overcome a good bit of our fourth quarter seasonality. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck for Q&A. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks Mark. As a reminder, we\u2019d like everybody to limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. Carrie, let's please go ahead and get started. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Hi Laurence. Laurence Alexander : I guess two quick ones. Can you give a little bit more detail on how your thinking has evolved on consumer fibers? And also can you give some detail on how much shares you bought in the quarter, and which you see as the cadence for the year? Mark Rohr : Yes. Well, I\u2019ll do the first, and I\u2019ll let Chris do the second, Laurence, if that\u2019s okay. What we've been communicating for a while on our fibers business has been really the story of de-stocking the world and primarily that in China, and I think all of the guys that followed the slides have a view that we've gone as an industry from being able to sell into China roughly 120,000 to 130,000 tonnes down to a level that\u2019s roughly 25% of that today. So the vast majority of that shrinkage in terms of sales in the China has in fact occurred. You saw some of that in our volumes this quarter. We took the first big hit on that reduction - the material hit in the first quarter of last year, so you see some of that year-over-year change as we go forward. So our view is that, that business is kind of as advertised we think that the de-stocking outside of Europe is largely run its course, and there is even some signs of some small subtle volume increases outside of China. When you get into China, we think it's pretty stable as we go through the rest of this year with the current level we\u2019re at. We have expected over time of course that last for many bit, we'll work out the system as well. Net-net for the year, we've said, all along, we\u2019re going to work hard to try to keep our earnings flat. We still are working to do that, and I don't have anything else to report on that front. So, Chris, you want to update us on shares? Chris Jensen : Sure. So really good cash generation quarter for us and we\u2019re in a great position now to go execute on that commitment to repurchase shares. As Mark mentioned, we have over $700 million, and more than half of that is now in the U.S. and that's a key to then going out to execute on the repurchases. You'll also notice that following that revolver draw last year to do repurchases, that we paid that off in the first quarter. So that was our focus in terms of cash flows this quarter, so we will get after it and expect to probably do half of that $1 billion through the remainder of the year. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Laurence. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. Carrie, let's please go to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up or two on the tow business. It seemed to me that the volume was probably better than you were expecting in the quarter, so I just want to see whether that's true or not, or maybe you're going to say that it was better in the quarter, but it\u2019s going to be different over the balance of the year, so the full-year expectation is the same. But on the 9% negative pricing, I presume we should assume that for the balance of the year just given the contract nature of the business. And do you have any thoughts on pricing? It\u2019s obviously early to head into next year, but do you think - you\u2019re saying sort of the tow volume has flattened out. So should that mean or should that imply that pricing is going to flatten out as well? Mark Rohr : Yes, thanks, Vincent. So if you look at that from a point of view, I think we expected the rebound in volume just because first quarter of last year we really took it on China [ph] as everything was shut down and we had going in the China, so first quarter of last year was an aberration in terms of its depth. We have got our little bit of extra volume in this first quarter that probably will not repeat in the second and third quarter that just came to us as demands picked up outside of China. So I think you should have a view that that swing from the low the first quarter to this quarter was kind of above to those little bit aberration, that\u2019s going to settle out for an average little bit lower where we currently are as we go through the rest of this year. I think on price, you're absolutely right. These prices are set really as we - kind of as we end the year, so the run rate on pricing, that delta year-over-year is going to kind of ride with us through the rest of the year. And net-net when we roll that up, including our productivity efforts and things we are doing to try to offset some of that, we are shooting out to be flat year-over-year. If I look at pricing going forward, I think we really - China needs to sort itself out is what I would say with that, Vincent. China needs to have some stability to it and not continue to slide for us to start having a view that we could work pricing backup. So I don't know if it's going to be able to go up next year or maybe the year after that. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Okay. Carrie, let's go to the next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Mark, back in November you discussed the M&A focus of the company. Any progress on the M&A activity, especially in AEM? Mark Rohr : Yes, I wish I could share everything with you, David, but I can't. Yes, there is a lot of progress and we're working several deals that fit in that bolt-on category hard, and I hope that in the quarters ahead we\u2019ll be able to announce those deals. Chris Jensen : As I mentioned David, we paid off the revolver. We want that ready to go. David Begleiter : Very clear. And lastly, Mark, just on acetyls in China, you mentioned again a very difficult market there. What changes that situation in the near or medium term? Mark Rohr : Well, it is a real pig\u2019s breakfast over there, David. It's just tremendous overcapacity and the deflationary environment has pushed down acid margins to pretty pathetic levels. What we are seeing though is we are seeing people start to roll over. What I mean by that is they are stayed on enterprises in this arena have a higher massive layoff. It's not a sustainable level. So my kind of view is that even with the overcapacity this year, we are going to see that start to drift up a bit as we get into this year. It is going to take industry rationalization for that to change. It\u2019s going to take the new MTO plants to come on line for that to change. I think both of those things are needed. With ethylene prices being what they are in China, there is pretty good opportunity for MTOs. So we are a little bit hopeful that that's going to move in and start driving methanol. But I wouldn't expect there to be an overnight change in the Chinese market. David Begleiter : Understood. Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thanks David. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Thanks. Carrie, let's go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentlemen. This is normally the part where I talk about what a phenomenal quarter you had, but last year you guys upsided by $0.41 and this year only $0.34. Why the slippage? Mark Rohr : I know, Frank, we are struggling. Frank Mitsch : Really good job. Hey, look, I want to quickly follow-up on the M&A question. Obviously in November, you did talk specifically about Nylon. And I believe in your prepared remarks, you also referenced doing some things in Nylon technology but it seems that you were doing that on your own. Can you elaborate on what's going on and your interest in Nylon and what's going on there? Mark Rohr : Yes, we are very interested and obviously in autos, Nylon is a big play in autos. And the way this industry works, Frank, is when customers have challenges they invite in people that have portfolios or history in those markets. So we've been working hard to get at the table when Nylon topics are discussed and that's been the advice of some of our friends in the industry, so our focus has been there. We've recently introduced some of our own technology and compounding this pretty novel and unique and so we\u2019re now selling very small quantities but now selling Nylon. A big portion of M&A focus is in that regard to bring in Nylon. So that's the reason. We think most of that growth in the industry from a thermoplastic point of view will be in Nylon. Frank Mitsch : All right, terrific. And then just quickly, you also mentioned in the prepared remarks some benefit from a VAM contract reset. How lucrative was that for you in the quarter, or expected for the year? Mark Rohr : Well, there was just one time - we\u2019re trying to signal a one-time impact, and we'll give you the exact number there but you need to think in terms of less than single-digit earnings per share impact for the quarter. Frank Mitsch : Terrific. Mark Rohr : Yes. Frank Mitsch : All right. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Yes, sir. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Thank you. Carrie, let's go to the next question please. Operator : All right. Our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Mark, you had a big sequential jump in acetyls profitability, the intermediates business. Can you explain how much of that is - that came from sort of going to spot pricing and what you had talked about shifting some contracts versus how much benefit did you get from raw materials? Mark Rohr : Well, there is lot of gives and takes in that. What we saw in the fourth quarter over a real high-level is we saw sort of the worse of the worst of the Chinese market, so there is the underlying thematic [ph] there that I just need to reflect on. You also had, within that chain, the seasonality impacts of the emulsion product line, so it also weighs it down. So now the first quarter we've had some basic improvement in China, not a lot P.J., but enough to where it is noticeable to us. And then we've also seen emulsions start to do better as we get into seasonality time, especially in Europe. So you\u2019ve got those big two swaps there. When you look at raw materials, I'm almost feel better talking about that on an annual basis, but the big movers for us in raw materials have been ethylene. And if you look at first to fourth quarter, there was probably - around the world, there was probably a $5 million or $6 million favorable impact for us on ethylene, so pretty modest but nonetheless some of that was realized, some of it wasn\u2019t realized say it. But that's the kind of impact we've seen in raws. Methanol has been more favorable with most our favorability has been in Asia, P.J., where it's been really hard to capture any of that. So we see most of our favorability occurring in ethylene, and I'd say a little bit in nat gas, which is a few million dollars around the world. Chris Jensen : P.J., it\u2019s Chris. I'll add a couple of things there. So there is - you get into some timing around U.S. methanol if you think through the way that played out last year. So I think your question was kind of sequential from the fourth quarter, so we were still using some methanol in the U.S. in the fourth quarter that was procured in the third quarter, so that\u2019s more expensive than our ongoing produced cost of methanol in the first quarter. Remember also that we have a new contract in Singapore for carbon monoxide, so you're seeing that benefit come on now as well. We impaired that ethanol plant as discussed before, so you get a little bit of benefit that you see in the first quarter from depreciation going down. You'll recall various footprint activities in emulsions that you now seeing paying off in terms of lower fixed costs and then the business has just continued to do a great job on productivity, and we continue to see progress and visibility to another kind of $100 million number in productivity this year. Back to your specific question, there is just a whole lot of those small things that really added up to quite a big sequential jump in the acetyls core. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. That's helpful. And, Mark, correct me if I'm wrong, but you see more positive on China compared to one or two quarters ago, so am I reading that right? Mark Rohr : Well, yes, probably so, P.J. I think if you asked me to quantify that buddy, it's hard to do that. But just on a qualitative basis, when we are out and about, no one can tolerate this situation, and so you're seeing people start to reach out, look for ways to get out of this chronic overcapacity situation. So my view is that as we go through the year that some of this stuff is going to get resolved. It's just - it's unsustainable where it is P.J., and I guess that's what my optimism really is. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Carrie, let's go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Mark, I'm curious how do you see the AEM business in terms of consistency going forward? You had a very nice volume number this quarter. Is that something thing that's sustainable? What do you think the secular growth rate of that division is from a volume standpoint? Mark Rohr : Well, I think we did have - we have a really good success this quarter. We are expecting - and to be honest, we need to grow that kind of rate on an annualized basis certainly through this year, Bob. And so we're working hard to try to achieve that. We've seen some moderation in things like auto builds and stuff that of course we have to make sure we overcome as we go forward. So that's how I would look at that. We reported that we had over 300 new projects for the quarter, which puts us at a 1,200 kind of project run rate. You'll recall that last year we ended with little bit over a 1,000, and we are trying to march that up to 2,000 within a couple of more years. I think we've got a machine to do that, so we believe that machine is working pretty well and we are seeing good bit of volume being realized from these kind of activities. Bob Koort : And Chris, I'm just curious on the Acetyl Chain. Is the impact of the ethanol write-down and the CO contract termination, is that material on a quarterly basis until UFOs [ph] or no? Chris Jensen : The ethanol depreciation is pretty small. The Singapore contract is a little bigger than that but we are still in single digits for the quarter sequentially. Bob Koort : Got it. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Great. Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Carrie, let's go to the next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : I think your AEM margins on an EBIT basis were up about 700 basis points year-over-year on roughly flat revenues. How did you do that, and do you expect them to improve from here? Chris Jensen : Which margin? When you say margin, what line are you looking at? Do you mean\u2026 Jeff Zekauskas : I\u2019m sorry. Your EBIT versus your revenues. Chris Jensen : Okay. So your question was which period versus which period? Jeff Zekauskas : Forgive me. So in your first quarter, I think you earned around $89 million on $350 million in revenues, and last year I think you earned about $61 million on $343 million. Chris Jensen : So, are you pulling out the affiliates in that math? Is that what you're doing? Jeff Zekauskas : Yes, I am pulling out the affiliates? Chris Jensen : Okay. So Q1 to Q1 without affiliates. So you\u2019ve got good volume growth like we talked about. Jeff Zekauskas : Sure. Chris Jensen : You do have year-over-year, you\u2019ve got some benefit from lower raw materials. You have continued productivity actions and you have some energy price benefits. So you add those things together, that's what\u2019s contributing to that margin climb. Jeff Zekauskas : In general for the company, do you feel like your raw material spreads are widening out or contracting? Mark Rohr : Well, I think you asked a great question Jeff. Directionally over time they would contract. And to be honest, I haven't dug into it really rigorously to see how much real contraction occurred across the 5,000 SKUs we have quarter to quarter, but directionally as prices settle in then there will be some contraction. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot, Jeff. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Carrie, let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed of Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : The $0.30 to $0.35 EPS headwind relative to Q1 guidance that you gave, I know you talked about an element of that being turnarounds and an element of that being sort of the captured opportunity in Q1 in acetyls. Am I understanding it correctly that the acetyls contribution to that $0.30 to $0.35 headwind was in the single digits? Mark Rohr : The acetyl contribution - yes, the incremental volume? Yes, that's right. Hassan Ahmed : Okay. Fair enough. Mark Rohr : The majority of that is the turnarounds and we've never taken an outage at the new POM facility, and from a statutory point of view we have to basically go into every vessel and do a bunch of testing from a German statutory point of view, so there is a huge outage and a huge cost to us there and then we have a series of VAM outrageous. So the lion\u2019s share of that $0.30 was, call it, those two outages that occurred. Hassan Ahmed : Understood. Now on the tow side of things, as I understand it, there was some new regulations as far as cigarette packs go in India commencing April 1, and my understanding is that cigarette manufacturers in India have halted production right now. How should we be thinking about that as it pertains to be at volumes or pricing or the like? I mean, completely understand that you guys are far more China exposed, but these things potentially could have ripple effects? Mark Rohr : Well, what we've - I think if you are asking about long-term consumptive effects, we don't anticipate that there is any real difference in that ongoing decline curve that is expected. In a short-term basis, there was a little bit of volume you could probably attribute to production under the old labeling rules versus the new labeling rules that occurred in the first part of the year but it wasn't material. Hassan Ahmed : Got it. And you don't expect it to be material through the course of Q2 as well? Mark Rohr : No, I think it's kind of run its course now. So yes, you come up from a point of view impact in sales now we've seen those indication from the cigarette manufacturers that they expect sales will be impacted because of it. Hassan Ahmed : Got it. Perfect. Thanks so much, Mark. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Thanks. Carrie, let's go to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : Good morning. On the $100 million in productivity gain that you expect for the year, how much did you achieve in the first quarter? Chris Jensen : More than a quarter of it. Jim Sheehan : Great. And could you also elaborate on other activities? Why was that lower-than-expected? Chris Jensen : Well, we try to not spend money unless we have to do, so that should be good news. Look, there is such a \u2013I'm going to go back to Mark's words and tell you that it's a pig\u2019s breakfast. There is just a lot of different things that sit in that other category. That number is probably low relative to what we would expect for the rest of the year. If you go look last year, kind of the same thing happened, and then Q2, Q3, Q4 were more $20 million range, so I think it's going to be at least there for the rest of the year. I mean, there is just a long list of puts and takes there. There were some currency benefits in the first quarter. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Jim, our productivity we - you should think, in the past, we had some big productivity numbers and what's nice about our machine is that we've evolved into dealing with much smaller numbers and do that quite well. So we have like hundreds of programs in place to drive and make sure we achieve that $100 million year-over-year, and those things aren\u2019t - they are not totally writable, some occur early, some occur later in the system. Jim Sheehan : Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thanks Jim. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Thanks. Carrie, let's go to next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexi Yefremov of Nomura. Please go ahead. Alexi Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Alexi Yefremov : In AEM, did you build any inventory ahead of turnaround of Frankfurt, and if so, did it impact your cost basis in Q1? Chris Jensen : When we talk about the costs of turnaround and those headwinds in the second quarter, that includes both the direct cost of the turnaround as well as the inventory draw impact because we\u2019ll be drawing inventories during that period. Alexi Yefremov : Okay, thank you. And back to acetate tow, do you expect to take market share in tow this year? And a related question, do you think your price declines in filter tow this year are consistent with what your major competitors will show in their result as well? Mark Rohr : No, so I don't think there is any material market share on part of our efforts. I mean, some customers may sell more cigarettes than other customers, so you may get - how to do I say that - the cigarette manufacturers may change market share which could impact us if we are supplying somebody is not doing quite as well in the marketplace. But in terms of our efforts, no, we don't see any real shift in market share. Consistent? Yes, I think we are all in the same kind of boat. So my gut is they will be in the same kind of range, yes. Alexi Yefremov : Great. Thanks a lot, Mark. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Carrie, let's move to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Arun Viswanathan : I just want to ask a similar question. I guess, you guys had very impressive volume performance year-on-year, some of that was due to the easy comps. But on the pricing side, I guess, do you expect these kinds of moves down on price as we go through the year, and especially in the downstream business and AEM or consumer specialties? Mark Rohr : Well, I think - yes, it's a great question. It\u2019s a function really of what raw materials are going to do and overall demand in the marketplace. We are hopeful that as we go through the year, demand will start to pick-up in some of our business, which will support pricing initiatives a bit better than we have seen in the last several months or several quarters. So I think what I\u2019d say is I expect our - kind of our pricing to be relatively consistent with what it is now and trending up as we go through the year. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. And then just on the uses of cash, you did pay down some debt in the quarter. Has that run its course and what are your focuses and priorities, I guess, if you could bucket them on M&A versus buybacks? Chris Jensen : On the buybacks, we planned to do $1 billion in 2016 and 2017, so we'll probably try to do half of that this year. Acquisitions, it depends on the size of the acquisition. If they are small, we might pay cash for them. If they are larger, there will be leverage involved. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. Let's move on to the next question, Carrie. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John, your line is open if you would like to ask a question. Perhaps your line is on mute. Chuck Kyrish : Okay, we will come back. Operator : All right. Our next question and the last in our queue for today, comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA. Please go ahead. Nils Wallin : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Mark Rohr : Sure. Nils Wallin : I was curious about the varying levels of GDP forecast you have behind your expectation for the rest of the year in order to hit the 10% earnings growth. What type of economic growth do you see as needed in order to get at the top end? Mark Rohr : Yes, I wish I was a good man. We could just still GDP down into what our customer demand forecast is, so we are currently get us customer demand as opposed to national and international demand. So I don't know that we really have a strong view on GDP. What's clear is that GDP growth globally is kind of moderating, and so our philosophy is we\u2019ve got to go out and earn this business. And the material side to substitution which is a big part of our play, so we try to grow our market share by not in the similar way but from taking someone else's product, a polypropylene product and selling our product in its place as an example. So a lot of the growth in AEM that we are working on is these new projects we have in new introductions, and we think that as we go through the year that will continue to build for us. In acetyls, we are expecting that the - and this is as much GDP driven as it is just misery index. We think the misery index in China in manufacturing is so high, it cannot last. And we do expect to see some improvement as we go through the year in that regard. And I don't know that\u2019s really going to be reflected in any kind of big uptick in Chinese GDP. Nils Wallin : Understood. And just to follow-up. Your SG&A numbers were down pretty significantly year-over-year and sequentially. Is all of that productivity, or were there other some - other unique, I don't want to call it non-recurring, but other unique events that allowed you to do so well on the SG&A line and how sustainable is that? Chris Jensen : Let me ask you which period speaking specifically you're talking about? Do you mean Q1\u2026 Nils Wallin : Both sequentially Q1 versus\u2026 Chris Jensen : Yes, if you're looking sequentially, that Q4 SG&A number has potential mark-to-market in it, so it's... Nils Wallin : Excluding that of course. Chris Jensen : So you\u2019ve done that math, okay. Well, I mean what we're expecting in SG&A is the continuation of downward trend from our productivity initiatives. Now you can get currency impacts in there for the periods that you're talking about, but part of the decline from \u201814 to \u201815 would have been currency related. Nils Wallin : Understood. So you expect that level to pretty much sustain itself in Q1? Mark Rohr : Yes, in absolute dollars, yes. And we expect them to trend down, but really on a big year-over-year kind of comp basis, so lot of our SG&A related productivity came in, in the middle part of last year and clearly towards the end. So you get a little bit bigger comp probably first and second quarter this year versus last year than you will in the trailing quarters. Nils Wallin : Got it. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Okay, Great. Thanks Nils. Well, we appreciate everyone\u2019s time this morning and we\u2019ll be around for questions later today. Carrie, at this point I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference is now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

Please note the cautionary language contained in the (1:34) slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. This morning we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then we'll field your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings, so I'll keep my comments brief and open the line for your questions. For the quarter, I am pleased to report GAAP diluted earnings of $1.50 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.59 per share. We generated year-over-year growth despite roughly $0.20 of headwinds from planned turnaround activity in the quarter, including the first-ever turnaround at our POM facility in Frankfurt, Germany. Our operations team did a terrific job planning and executing multiple turnarounds in the quarter. I'd like to thank them for getting this up and running safely and on schedule. Segment income for the quarter was $312 million and we expanded our margin by 110 basis points over the prior year to 23.1%, reflective of continued momentum in our Engineered Materials business, resilient performance in the Acetyl Chain and focused productivity actions. In Engineered Materials, we grew volumes 8% year-over-year across an increasingly diverse set of end uses. We launched a record number of new projects in the quarter at 335 and remain on track to achieve our ambitious goal of 1,200 new product launches for the year. We generated a record free cash flow in the quarter and our balance sheet stands in a strong position, evidenced by the upgrade in our credit ratings to investment grade by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. This upgrade validates the tremendous progress we have made over the last several years to strengthen our businesses and deleverage our balance sheet, and it's a natural step in the evolution of Celanese. We also returned over $250 million in cash to our shareholders in the quarter, deploying $200 million in cash to repurchase 2.8 million shares and paying $54 million in dividends. Looking through the remainder of 2016, we see the economic landscape in the U.S. and Europe as relatively stable. In China, we are having great success in industry materials driven by trends in the use of specialty materials, while at the same time the Acetyl Chain continues to deal with historically low acetic acid margins. As always, we focus on what we can control to serve our customers and drive a differentiated result regardless of prevailing economic conditions. The strength we have built in our commercial models combined with our ability to consistently drive productivity gains has allowed us to overcome unprecedented challenges and headwinds while consistently growing our earnings and cash flow. We are maintaining our view of 8% to 10% growth in adjusted earnings per share for the full year of 2016 based on our expectation that the global economy will gain momentum as we finish out the year. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for Q&A. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, we'd like the callers to limit the questions to one question and one follow-up. Gary, let's go ahead and get started. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Hello, Duffy. Your line is open. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yes. Good morning. I have a question on acetate tow. For the last two years, the industry has talked about inventory destocking, which should have ended by now. And in fact in the first quarter your volumes are up 17%, which you were up only 2% this quarter. So can you talk to us about this destocking? Is there a secular change in buying patterns? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. P.J., I think that destocking has been talked about by a lot of people. And I think that's been pretty well reflected in comments that various producers and consumers have made in the marketplace. So we think that that is kind of running its course. And we don't see a material change in that going forward. In China, we have a view that that material that's exited the Chinese market is out for good, and we really don't see that changing very much going forward, certainly not in the near term anyway. So no, I don't think there's been any real change in the market other than the fact that the capacity outside of China, the western capacity utilization, has gone from effectively 100% to effectively 80%. And we're seeing a lot of activity on the part of buyers to try to stir up the market, and that's resulted in some price declines. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So you would say it's more of a pricing issue rather than volume issue? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the volume piece of it, P.J., was the first part you referred to which was the destocking phenomena as well as the elimination of imported material into China. And that was \u2013 the elimination of imported material was the biggest chunk of that by far. So that has \u2013 no, that's also been part of it, but I think to your point is that's kind of run its course. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then secondly, can you spell out your (7:52) opportunity for GUR? What is it today and where could it be by 2020? Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. GUR is a really interesting product. It has a lot of great characteristics that are into a number of uses. I mean, derivatives of it go into lithium ion battery separators, and that's a pretty hot market for us. There are a lot of industrial applications for GUR as well that continue to grow. We're running our plant pretty hard from a capacity point of view, and there's certainly opportunities we think to expand and grow that business as we move forward in the years ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, P.J. Gary, let's go to the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, David. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, Mark. On acetate tow, in terms of the aggressive activity you referenced, is it one competitor? Is it more than competitor? And why do you think they're doing this now? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's \u2013 perhaps I shouldn't have put those words in. But I'm seeing activity out there that would indicate that people are starting to chase volume. And so if it's people, it's more than one. And the dilemma with that that people get into is that once you start that cycle, it's kind of hard to break it. So I think there are folks out there that have a view that they're more entitled to volume than others, and that's just a dangerous precedent. So I hope we don't get into that, David. And if we do, it's a zero-sum game, so market share can shift around but at the end of the day you don't really \u2013 in a declining market like this, you don't build volume by lowering price. You don't create additional demand in that scenario. So it's kind of a silly thing to do. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And Mark, you referenced potentially down earnings in tow in 2017. Could the segment be \u2013 can you quantify the magnitude of the decline of the consumer segment in 2017 potentially? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think what we have said at prior conferences, the Deutsche Bank conference in particular we made a comment that it could be down 10% to 20% and that \u2013 but it could also be flat. We're kind of sticking with that. I mean, that's a pretty broad range, and I don't mean that in a bad way, David, but we're in the contract season now so it's kind of hard to call it in that process. But I would characterize it as something like that. David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Gary, let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Could I just ask on \u2013 I'm sorry to beat on tow a bit but there's been a lot of capacity curtailments in the past few years and it really seems like the industry was being rational. And I think at a recent conference, Mark, I think I read that you thought that more capacity could come out fairly easily. So I'm just wondering why we're not seeing that. I was kind of thinking we might see some curtailments from somebody in the industry before we got into the 4Q contracting season. Why do you think that's not happening? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, yeah, I don't know. It's a real disappointment to me. If you look at the asset base we have, we think it's the best in the world, and if it's not the best it's right there with the best in the world. The productivity steps we've taken, the multiple shutdowns that we've incurred, we've shut down assets that are, from a production cost point of view, a heck of a lot better than assets that are still in the marketplace today. So it's a bit frustrating to me that others haven't elected to do so. So you'll just have to \u2013 Vince, you'll just have to ask them why they're not doing it. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. We will do that. And then, Chris, could I just ask you, you made some comments in the prepared remarks about Section 385 of the tax code and some concerns you have about it. Could you put that in some type of perspective for what, if any, the impact could be for Celanese maybe in 2017? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I probably won't give you a very satisfying answer because it's such a fluid situation. And what I mean by that is we're talking about a proposed regulation, not a regulation. And the pushback from industry, including both parties in Congress getting involved in the fray, is substantial. So we've heard that there have been over 150,000 comment letters written in response to the proposal, and our understanding is they are required to address every single one of those before they move forward. So it's really hard to say how long that's going to take. And I don't want you to think that I'm hiding from anything here. We can't quantify it until we see what direction it's going. I can tell you what our objective is, and this is what we're working on right now along with every other multinational that I've talked to. Our objective is to find ways irrespective of how this pans out to meet the cash commitments that we've talked about over the course of the next two years, and that's what we're working through. And when I say meet the cash commitments, I mean without some significant detriment to our tax rate. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Understood. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, Vince, I'm going to comment on that. That's a question back from someone last night. This isn't about our income tax structure. It's really about our ability to manage cash and cash generated in Europe. That's really the big issue that most multinationals had with 385. It's not the \u2013 again, it's not the tax structure on earnings. It is the fact that you've actually now earned money, and the classic ways we had of handling that money in Europe and pooling it and things like that are all being challenged by this law, which was put in place ostensibly to reduce the number of inversions that have been occurring. So it's an unintended consequence of the ruling. Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Gary, let's move on to the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Mark, I wanted to talk a little about the AEM business, where your volumes have just been terrific. And I was wondering if you could put in context what you see maybe the market growing in those businesses. I'm trying to isolate your particular product lines and maybe the internal product development process and how that's manifesting in above-market growth rates. And then maybe, as you think into the second half and into next year, I know a lot of investors seem quite cautious and anxious about SAR numbers, auto SARs. I know that's not the only thing you do in AEM. But how do you think about that influence on your go-forward numbers in AEM? Thanks. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Bob. Yeah. What we've developed is a model that \u2013 I mean, it would be wrong to say we're agnostic about materials. But we try to be agnostic about materials. We try to go in and really present all these different platforms and options through our engineers to the engineers at the OEM. We're currently moving six to seven platforms and I would hope that in a not-too-distant future that number grows to almost double that, the number of platforms that we're moving out into the marketplace. So what that's done is it's availed us to a lot of new business opportunities that we didn't get from a classic perspective. So we're seeing markets like industrial and medical really take off in a lot of ways. We're seeing consumer appliances and those kind of product lines \u2013 think of refrigerators, washing machines. We're seeing a lot more interest in designing sophisticated material into their products. So we think the potential of that is best summarized by our statement of product launches. We moved, if you look back in the 2014 timeframe, from 300 to 1,000; we'll be at 1,200 this year. I expect we'll be pushing 1,500 next year and 2,000 the year after that. That's the kind of growth rate that we believe, and you've seen the benefit of going effectively from 300 to 1,000 and then 1,000 to 1,200. You're seeing that in our volume. So I think that's what should continue as we go out there. Auto sales, I mean I saw the numbers the other day of 91 million units for the year; I think up about 2.9% to 3% is the current forecast. Pretty flat in the U.S., Bob, to your point. Europe is up pretty strong. And of course places like Latin America or South America, I should say, are down double digits. So we think that maybe it is kind of peaking in the 90 million unit kind of range, but again our objective is substitution. We think there's a lot more opportunities for the substitution business to go. So auto is important for us, but it's getting less important every day. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : One example to that, Bob, so we sort of track this by various sectors and you heard Mark talk about consumer, where we're going after some really great opportunities. So those volumes, if you do second quarter versus prior year, are up over 20%, and that's kind of how it's tracking this year. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thanks, guys. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Gary, let's go to the next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Frank. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, Mark. If I listen \u2013 if I read between the lines, it doesn't sound \u2013 on the acetate tow side, it doesn't sound like Celanese is contemplating shuttering any assets to get that capacity utilization number up over that 80% level. I presume that's correct? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We think we've done our fair share. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Terrific. And you also referenced volumes being a bit better in Q2 due to unusual purchasing patterns in Europe. What exactly was that? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, classically volumes are up a bit in the first quarter. We had some contractual activity that gave us the opportunity to move some more volume. And I don't want to get into the specifics of that, but there were some opportunistic events that occurred that gave us a chance just to move incremental volume. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Terrific. And then you mentioned obviously a $0.20 negative impact from turnarounds in Q2. Can you split that between the AEM and AI side of things and... Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It's one-third AI, two-thirds materials. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Terrific. Then lastly, you mentioned that you expect the global economy to improve in the back half of the year. Here we are three, four weeks into Q3. Are you seeing signs that give you more confidence that you will see that reacceleration? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the real signs of the misery index continues to go up, and that can only last so long. But we are seeing \u2013 we do think that in China \u2013 if you look at China, some of the activity that is underway right now this very minute is kind of a response we think to ongoing and continued pressure for a reduction in capacity utilization in China, so I expect that that's going to start to happen this fall. It's my personal belief. I also think that the relatively tight band on methanol that we've seen in China between the cost to produce and the MTO value is going to start expanding. And you're going to see more and more methanol move into MTO, and I think that's going to shore up that business and start pushing that higher. And really that's what we need. At the end of the day, we need in terms of AI, we need China to stabilize. We need them to start taking actions, to start shutting some capacity, and we need methanol to start easing up. So there's signs that that could be happening. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Terrific. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks. Gary, let's go to the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. In looking at your AEM pricing, I think in the first quarter it was down 2%, and in the second quarter it was down 4%. Is there a trend there? Is down 4% where we are for the second half or is there further slippage? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think the \u2013 we talked about that in the last two calls in directionally, Jeff. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a greater split between high-end product values and low-end product values. So the low-end materials, which represent still a big chunk of volume for us, are decreasing in price as there's more and more competition than some of those big-volume products. Yeah. There's not a lot of ongoing activity in price in that, so I think I want to say it's run its course and the guys haven't told me to expect a lot more with that. But I'm kind of looking around the room. I think that's \u2013 I'm getting head nods here, so I think where we are is kind of where we are going to be for a while. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then in the quarter, your SG&A costs were $71 million, I guess, versus $80 million in the first quarter. What caused that change? Is that the right level for the remainder of the year? And can you also speak on the change in your pension liabilities because of changes in interest rates? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So the SG&A has continued to trend down because of the productivity initiatives that we've got. I don't have the split between SG&A and your fixed costs and manufacturing, but we're on track with what we talked about being around $100 million of productivity year-over-year. Pensions, are you referring to the forward view on what we have? Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, in other words, interest rates have really come down. And I think in your prepared remarks you talk about how it's difficult to forecast GAAP earnings for the year. Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. Well, we're referring to the fact that we use mark-to-market pension accounting, which some companies don't. So in the fourth quarter, you always have a gain or a loss associated with those interest rate movements. So yeah, if interest rates go lower during the year, then we'll have a bigger pension liability and a bigger loss. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Gary, let's move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Can you speak up, please? Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I'm sorry. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. I was just wondering what are the near-term catalysts for acetic and VAM that could improve pricing for the rest of this year? It looks like there's kind of limited outages in North America for the rest of the year. Is this primarily related to methanol or what else needs to happen here? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think there's not much \u2013 there doesn't seem to be much volatility in that market today. So I don't see a lot of activity to improve pricing on the near term, near term being this quarter, out there. On a fundamental sense, a lot of the reduction, the mathematical reduction that's occurred in VAM has been methanol-driven. So what you need to see is you need to see methanol starting to shore up and starting to drift higher is one mechanism for that. I can't comment on outages or anything \u2013 you never see those in the horizon, but this is an industry that has, unlike Celanese, has had a lot of trouble running for very long periods of time. So I'm sure there will be some outages, I just don't know where they'll be. But fundamentally, to get price up methanol is going to start easing back up a bit. Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just as a follow-up for methanol, is it still safe to think of that MTO as kind of the price setter going forward? And then how should we think about \u2013 there's still a large wave of capacity coming on 2017. How could that impact prices over kind of the medium term? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. What you are seeing with MTO is you're seeing the introduction of really world-scale, world-class assets. And those assets are going to run and they have a much lower average operating cost than some of the smaller assets which are the early ones to come on. So we believe that as these big units come online, we think they're going to suck up methanol and we think they're going to be very competitive against other ethylene producers within China. And so that's sort of our story and our belief system. And that should be happening as we enter 2017, it should start to happen. So we think, as we go through 2017, it's going to continue to grow and we think methanol is going to follow that as that consumption picks up. Regarding acid, yeah, I'm not really sure what you're talking about from additional capacity coming on. Acid is way long today in China. And I think it's academic whether it's another future kt that's going in on this. It's just \u2013 it's very long. Daniel DiCicco - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. Gary, let's go to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. On the cellulose acetate resin lines that feed the fiber lines, can the resin lines be repurposed to engineered polymer, or is the demand for those types of polymers so small that that wouldn't be an option? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We sell some of that, but the demand generically is pretty low for those products. So we continue to look for ways to promote that and push it, but it's \u2013 you're talking a few percentage of the volume of cellulose resin that goes into the polymers. It's a small percentage of the industry that goes that way. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, John. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Gary, let's go to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. Mark, I remember a couple of years ago you had some issues with methanol supply and it created a big headwind for your business. And you guys really worked hard and defied expectations offsetting the impact of that. Can you talk about strategically what you're thinking about as ways to mitigate any impacts from the filter tow in 2017? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think \u2013 I mean, that was a great example, going back to methanol. Methanol was a multi-hundred million dollar impact to us. And at the time we were pretty creative in how we brought in a new project to offset the vast, vast majority of that, probably all but $30 million to $40 million of the inventory offset. Yeah. On cellulosics, I think the \u2013 let me just start by saying that when you look at the base data, this is a declining business, but it's not declining at any materially different rate than it had been declining at. And the big issue that we've had in that business has been the step changes that occurred in China, which pushed out effectively 100 kt \u2013 100,000 tons into the western market, which effectively reduced our capacity utilization by 20%. So if you look at it as a one-time event, bam, that's done, and it's not going to be replicated. So there's no way that (27:50) is going to pick up to the extent they'll replace 20% of the volume in the western world. So what we see is necessary there for the industry to restructure over time to minimize the industry's cost over time to service the customers that the industry has out there. And that's good for everybody. That's going to occur, Jim. It's just going to take a while for that to occur. So when you go beyond that, is there some magic bullet to do something with cellulosics? It's not easy to see that. We're working on some schemes to increase volume there. I'm sure others are as well. I'm sure we'll be somewhat successful with that, but it won't be the same value equation as tow or the same quantity material as tow. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And on the tax code, potential impacts from that proposed change, I think you referenced some workarounds that you might have. Could you describe what kind of workarounds that you're thinking about? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, as Mark mentioned, this is really kind of about cash management and how you move cash around your company. And some things that were written in that proposal make the typical transactions that you use a little more challenging. What we think is there are going to be certain provisions for how you avail yourself of current-year earnings around the world and that those can pass through more easily than sort of prior-year earnings. So that's really kind of what we're working on is are there ways to still effectively move your money around. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jim, on the first question, so I answered that first question of yours referenced to cellulosics in particular. When you look beyond cellulosics from a corporate point of view, I'll mention two things. One is that you're seeing examples in materials of the strength of the growth of that model. We don't think that that's anywhere close to being fully realized, and we're investing a lot of energy and effort to effectively double from 1,000 to 2,000, effectively double the new product launches and projects that we have ongoing per year into that marketplace. There's tremendous value associated with that, tremendous value. Our M&A effort remains very active and strong. And where you've seen small things like CoolPoly, we have bigger things on the horizon that we're working to bring home. And hopefully we'll bring those home. That would take us, if we can do that, from six platforms in materials to multiples of that, so call it 10 or 12 platforms in the marketplace. So that should give us a chance and even further grow and further expand and push. In the Acetyl Chain, we think that there are opportunities for that industry to consolidate, that industry to be more cooperative in terms of who's producing what products for the marketplace and one another. And so we think that those activities, we'll be in front of those, and we're working those very hard. And lastly, there's productivity. And this year, as Chris mentioned, we're going to roll out some net $100 million, and we'll keep working that next year. And it's too early to put forth a number for next year but we've been doing that for a number of years. And you should expect that you'll see a pretty healthy expectation for us on productivity as we continue to go forward. James M. Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Appreciate the color, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks, Jim. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Let's go to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. In AEM, your volumes grew 8% in the second quarter. Can you sustain this level of growth into the second half? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We think so. I mean naturally you have less growth and \u2013 I don't know if you've been, Aleksey, over to Europe anytime soon, I was over there last week and everybody is already on vacation. So August is kind of a non-event. So there's a natural fall-off a bit for us in the third quarter, but directionally, yes, we think we can sustain that. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. And then I think you've provided us with some elements to kind of bridge your 2017 segment income. So you spoke about advancing your materials. What about Acetyl's side of the equation? Do you think you can show growth next year? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's hard to see the activity in China and not be able to view that it's short term. I mean, it's so messy and so bloody and \u2013 so, yeah, I believe that business will grow next year in spite of the fact that it's dealing with \u2013 has been dealing this year through some toughness and will continue to deal with some toughness for another quarter or so. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: And a final question, if I may. Is consolidation in acetate tow possible in your opinion, from an anti-trust perspective, from any other considerations? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's challenging. It's challenging because \u2013 well, it's just challenging. It depends on who it is and where it is is what I would say. But any trust today no matter what you're doing is challenging. So not easy. Aleksey Yefremov - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Aleksey. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, let's go the next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe in the third quarter you'll start to anniversary the methanol contract and, of course, you're on natural gas in the U.S., and then some coal-based and oil-based in Asia. Would you refresh us on how your different acetic acid assets look in terms of the global cost curve today? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, of course, the U.S. remains the low-cost spot of the world, followed now by Singapore, which has coal derivative \u2013 I mean, the oil derivative feedstock and the gasification there, followed by Chinese coal. So we are running the Singaporean asset harder. It's satisfying a lot of the demand outside of China with that asset. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. And then just in terms of the tow pricing in the second quarter, would you be able to tease out how much of that was driven by raw materials versus meeting competitive pressures in the market? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Well, we don't really price that product off of raw materials. I mean, it's pretty disconnected from that. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : But presumably with raw materials came down, generally the annual contracts do follow to a certain degree? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. No. There's no relationship there, at least not that I'm aware of in that. And pricing this year is a function of the contract last year, the year after that. So there's a lag in that process. So the pricing step-down that you saw is the stuff we were talking about last year that was happening as the early tranches of volume came out of China. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. Understood. And if I could squeeze in a last one, would you be able to quantify how your cash balances are geographically, where you hold most of your cash? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Most of it is overseas. We do have some in the U.S. right now. I think it's around $200 million. We finished the year last year with virtually none in the U.S., and since then we've moved some back. And as you know we've had great strong cash flows and it's enabled us to return about $300 million to shareholders so far this year. Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Gary, we'll take one more question with one follow-up. Operator : The final question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Good morning, Mark. Mark, I wanted you to revisit the turnaround sort of guidance that you had given in Q1. If I remember correctly, you talked about $0.30 to $0.35 worth for sequential headwind. So my question is did it turn out to be $0.30 to $0.35? Was it higher or was it lower? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm going to let Chris answer that. Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So when we said $0.30 to $0.35, there was another thing in there in addition to the turnarounds, which we talked about some overlapping VAM contracts that were a benefit in Q1 that wouldn't be there in Q2. So the $0.30 to $0.35 was really those things together. And together they're in that range. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Right. Fair enough. And again, sticking to the whole sort of turnaround side of things, in the AI business sequentially volumes were down 11%. So if I were to sort of assume that there were no turnarounds, what would that sort of volume figure look like? Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I don't think we lost volume because we planned production to manage our way through these turnarounds. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. So it was just purely sort of demand weakness Q1 to Q2 that resulted in that 11% decline. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Yeah. If you look at it, most of that is really just China. And there's no point in chasing incremental volume when it's in the ditch like that. It doesn't really contribute material to your business. So no, you saw us bring \u2013 pull blinds back as did many in China and just not chase the bottom of that market. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Very sense. And one final one, if I may. The sort of Q1 guidance for (37:57) was a $0.10 headwind. Clearly, a bunch of moving parts with regards to methanol and MTB and the like. But you still think that that headwind should be in the same range for 2016? Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think that business will be down $40 million or something for the year. So... Christopher W. Jensen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : $40 million to $50 million. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : $40 million to $50 million, so you'll save $0.25 of earnings from that alone. Hassan I. Ahmed - Alembic Global Advisors LLC : Got it. Got it. Very helpful. Thanks so much, Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. We will wrap things up here. Thanks, everybody, for your time. And we'll be around for questions later today. Gary, at this point I'll turn it back over to you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Kyrish. Please go ahead. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Gary. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Sutton, Executive Vice President and President of Materials Solutions. Celanese Corporation's third quarter 2016 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our Web site, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our Web site in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then we'll field your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark C. Rohr: Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared remarks were released with earnings last night, so I'll keep these opening comments brief and open the line for your questions. Before I discuss our quarterly results, I\u2019d like to talk about an exciting announcement last night, an agreement to purchase SO.F.TER. Group based in Forli, Italy; one of the world\u2019s largest independent thermoplastic compounders with operations in Italy, Mexico, Brazil and the United States. SO.F.TER. and Celanese are a great fit given our similar design capabilities, excellent technology and a shared focus on developing customer-oriented solutions. This combination will nearly double the number of engineered material platforms available to Celanese and will open new markets to expand upon. The deal will be immediately accretive adding roughly $0.10 to our adjusted earnings per share in 2017 and we expect to increase that $0.10 by two to three times over the coming years. This is a natural and thoughtful step forward in evolution of our engineered materials business, and we\u2019re extremely excited to begin working with the talented men and women at SO.F.TER. to drive value for our customers. Scott Sutton who runs our materials core is here with me this morning to provide additional color and answer your questions about this exciting deal. Shifting to our consolidated results, we generated a record third quarter performance in both GAAP diluted earnings of $1.83 per share as well as adjusted earnings of $1.67 per share. We grew segment income by 4.6% year-over-year and expanded our margin by 250 basis points to 24.1%, our highest ever third quarter performance. These results were driven by record earnings and profitability in advanced engineered materials and resilient performance in our globally integrated Acetyl Chain. We successfully launched 351 new projects in engineered materials in the quarter and remain on pace to meet our goal of 1,200 new project launches in 2016. We continued our pace of cash generation with 237 million of free cash flow and we returned 152 million of cash to our shareholders in the quarter. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the success we have had over the first three quarters of the year and we\u2019re confident in our ability to drive value of our businesses, generate productivity gains and to continue to build momentum in new project launches. As such, we are maintaining our expectation to grow adjusted earnings per share by 8% to 10% for the full year of 2016. As we begin to look to 2017, we will continue to expand and grow our engineered materials pipeline and leverage our low cost integrated global network in the Acetyl Chain to best manage the current operating environment we\u2019re in. We have set our sights on at least 1,500 new project launches in the engineered materials space based on the success we\u2019ve had to-date and the capabilities added through the announced acquisition of SO.F.TER. We\u2019ve identified incremental productivity opportunities for 2017 targeting additional $100 million of benefit for the year and rolling it altogether in net of the $0.30 to $0.40 of headwinds in the tow previously discussed, we expect to grow our adjusted earnings per share by roughly $0.60 to $0.70 in 2017 versus 2016. We will refine this initial look as our planning process wraps during the fourth quarter this year and update you with a more informed view in January. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck for Q&A. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, we'd like the callers to limit questions to one question and one follow-up. Gary, let's go ahead and get started. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Duffy Fisher with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fisher : Good morning fellows. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fisher : A question around materials solutions, very nice volume gain, price lower; can you tease out in those numbers how much of that was your new push kind of into non-manufactured molecules in AEM where you\u2019re sourcing those other areas and maybe talk about if you just look at your own business year-over-year, how might those numbers have looked different if you wouldn\u2019t have taken that strategy? Mark C. Rohr: Scott, do you want to -- Scott Sutton : Yes, sure. Hi, Duffy. If you look at all of our business, of course we add the innovation and technology through compounding to all of it, but most of our platforms today we also manufacture the polymer as well. So really \u2013 all of that is ours and all of that comes through the pipeline. You referenced price and a lot of that, that smaller degradation you see is really driven by outsized volume growth in Asia related to the other regions. Duffy Fisher : Okay, so that was mostly a mix shift to Asia more so than a mix shift to different types of polymers that you\u2019re sourcing from new sources basically? Scott Sutton : We grew volumes in every single region, it\u2019s just that Asia has been the source of our highest growth over the last couple of quarters. Duffy Fisher : Okay. And then a question on the cash flow, you\u2019ve guided to better than 850 this year but keeping the 2.5 billion over the next three years, if you just look at the run rate if cash flow basically tracks at the same percentage of earnings and earnings grow the next couple of years, that 2.5 should be higher. Is there a reason that cash flow would basically diverge from earnings over the next couple of years and trend lower or no? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, we\u2019ll talk more about it when we come out with more complete guidance but Duffy, I think that it will not keep the same pace '16 to '17 that earnings will. And the reason for that is we had a lot of capital expenditure with that methanol plant and there is some bonus depreciation provisions in the tax code that allowed us to accelerate tax deductions on a cash tax basis. So on a cash tax basis, we probably will have higher cash taxes in 2017. Out of the shoot I would probably say, earnings will grow but free cash flow would be flattish in '17, then grow again in '18, still on track for 2.5 billion. Duffy Fisher : Great. Thank you, guys. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Duffy. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Duffy. Gary, let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Matthew Andrejkovics : Good morning. This is Matt Andrejkovics on for Vincent. I was hoping if you could clarify the $0.30 to $0.40 headwind in 2017 tow and how it translates to pricing and volume forecast? Mark C. Rohr: You said Matt? Matthew Andrejkovics : Yes. Mark C. Rohr: Okay, Matt, this is Mark. I think we said in the past that it\u2019s about 50-50 price and volume. And we\u2019re still in a process of wrapping that up, so that\u2019s still the most contemporary data we have. Matthew Andrejkovics : Okay, great. And then I was also curious if you could clarify how the VAM margin contraction flows through the various segments and how you\u2019ve mitigated some of the weakness there so far? Chris Jensen : Yes, I\u2019m not sure I really can answer that. What I\u2019ll say is that VAM has been weak as we came off of the coatings \u2013 the coating season started to slow down but we\u2019re already starting to see some tightening in that business as we enter the fourth quarter and have some good expectations of a stronger market next year. Matthew Andrejkovics : Great. Thanks, guys. Chris Jensen : Thanks, Matt. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Matt. Gary, let\u2019s move to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo : Good morning. This is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. Can you just give just some color on regional sales trends particularly with automotive in the U.S. and Europe in September, just what you\u2019re seeing if there\u2019s anything to pull down or how are things just fairing up? Mark C. Rohr: I\u2019ll comment on auto, then maybe let Scott comment just on the overall trends if that\u2019s okay, Dan. Everybody has access for the data and if you look at the trends, the year-over-year trends we\u2019ve had pretty flat in the U.S. I think we\u2019re up a tenth of a percent or so and in Europe maybe 4% increase and in Asia maybe 4% as well increase if you look at from a year-over-year point of view. From a trend point of view looking forward, I think the consensus view is that again U.S. is going to stay pretty flat, growing a little bit. Expectation of slowing in Europe, I think they\u2019re forecasting next year 1.3% growth versus a stronger growth, about 4% this year. But again, we are so \u2013 we\u2019re in so many markets there. I don\u2019t want you guys to overreact \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t overreact. We don\u2019t overreact all that moving around because I will roll in, in this business, this is a very solid product. So we\u2019re not dependent on growth of new car builds per se to really drive value here. Scott, do you want to comment about regional growth trends in other areas? Scott Sutton : Yes, I would just add in engineered materials in the third quarter, we grew the volumes roughly 12%. But if you look at by region, Asia is above 20%; Europe\u2019s running along that same 12% pace and Americas is a bit below that. But I would say our growth in auto segment was actually a bit less than our growth in other segments. Dan Rizzo : Okay. But it would seem that \u2013 given the strength in those numbers picking in AEM, that\u2019s more of a function of you guys taking share and then introducing new products versus the overall trend for the end markets, correct? Scott Sutton : I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s so much about taking share, right, unless you think of it as coming up with a new solution to replace other out of time materials. It\u2019s really about closing projects and gaining business through technology and solutions. Dan Rizzo : Okay, that\u2019s what I was kind of referring to. Thank you, guys. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Dan. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. Gary, let\u2019s move to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, gentlemen, and congrats on a nice quarter. Mark, if I could try and get a better sense as to how the quarter progressed, my sense is that the start to the quarter might not have been as robust as you guys were ultimately able to achieve. Can you talk a little bit about the pace of business throughout the quarter and then as we enter into Q4 here? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, we started the quarter with a view of a little bit more flatness. I think we had talked about that with you guys there. So as we got into the quarter, there was a lot of energy and effort primarily in materials to just really be successful. And so we worked really hard with our projects, we worked really hard in our pipeline, we worked really hard with our customers. Had a few successes more than we had planned and that\u2019s what really drove the value question. I think likewise we have been a bit concerned that the chain business could slide more and they did a phenomenal job making sure that they kept it in check given the slowdown that we anticipated in third quarter in China. So it\u2019s really a material story I think incrementally through the quarter. Frank Mitsch : All right and that continued into October, the better than expected business trends, is that correct? Mark C. Rohr: Yes. Frank Mitsch : All right, great. And then lastly, you\u2019re 30% through on your $1 billion share buyback over '16 and '17. Does the softer acquisition change the calculus there or are you still committed to buying back 1 billion before the end of '17? Mark C. Rohr: No, it doesn\u2019t change the calculus. We\u2019re still committed to that. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Mark C. Rohr: Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Frank. Gary, let\u2019s move to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Hi. Good morning, Mark. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, P.J. How are you? P.J. Juvekar: Good. You described the micro deflationary in your comments and your overall year-over-year pricing was down 9% and a big part of that was Acetyl but AEM was also down 4%. Now that all these parties are stabilized, what\u2019s preventing you from getting pricing or is price increases not sticking? Mark C. Rohr: I think my comment \u2013 plus you have changed that comment. I think we have been in a deflationary environment and P.J. you and I have talked about that on a couple of occasions. There are trends that would say that that\u2019s \u2013 I won\u2019t say ending but it certainly has bounced on the bottom and it\u2019s trending back up, everything from the movements we have seen recently in oil, if you look at the movements in coal which have been quite dramatic in China. We\u2019re seeing some movements in methanol. Of course, ethylene is strong. So I think we\u2019re moving back to some inflation. And to answer your question, is there a reason we can\u2019t go get that, the answer is no. We look hard to make sure we can find ways to go extract incremental value and we don\u2019t like eating raw material inflation. But what I will say is that there\u2019s been a bit of a \u2013 these things happen very quickly, so sometimes you get stuck for a month or two. But generally speaking I think it bodes well for the establishment of a floor to the deflation that we\u2019ve seen in the world and hopefully some growth is going to start to now occur. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, thank you. And then on your SO.F.TER. acquisition, how do SO.F.TER. margins compare to yours? And can you give us some ballpark idea of what kind of multiple was paid given the cheap financing? Thank you. Mark C. Rohr: I\u2019ll let Scott talk about margins. Scott Sutton : Yes. Hi, P.J. I would say with regard to the margins, they are lower than our base business right now but there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for synergy there, P.J. We still have to close this. We\u2019ll get it closed in December, so we\u2019re really not disclosing the price. But just to give you a feel for the size of it, it\u2019s roughly $300 million a year in revenue. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, P.J. Gary, let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, David. David Begleiter : Mark, you announced some price increases in Sea gas [ph] the last week in China. Can you talk about right now what\u2019s happening in China from an acid perspective and how you see those market conditions progressing through into next year? Mark C. Rohr: Well, I think right now at this moment, the trends in China are good. We\u2019ve seen some traction on pricing in there driven by I think David the residual effects of the inflation in coal and in methanol. Capacity utilization rates are still quite low in China but we\u2019re seeing some evidence of apparent tightening in the marketplace. So I think the trends are good with that. We also have by our math maybe 3 million tons of methanol consumption coming into that market through MTO expansions as we enter next year, so kind of like the first half of the year which is also going to bode well for keeping the pressure on methanol and hopefully getting some more inflation there. So I think \u2013 what I\u2019ll just say to you is that we\u2019re encouraged by what we see but it is at the end of the day movements in what is a market that is still pretty sloppy. So we will take it day by day here and give you guys a better update in January. David Begleiter : Very good. And Mark just on the M&A pipeline, how is the pipeline now ex-SO.F.TER. Are there SO.F.TER. opportunities out there going forward? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, sir. We hope to make this habit of routinely announcing new deals. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks a lot, David. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, David. Gary, let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, Bob. Bob Koort : Mark, can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 I know you mentioned coal prices are up, certainly up more than that methanol is up. You guys do better in that environment because you can produce out of Singapore or how do you flex your plans and how do you optimize that given you\u2019re buying coal-based and methanol-based inputs in China? Mark C. Rohr: Well, if you look at it today there\u2019s probably order of magnitude if you look at coal prices today in China, there\u2019s anywhere between $50 and $100 a ton depending on how you do the math, advantage of being in Singapore on oil base versus the coal base in China. And of course when oil gets back at $100 range, that situation reverses, Bob. So right now it\u2019s our advantage that we\u2019re running very, very hard in Singapore and moving that material mostly outside of China. We can also move into China as well and compete in regions or areas of China we don\u2019t normally compete in. Bob Koort : Got it, thank you. And then on filter tow, can you give us some characterization of how you see the market in and outside of China, maybe some comments around pricing or operating rates? I know you talk about resetting annual contracts and your competitors have talked about multiyear contracts. Can we speak to any developments there? Thanks. Mark C. Rohr: I\u2019ll let Scott \u2013 Scott, do you want to give it a shot? Scott Sutton : Yes, sure. Yes, thanks. Overall, if you think about outside of China, industry utilization is roughly around 80%, we\u2019ve said that before and it\u2019s sort of sticking there. But when you take a look at China, the assets that are on the ground in China run full out all the time. What has changed is the imports going into China and we don\u2019t see that dropping imports changing over the next couple of years. Bob Koort : Great. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Bob. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Bob. Gary, let\u2019s move to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi. Good morning, Mark. In your AEM business, I think your revenues were flat sequentially but your volume was up 16% year-over-year. I think maybe it was 8% in the second quarter. Why is it that there was so little revenue change sequentially? Were volumes up sequentially or were they flat, how do they compare? Scott Sutton : Yes, sure. Okay, yes, thanks. This is Scott. And what I\u2019ll say is sequentially, Q3 is just not quite as big a volume quarter for us traditionally. So you see some slight drop in volumes sequentially. But what\u2019s interesting this year of course the volume drop is not as much as it\u2019s been in the past. Certainly just like you said, year-on-year volumes are up quite a bit and that\u2019s the perfect comparison to do, because it\u2019s the demonstration of the pipeline. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. And then for my follow up, is SO.F.TER. a competitor of yours or who are SO.F.TER.\u2019s key competition? And is the benefits that you expect to get from the acquisition more cost reduction or is it from a faster rate of growth or if you had to balance those two factors, how do you see it? Scott Sutton : What I would say about SO.F.TER., they\u2019re not a competitor of ours. This is very complementary. If you think about Celanese, we have nine different polymer platforms that we operate out of. SO.F.TER. adds eight more to us. So we go from 9 to 17. What\u2019s interesting is about three of their platforms are in engineered thermoplastics which we are too but six are actually in the soft stuff, elastomers or TPEs and I think there will be very good integration of customers and channels as well as we get those additional selling opportunities. So following on that, the main uplift are synergies. A lot of it is going to be more solutions, better business, bigger positions with customers. There\u2019s also going to be quite a number of manufacturing and supply chain enhancements too, so you get the lift from both cost synergies as well as revenue synergies. Jeff Zekauskas : And who are their key competitors? Scott Sutton : Well, I guess there\u2019s a number but if you look at other people that are in elastomers, that\u2019s really your best view of who might see SO.F.TER. as a competitor. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Jeff. Gary, let\u2019s go to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, Mark. Is your view that you expressed on the filter tow business for 2017 really any different today than what you\u2019ve communicated previously? Mark C. Rohr: No, it\u2019s still within that range and that\u2019s as good as we can call it today, Jim. I don\u2019t see it being better than $0.30 down. I don\u2019t see it worse than $0.40 down. So it\u2019s somewhere in that range. Jim Sheehan : Great. And then Acetyl Intermediates, can you elaborate more on what you mean by commercial strategies benefitting you in 2017? How much of that is sort of better supply-demand in the market and how much of that is sort of strategies that you\u2019re bringing to bear? Mark C. Rohr: Well, I think the strategic way we work that business has not changed, Jim. We\u2019re very active and very aggressive and really making sure we understand the market, understand the windows of opportunity to move materials around and we\u2019ve found ways to take advantage of that given our global mix in both production and distribution logistics. What I\u2019m trying to say in there is I think we\u2019re seeing affirmation of the bottom and upside in that business and there\u2019s a subside what we always see is more opportunities from this because of that. And you ought to see incrementally more margin appearing in the products which gives you more ability to benefit from the steps you take. So, we think the platform is strengthening but I\u2019m a little cautious in how much to boast about that right now because the market is really in a tremendously \u2013 situation that\u2019s tremendous over capacity and we\u2019ve not had a lot of weeks or even months of good performance yet. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Jim. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Hi, guys. Nice quarter, almost as nice as the [indiscernible]. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Mike. Michael Sison : You\u2019re welcome. But just curious in terms of AEM, you\u2019re on track to generate 200 to 300 new launches this year and then you talked about another 200 to 300 for next year. EBIT went up 60 million to 70 million in '16. So, is that a good rule of thumb for what the launches produced in terms of EBIT as we head into '17? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, I think we\u2019re all shaking our head yes. I think that\u2019s pretty reasonable. Michael Sison : And does the '17 outlook include SO.F.TER. in terms of launch? Mark C. Rohr: In theory it does. Michael Sison : Okay. And then last question, in terms of how you\u2019re going to get this business to be two to three times better, is it just simply moving them into this new product launch process and just driving revenue in that business? Mark C. Rohr: It\u2019s mostly revenue. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not looking at this as having tremendous synergy effects but we do think there\u2019s going to be tremendous impact in our ability to work together. These are great men and women in SO.F.TER. and they do a phenomenal job well, well respected by the customers like we feel we are, and we\u2019ve already had a number of complimentary kind of calls of folks that are, one, glad we\u2019re doing the deal and glad to have more opportunities to work with us. So it\u2019s really all about growth and commercial performance. Michael Sison : Great. Thanks. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Mike. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Mike. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC. Please go ahead. Daniel DiCicco : Hi. This is Dan DiCicco on for Arun. Thank you for taking my question. Mark C. Rohr: Dan, how are you? Daniel DiCicco : Good. As has been mentioned, we\u2019ve seen spot methanol, acetic, VAM all take up to begin the quarter. Can you talk about how this could impact margins just along the chain in the quarter? And then is there kind of any lag effect that we should be thinking about? Mark C. Rohr: Well, there\u2019s always a little bit of lag effect but margins have been so low that it\u2019s a pretty modest impact right now. We need to see \u2013 to be honest, we need to see more of it sticking and we probably need the next round of increases really to start to see material impact. I think this is a 2017 story versus a 2016 story, Dan. Daniel DiCicco : Okay, thanks. And then as a follow up, you guys provided expectations of $0.35 to $0.45 of EPS from new product launches in 2017. Do you guys have a similar number for 2016 in terms of the new products? Chris Jensen : Dan, I would answer the same way. You see the projected growth from '15 to '16 and all that was really predicated on the new project launches that we had. And we grew in '16 almost 300 projects over '15, so you get the same kind of cycle going. Daniel DiCicco : Okay, great. Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Dan. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Just to confirm, the $0.35 to $0.45 growth in AEM that you expect next year, does that include the $0.10 contribution from SO.F.TER. acquisition? Mark C. Rohr: Aleksey, we\u2019re saying yes but you have to understand this is a very early spin on that, so I wouldn\u2019t read \u2013 I like us to be within $0.10 of being totally accurate on all these numbers. But right now we\u2019re saying yes. Aleksey Yefremov : Okay, great. Thank you. And your press release mentions that you have some new products within orthopedic devices. Can this potentially be a much bigger business and what types of devices or implants are you involved in right now? Mark C. Rohr: That\u2019s a prior press release. Scott Sutton : Aleksey that\u2019s probably from a prior press release but of course we\u2019re involved in a couple things; knee implants, hip implants, these kind of things. We\u2019re also involved in drug delivery devices where our materials are actually the excipient. We do have some new development in the drug delivery area. Most of our medical development is actually in devices that are outside of the body, and we have quite a number of projects in our pipeline for that. Aleksey Yefremov : Great. Thank you very much. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Back to the SO.F.TER. competition question, are most of the competitors back integrated into resin production or polymer production as well or is SO.F.TER. competition primarily compounders and not integrated like SO.F.TER.? Scott Sutton : John, this is Scott. I would say that you have both. You have some primary players that are back integrated into let\u2019s call it one or the other polymers, right, but you still have quite a number of independents that are involved in adding the technology through compounding and through solutions with the customers. John Roberts : Okay. And then -- Mark C. Rohr: John, let me just add a comment on that. What we have found in this business is there is pure and unique polymer technology in some areas and there\u2019s pure and unique compounded technology in some areas. And in both cases they\u2019re sort of generic material. So we\u2019re all about that technology. So when we look at a group like SO.F.TER. and work with them, they bring a lot of unique and not easily reproducible technology through their compounding process, like we do. And so we don\u2019t at all look at that as being a disadvantage of not being back integrated. In fact, it\u2019s a real advantage because you can really go out and buy different materials and really play a pretty strong game in raw material base. John Roberts : And then on Slide 4 where you have Step 6; next project system step-up, is there an easy way for you to just remind me what that encapsulates? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, sure, John. As we add more and more here, we\u2019re driving to an outcome where we\u2019re able to launch 2,000 projects a year instead of the 1,300 that we\u2019re at now. And so it just involves adding capabilities to our unique model and our unique pipeline system where we\u2019re able to represent the broadest platform in the industry to customers and we\u2019re also able to juggle the 6,000 projects at the same time that it takes to launch 2,000. So that is really just enhancing our model. You see it as Step 6 on this slide. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Mark C. Rohr: Good morning, Hassan. Hassan Ahmed : Just wanted to chat a bit about the AI guidance you had given for 2017. You talked about $0.25 to $0.35 of year-over-year increment in '17. Just trying to get a sense with all the moving parts; coal prices rising, methanol prices rising and the like, what sort of a methanol pricing environment are you baking in this $0.25 to $0.35 increment? And associated with that just purely directionally, are you talking about further increments in methanol pricing and then you being able to pass those along and then some? Just trying to get a sense of direction. Mark C. Rohr: What we do this time of year, so we go through a process of really range funding on what we think the value of our machine can deliver through the next year. So you need to appreciate these are pretty superficial numbers. We\u2019ve not taken credit for any kind of extraordinary enhancement in methanol pricing and margin. It could in theory roll through the chain if that happens. What I will say is that the trends are encouraging with that regard. But there\u2019s not baked into these numbers a miraculous recovery in margins out there. It\u2019s what we will deliver kind of with things the way they are. Hassan Ahmed : Okay, fair enough. And as a follow up, obviously much said about the tow business. You\u2019re taking about continued weakness in '17. As I look at it, it\u2019s obviously a relatively consolidated business, right. But are there opportunities out there? Are people in the industry talking about further consolidation if possible at all? And if that is the case, would you guys consider yourselves consolidated or would you \u2013 if the environment continues to remain sloppy, would you guys potentially consider even divesting that business? Mark C. Rohr: Let\u2019s start at the top. I think the business has historically been well managed by the players that are in the business and they\u2019ve been very thoughtful, and I think they will continue to be thoughtful as we go forward. The offsets occur because of the reduction of imported material going into China, which we\u2019ve talked at length about. And we\u2019ve been very clear, as usual, the first ones to talk about that stuff. So we\u2019ve laid that out pretty well, so you get off from a 100% as Scott said to roughly 80%. So the choppiness you\u2019re seeing now is really that. It\u2019s more that than fundamental decline in cigarette consumption. In fact, we saw some data the other day that would indicate through all this mess and struggles within China that they\u2019ve gone from 2.5 trillion or 2.6 trillion, let\u2019s say, sticks down to 2.4 trillion to 2.5 trillion, so a 6% to 7% kind of reduction in volume. So there\u2019s been a disproportion of the impact of this. So I think the fundamentals of the business are still very good. What I\u2019ll also say is the industry has independently done a lot to rationalize capacity. This was a business that was in the fibers business. So you think definitely larger capacity in terms of unit operations and what we have in place today. So my belief is the industry will continue to be good stewards and my belief is this very easy to understand sequence that we\u2019re going through will work its way through the system in the years to come out there. Will the industry have opportunities to consolidate further? Yes, perhaps. Solvay is rumored to be selling their business, I don\u2019t know the status of that, but you guys can call them and see if that\u2019s true or not. So I think there are other people who do look for whether they should have other options that are out there, but as for us we\u2019re focused on what we do and what we can control and that\u2019s kind of where our headset is. Hassan Ahmed : You do consider your business pretty core. Mark C. Rohr: Pretty core, is that what you said? Hassan Ahmed : Yes, as in you won\u2019t really be a seller, would you? Mark C. Rohr: Yes, we like it. It makes tremendous amount of money and I know it causes people a little bit of anxiety but I think if you look at it, be mindful there\u2019s a zero tax base on this; be mindful that you\u2019re selling the business is we will have some [indiscernible] over. It\u2019s hard to see how it makes economic sense for shareholders to sell it. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thanks so much, Mark. Mark C. Rohr: Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great. Thank you. Gary, next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Mark, the SO.F.TER. deal is the first chunky one we\u2019ve seen in a little while and I was intrigued by your comment that you expect to make a habit of new deals down the road. Can you talk a little bit about the recent upgrade to investment grade and where you see balance sheet leverage trending over the next couple of years? Is it the case that you would consider yourself underleveraged or more in the case where you\u2019re looking at deploying excess cash and keeping the balance sheet in the same zip code? Mark C. Rohr: Let me start with that, so I\u2019m going to put Chris in a box to say we\u2019re definitely underleveraged but Chris why don\u2019t you take it and explain the point. Chris Jensen : Well, I guess now I know how to answer that question. How much we take on is really going to be correlated to whether we can continue to successfully close some acquisitions. And as Mark mentioned, we\u2019re excited about that becoming more of a habit. So yes, there could be some more leverage. We closed this last bond seven years at one and an eighth, so that\u2019s extremely attractive for us and we\u2019re just trying to think our way through how we turn that into an advantage. By the same token, we understand the constraints of being an investment grade company and we\u2019ll work with that. Mark C. Rohr: Kevin, what we\u2019ve really been doing is we\u2019ve been working for a long time to do two things. One is to build a model. If you look particularly at materials, build a model that is leverageable. So we think we\u2019ve done that and part of that process, as Scott has outlined and shows on Slide 4 I guess it is, is that we think the ultimate test of this process, the ultimate proof of this process will be our ability to go out and acquire businesses that are good fundamental businesses but have not been levered the way we will lever. By that I mean is with the customer breadth we have and depth we have of product. And so we believe that we will be able to take this and multiply the value of this several times. And so you need to think of us as having a view that we can spend a little bit of money, a modest amount, a reasonable amount of money given our cash flow to take on reasonable leverage and get multiples out of that. And so we look at this as a multibillion-dollar accretive model for our shareholders and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. So this is the first and we believe there will be many more and that\u2019s why in \u2013 next year and year after that and year after that is keep growing this out and that machine should add \u2013 it\u2019s going to add a lot of value for our shareholders. Kevin McCarthy : I appreciate the color there, Mark. Second question if I may on productivity, would you address where the 70 million in identified savings might be coming from across your portfolio maybe on a segment basis? And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s premature on the incremental 30 that would get you to 100, but if you\u2019ve got any insight into fertile ground for digging there, we\u2019ll be interested? Chris Jensen : I think we can provide a little more on that in the next call. It is all around the business though it\u2019s not just focused in any one area. I think you can generally think of a lot of this coming from the supply chain. So the good folks at our plants just have a tremendous history of figuring out better ways to do things year-in and year-out. So a lot of this is energy reduction, a lot of it is figuring out how to use lower grade materials and in some cases that\u2019s been worth tens of millions of dollars on a given project. So it\u2019s pretty ingrained in the organization. It\u2019s a skill set that we\u2019ll bring to bear as we continue to do these acquisitions as well. Mark C. Rohr: In January, we\u2019ll give a better distribution of that. Kevin McCarthy : Great. Thank you very much. Mark C. Rohr: Thanks, Kevin. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Kevin. Gary, we\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : The last question comes from David Wang with Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Wang : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had one on the margins within AEM. They\u2019ve come up quite significantly over the past couple of years and I think they\u2019re perhaps some record levels now. I was wondering what you think about the sustainability of these margins considering the same pricing decline at least on a year-on-year basis; however products sufficiently differentiated that you think the current higher level of margin is the run rate going forward or would you see some more pressure on that going \u2013 as you\u2019re looking to the coming years? Scott Sutton : Yes, sure, David. I would say that most of that margin expansion has come from upgrading portfolio, upgrading projects, upgrading commercial activity. The pricing decline that you do see is more about regional mix. However, going forward you see us doing things like the next step, a SO.F.TER. acquisition there, there could be another one after that. So you might see some decline in margin percentage, sort of a slow one over time but of course that is completely offset by the absolute increase in profit. Mark C. Rohr: The deals we\u2019re pulling in, generally speaking, David, it\u2019s impossible to match our margins and it\u2019s impossible to match our return on capital. So they will have a diluted impact to some extent, but as Scott said we think that\u2019s going to be easily understood, easily pointed out to folks. So I would think from a big picture point of view you\u2019re going to see it trend down but that\u2019s not a bad thing. It\u2019s going to trend down for a lot of good reasons. David Wang : And as you guys make these further I guess add-on acquisitions, because we\u2019re lower margin, I was wondering if you can talk about whether or not you think their products are sufficiently differentiated or have some kind of competitive advantage versus what others might be offering? Is there some stability to their margins or can those improve as well for the targets that you would be looking at? Mark C. Rohr: Scott could give a lot of color on this but we do deals not to just do a financial leverage, we really do deals to create a better business model, and a better business model lets everyone prosper. We take the best of what they do and they take the best of what we do and also we combine those together and you get two and two equal five. And you can perform for your more customers better, extract more incremental value because we\u2019re solving bigger problems. So we don\u2019t look at this like a can of soup on the shelf and we\u2019re just buying a different manufacturer of a can of soup. It\u2019s a different concept to us which is technology, access to markets and application expertise and putting those together in a way that we really can solve any problems. So that platform is what we get when we \u2013 and the extension of that platform is what we get when we bring in a new great company like SO.F.TER., and that\u2019s how we extract higher value than let\u2019s say with the value that can of soup is the base of. David Wang : All right, great. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr: Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Great. We\u2019ll wrap things up here. Thanks everybody for your time today. We\u2019ll be around for questions later today. So, Gary, at this point, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Hello and welcome to the Celanese Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thank you, Carrie. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Jensen, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sutton, Executive Vice President and President-Materials Solutions; and Pat Quarles, Executive Vice President and President, Acetyls Chain. Celanese Corporation's fourth quarter 2016 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire this morning before market opened. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com, in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in our posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory remarks from Mark Rohr and then open up for more questions. I'd now like to turn it over to Mark. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Surabhi, and good morning, everyone. Our prepared comments were released with earnings earlier today, so I will keep my comments brief, then open the line for your questions. First, I'd like to share some details about another exciting acquisition just announced this morning. We have agreed to acquire the nylon compounding division of Nilit Plastics. A major independent producer of high-performance nylon fibers and compounds. Nilit Plastics has a comprehensive and functionalized nylon portfolio with operations in Europe and Asia. It is a great fit for Celanese. While the acquisition will be immediately accretive, it will take a bit longer to close, which means the impact on 2017 earnings will be small. However, next year Nilit should add roughly $0.10 of earnings to our portfolio. We are really looking forward to teaming up with our talented colleagues at Nilit to bring new and exciting solutions to our customers. Scott Sutton, who is responsible for our Materials core is also on the call today to share more specifics during the question-and-answer period. Now for our 2016 fully consolidated results. I'm happy to report strong GAAP earnings of $6.19 per share, and recorded adjusted earnings of $6.61 per share. Materials Solutions generated $897 million of core income, an 11% increase year-over-year and a record core income margin of 38%. Volume growth from our opportunity pipeline, engineered materials and gains from productivity enabled us to grow despite headwinds in tow pricing and lower affiliate earnings. We commercialized 1,385 projects last year, which is almost 3 times higher than just a few years ago. Both the Nilit and SO.F.TER. acquisitions are a critical next steps in our Engineered Materials evolution and allow us to extend the success of our pipeline model beyond Celanese legacy polymers. The Acetyl Chain generated core income of $454 million, that's 9% lower year-over-year, but good performance in a very tough margin environment. Commercial and operational flexibility and savings from productivity allowed us to expand core income margins to a record 14.5% for the Acetyl Chain. Looking forward to 2017, we expect another year of strong financial performance for Celanese. Unusually heavy turnaround activity planned for the first half of the year, raw material impact building through the year, plus saluting some unique one-time earnings in the first quarter of 2016 add up to a second half that will be $0.35 to $0.40 half than the first. Advanced Engineered Materials should add $0.35 to $0.45 of adjusted EPS, which will offset the $0.40 of headwinds expected from tow we have previously discussed. The Acetyl Chain should contribute roughly $0.25 to $0.35 of growth over last year, driven by our ability to flex the chain and leverage raw material optionality. These core earnings growth numbers include $100 million of productivity through Celanese. Pat Quarles, who is responsible for Acetyls core is also on the call today to share more specifics about 2017 growth plans. We remain committed to buying back another $500 million worth of shares in 2017 and to continue dividend growth. All in, we anticipate growing adjusted earnings per share in a range of 8% to 11% for the year, which keeps us on track to achieve our 2018 earnings and free cash flow targets. With that, let me turn it back to Surabhi for questions. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Mark. As a reminder, we'd like the callers to limit to one question and one follow-up. Carrie, let's go ahead and get started. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning guys. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just question around AEM, continued very strong growth there. Can you help us size, as we go from say 1,385 launches last year to 1,900 this year? Roughly what's the average size of a bid win, if I guess right 10 or 15 higher or lower than where you guys are at? And then more importantly, when you look at that segment, the last couple of years versus three and four years ago, margins are significantly higher. Can you break down kind of how much of that has come from volume leverage versus how much has come from just spreads between raw materials and pricing? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. So I'll make just a few comments and then maybe have Scott to hop in here, and Scott, you're still here on the call, correct? Can you hear me? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yes, yes. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. I'll start with the last one. When you look at our business, we've grown volume roughly 11% in this business, largely driven by the new products that come in. Be mindful, Duffy, there is a bit of leakage out of that. But I think as a rule of thumb, we've talked about it being half and half volume and contribution as well as price. And then \u2013 so that's really what we're levering to try to go forward. Scott, do you want to try to tackle the strong growth of 1,385 to 1,900 and kind of any rules of thumb you may use for these guys would find beneficial about the contribution of that kind of growth? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, sure. I mean, Duffy, of course these bid sizes vary a lot, and we are running a lot of projects now. But the best way to think about it is, all the projects come together and they add about 15% to our gross revenue. And then we get some level of attrition, maybe around 5%. That's a better way to think of it in aggregate instead of project-by-project. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, could you just give an update on the Ibn Sina expansion on the POM and kind of where that stands? And when that equity kicker will kick in, basically where you increase the size of your holding of that joint venture? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. Sure, I will. And we're going to start-up the POM plant in the middle of 2017. And there's not a large contribution out of that joint venture in 2017. We have start-up expense, which is offset by the equity increase. But it really comes at a perfect time, Duffy. I mean, this is, we need some POM coming into our system to support our growth. So, you'll see the real impact in 2018. Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Terrific. Thanks, guys. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thank you, Duffy. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Carrie, let's move to the next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. I'm just curious on the M&A front. Obviously, another acquisition. Does this represent the extent of your interest in nylon? I mean, I know that was a big topic at the Investor Day in 2015. So, is there more to come here or is it more to come in M&A in general? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well, there's more to come from M&A in general, Vincent. And in that process, when we started out, we really focused a lot in nylon, because it is the fastest growing component in some of the markets like autos, really due to the high-temperature applications. So, could we do more, yes. Will we do more acquisitions, heck, yes in that. So, we're not \u2013 we're really looking for technology and market access. It's not so much a size thing for us. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. I guess, maybe what I was asking was, did this nylon acquisition get you where you wanted to be in terms of size, scale and scope? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well... Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Well, this is Scott. I mean, not yet. I mean, this is really just the third step. We did some organic work. We acquired SO.F.TER. that had a nylon business. Nilit has a higher value nylon business. Now we're pulling all that together and there's probably one more step to go. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just as a follow-up, Mark, you referenced early signs of improvement in the Chinese economy in the press release. Is there anything in particular you're seeing there? And why do you think it's happening there, but not I think as you mentioned in Europe or the U.S.? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well, I think, we've had just some really great success, especially on Materials front. And in China, in particular, over the last year and we expect that to continue into this year. So my response was weighted a bit towards that. So some of the strongest growth we got from a year-over-year percent basis is certainly occurring in China. In a minute, we'll probably get some questions about the Chain business and Pat can talk about some of the trends we're seeing there in China, in raw materials and also some consumptive behavior that leads us to believe there's actually some strength coming out of that business as well. Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Great. Thanks, Vin. Operator : Our next question is from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Good afternoon. Could you breakout a little bit the bridge for the $0.25 to $0.35 of improvement from asset yields? And perhaps by upstream versus downstream within the portfolio or what you see in terms of pricing power to pass through input volatility? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well, I think the best way to do that, when we talk about how the year is teeing up, and what we're doing really to drive value and I'll ask Pat to make some comments on that, Laurence, and we'll go from there. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. This is Pat, Laurence, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think the way you should consider and how China plays into this and what it means for our chain is that we've seen a period now of re-inflation across our industry and particularly strong in China. If we look back from a year-on-year basis, coal is up in China, 83% from the beginning of the year to the end. Methanol is up 61%. That really changes the way in which we flex our model and participate across our global system. And importantly, it changes the slope of the cost curve from Eastern Hemisphere to Western Hemisphere and that really creates opportunities for us to exploit that. If you look back in the fourth quarter, we announced about RMB 1,000 of asset price increases throughout the quarter and by the end of the quarter, we'd realized about RMB 700. So expanding our margin as the quarter went forward, despite the fact that we had raws coming up behind us. That's a really nice dynamic and momentum that we now carry into the new year. And as we move forward from here, we are anticipating an environment in the Western Hemisphere where through a variety of expected maintenance outages, it's going to create some more dynamics that allow us to drive pricing on a real supply/demand basis. And past all of that, you have our continued focus on productivity, right. So we've got about 1,200 to 1,300 projects currently running and productivity across our company. That's an ongoing and continuous focus and we'd expect this year much like the past several to realize about $100 million of net gain from that activity. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Those were the two main drivers, just to be clear, are the pricing and the couple of hundred million, $100 million to $200 million on productivity in that segment, volume trends haven't really changed much? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: I think that's right. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. It's about a net $100 million in productivity for the company and roughly speaking 50-50 typically between the two quarters. Laurence Alexander - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Laurence. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : Next question comes from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey, good afternoon folks. If I can just follow up on that. Pat, where do you see operating rates for Acetic and VAM, A, for the industry and B, for Celanese? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, hi, Frank. Thanks for the question. I think, we tend to look at the market in somewhat segmented ways between Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere, specifically China. And we've been dealing with significant overhead of supply capability in China, but that market's \u2013 you can't just look at operating rates, what you really have to look at is what the cost structure is and how that impacts the global market. So I'd say generally speaking assets outside of China had been running at fairly high rates over the last year. Frankly, they've been running reliably not only ours, but our competition. So that's created some turbulence at the end of last year in VAM. But what will make the difference is incentive for the opportunity for China to be participating in the global market and with the changes in their cost curve, we really see that as a diminishing influence. We saw asset imports out of China and their participation in Southeast Asia really fall off dramatically during the fourth quarter and similarly on VAM where, by the time we got to the fourth quarter, their typically imports were down about two-thirds to three quarters \u2013 exports rather out of China. So that's kind of playing on the balances that we're talking about as we head into this year. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. That's very helpful. And if I could just talk about filter tow, Mark, your guidance now down $0.40. I think it before was like down $0.30 to $0.40, but \u2013 and pricing down 10% in the fourth quarter. I assume that most of the negotiation's done for 2017. Where do you anticipate pricing to be down for 2017? And if I'm not mistaken, I think you indicated that potentially Celanese would consider rationalizing capacity in 2018, where do you stand on that? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, I don't have the exact price numbers, so I'd rather not talk about that. I think classically it's been half and half, volume and price and that's good enough, I think is what I would say on that. As we look forward, we kind of \u2013 I mean when you look at lot of this ripple effect we've had has been really driven by two phenomena. One is the reduction of sales into China, which roll back into the U.S. and Europe and producers there, which is very disruptive. There was some oversupply situations that were working themselves out. And we think this year really is sort of the settling of that. So we have in the past taken steps. We've taken more steps, we think than anyone to rationalize and deal with that. And I think going forward, we'll just take it through the steps necessary for us to take independently, we'll do that. But I think right now we kind of like where we are. We like our cost position where we are, and we're looking for this industry to get some certainty about it and then move forward, again. Last thing I'd say, I think the sale of Solvay is a good thing in terms of settling some of that uncertainty. And so we're looking forward to 2018. Frank J. Mitsch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thank you. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Frank. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Good morning, Bob. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I was hoping to follow-up on Nilit a little bit. I guess, there had been some discussion in the press that you're paying a couple of hundred million bucks for this asset. Would you advise us against seeing some credibility in those reports? And then I know they were both at textile and in engineered products business. Can you give us some sense of the scale and what kind of margins we could expect in the business that you're buying there? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. I'll let Scott talk about the margins. Let me say that we don't comment directly on pricing. What we say is that on average, if you look at our model about 10 times is what our average model should be. And again, we don't talk specifically on this, but Nilit will be on the higher side of that, and SO.F.TER. was a little bit on the lower side of that in that process. And we still have a long ways to go to close this thing. So it's not right to get in too much details about the absolute price. But Scott, you want to tackle sort of the business itself and share more details about the business and where it is that we intend to take it? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. Yeah, sure, Mark. I mean, the Nilit business is a bit higher margin business relative to the SO.F.TER. acquisition we made, but still all these acquisitions we make are going to be a bit dilutive to our own margin. Over time, we intend to bring that up, but it really is the bigger part of our nylon portfolio that we'll have, they're highly specified, mainly in electrical applications, a lot in auto as well. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if I might follow-up and give Chris a chance to say something. I'm curious about the way you guys have issued guidance on an EPS basis for your operating divisions. Why not just give us EBIT changes? And what should we imply for share repurchase or tax rates or something else that might influence what the EPS deltas are for your division? Christopher W. Jensen - Celanese Corp.: Okay. So share account, as Mark said in his comments, well, we plan to execute the other $500 million of share repurchases, so you can do that math, it's in our models to just do that pro rata during the year. But that drives something north of $0.30, if that's the outcome. Taxes, I'll have a better idea when we get through the first quarter, but it's probably in that same range of 18% or so. Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Very good. Thanks, Chris. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Bob. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Mark, your pricing was down in every segment in the quarter, but you sounded optimistic about the uplift from raw materials. I'm wondering is that coming mostly on the Acetyl segment or are you saying you also have pricing in the AEM business to offset raw materials? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. I think what I'll say is I'll start with Pat's segment. Yeah, we actually did a pretty good job, I think managing a pretty rapid level of inflation that went on in that chain. And so I think we have had and we will continue to have the ability I think to manage that inflation and stay at that or ahead of it. The growth and earnings from Pat's business is going to come through his ability really to drive higher and higher margins in that chain. In Scott's business, we've had phenomenal success driving higher pricing, as it relates to the growth we've had in that business. We are facing some inflation in that business and little bit of that is in market this year. I think $25 million to $30 million worth or so of headwinds we expect, Scott, to have to overcome in that business and some of the me too stuff that's out there is going to be hard to do. So, I think net, net you won't see quite as much on the pricing side from his business year-over-year, but that's more of a mix effect than anything else. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then, second question on tow. What are you views on sort of destocking of tow in China versus underlying demand? And do you think we're through that destocking phase? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well, I think \u2013 and maybe I'll ask Scott in a minute, take a few comments on this. But in a fundamental sense, we think that the way we look at it is really what our imports into China going to do. We think the imports into China over some period of time are going away. There is still imported volume going into China and there'll still be imported volume going in this year. But our long-term view is that that is going to go away. And as we go through stocking and destocking in China and consumption trends, which does appear down year-over-year about 8%. I think just directionally, we should all anticipate that that volume into China from outside of China is going to go away. Scott, do you want to make any comments about destocking or changes that you may see in China? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. And P.J., on your first comment there, I mean, the inflection point in demand, the short part of it's probably over. So, there is likely to be a slow decline in underlying smoking demand in China. But it's very slow, maybe 1% a year. The destocking is not over. It's come down. But there is enough stock there to bridge for a little while to do exactly what Mark said. And that has led imports slowly decline to close to zero over two years or three years here. P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, P.J. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Katherine Griffin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. This is Katherine Griffin on for David. Kind of just follow-up on the discussion about Acetyls and acetic acid. Mark, you mentioned, we are looking to see the industry to achieve a level of certainty. Could you talk more about maybe the supply/demand fundamentals behind that or pricing that would get you to that level of certainty? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Well, my uncertainty comment Kathy was more around the tow business and really the status of one of the big sellers there. I may have commingled those for you. No, we're pretty confident on the direction that we see in the Chain business and we're really confident on our model. So as those raw material fundamentals change, as they are changing, we feel comfortable about those changing, we think we'll be able to extract more value. I think maybe one of the things we could share more of them \u2013 I'm looking at Pat, when I say this, there's a little bit of talk about the ripple effect on the cost curve of some of the producers in China versus those outside of China as you look at coal and methanol, what's happening, yeah. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Sure. Yeah. Maybe I'll just put some numbers around that. So if you think about the competition we have in China, these are essentially coal-based guys and many of them are actually integrated on the coal side through methanol as well. So if you take what we can all see on coal prices, we're ending the year at about $100 a ton on coal price and again, methanol up in the kind of the 350s and has actually gone up higher than that as we've gotten into 2017. If you're just looking at your cost structure, they're up about $50 a ton, but the reality is their behavior's going to change because now they have an alternative for the methanol in the market that they didn't have all last year. So effectively, it feels to them like their costs are up about $120 a ton and that's exactly the behavior that we're seeing in the market that's driving our ability to drive margin not only in China, but then to support our expectation that that margin then begins to be driven in the Western Hemisphere as we flex our system towards those opportunities. So that $120 a ton we think is legitimate. We've tested it through a variety of kind of internal ways in which we monitor the market and see it actually realized in our pricing. And I think that's really where the confidence is coming from, that Mark's alluding to. Katherine Griffin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then, so also in terms of your outlook commentary, I know you touched on the signs of recovery in China, but maybe you could elaborate on what trends are you seeing in Europe and the Americas that we do believe that demand is stable or will be stable through 2017? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Sure. Yeah, from the demand side, in the Western Hemisphere, it's been not exciting but it's been steady. And we don't really see that profile changing, if anything, we're seeing consumer confidence increase. We're seeing confidence in housing markets seem to be improving, and that gives us the feeling that, we should have some ability to realize growth as we head into 2017. What's really changing in 2017 isn't so much the demand side, it's how we're seeing the variety of outages associated with maintenance on our assets and others, stacking up here in the first half of the year. Remember the Western Hemisphere is fundamentally and structurally short acetic acid and VAM, and that the market has to balance with Eastern Hemisphere. And so, as the west goes through these maintenance outages, that's just a further shortage that we have to deal with. And that's how we take actions to position ourselves to drive value through those periods, and we see that coming at us here beginning late in the first quarter. Katherine Griffin - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thank you. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hey, guys. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Hey, Mike. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Nice end to the year there. When you think about your triangles that you have for AEM, and you have a lot of different acronyms there, obviously POM and PBT have done well. Any other particular compounds are driving the growth peak? Anything there that has good momentum? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. Scott, do you want to tackle that? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. I sure will. And so, we do have \u2013 we're approaching sort of 20 platforms between the engineered thermoplastics and the elastomers. Other big drivers and the one you mentioned certainly, our ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, we call it GUR, which has high application use in medical, high application use in energy storage, particularly lithium ion batteries is a big driver of growth. But it really is across the board. I mean it's our model. We're almost market agnostic, sort of product agnostic as we walk in to deliver a solution to a customer. So, it really is across the board growth. It's not really focused on just a couple polymer platforms. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. Great. And then, as a quick follow-up, Mark, when you think about the two triangles, I'm sure there will be a nylon triangle. When you think about acquisitions, are there other areas \u2013 is there another one or two areas of focus that could continue to add these little impairments? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. I think, what I'd say rather than talking about specific polymers. Mike, what we have is a really good model. And what we have been saying to investors, as we've rolled this out is, watch how we lever this model internally first and we've been doing that now over a year, and everybody is seeing the results of that. And now we're seeing that platform's delivered again. We think this model is very leverageable, when you combine technology and our expertise for applications with the way we engage with customers. So, when we fantasize about that as a result, there are many ways we could push this. We're trying to stay a bit close to home now and making sure that we have some direct connection to the end market of these goods or we engage with them in some way. But Mike, I think as this year unfolds and we get into next year, it is our intention to continue to continue to add bolt-on acquisitions, what I mean by that is acquisitions that can be assimilated very quickly, that are reasonable in scope and size and really continue to push that out. And at the same time, Scott's got to develop this organization to handle thousands of new introductions per year across the globe. So we just think the model gives us lot of latitude and yes, there are a lot of things we're looking at, but I'll really not say exactly what they are. Michael J. Sison - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Mike. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Your AEM volumes were up 20% in the quarter, how much was organic and how much was from acquisitions? And I see that you paid down your pension liability by about $300 million. So I would assume there might be a book benefit of $24 million next year in your cost structure. Is that part of the $100 million in cost cutting or is that separate? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. So we will start with Pat, talks about volumes. Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yes. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: The question really is for Scott? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: I'm sorry. Scott? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, sure. So the volumes, you're right. I mean, they're up 20% in the fourth quarter, but if you look at it without the SO.F.TER. acquisition benefit, they're up about 13% and on the whole year they're up about 10% organically. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: So the question on pensions, yeah, that math is closed, it's not quite that high, it's closer to 20%, but when you look at all elements of compensation, not just pensions, it's really going to be kind of flattish going into next year. And that just has to do with different awards that we have for different open years, and how those stagger out. Most of our senior leadership compensation is variable in nature based on success of different metrics. And it's \u2013 that's changing really into the new year. So, it's a long way of saying don't count on seeing that 20% hit the bottom-line, because it's part of a bigger package of compensation that's probably more flattish. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: And I think there was a question on productivity as well. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: So think in the productivity piece, we need to target about $180 million to $210 million per year of gross productivity, Jeff to get to the $100 million net. And I mentioned earlier, we're running about 1,214 projects today across the company, that does not include pensions, to get to our target of $100 million. And I think we feel pretty good about where that pipeline sits today to continue to deliver that, that productivity for 2017. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And for my follow-up, your AI operating income decreased sequentially by about $16 million. Now there are some seasonal factors, but can you geographically explain where the $16 million decline comes from? And are you shipping acetic from Singapore into China, because you think that you'd get a better cost price differential? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: I'd say generally speaking, Jeff, if I think about the profile of the business last year and into the fourth quarter, acid was in a very difficult place for the market, exacerbated by extraordinarily difficult kind of input cost in China, and what that cost curve implication was to the market. And I talked about how that's changed. That change really occurred dramatically and throughout the fourth quarter. So, I think about where we began \u2013 the beginning of the fourth quarter and where we ended the fourth quarter in acid in China specifically, dramatic margin improvement there, okay. But if you step back from that and you think about the total chain, we were challenged in VAM really, is where the step down was, as we had some end of quarter dynamics at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter that really made it challenging for us. We see that reversing today, but that's what hit us late last year. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: There were few other small things too, Jeff, in there. We had an unscheduled outage of an operating facility that cost us $5 million or so, so $0.02 or $0.03, let's just say out of that. We also have some currency impacts that popped up quickly and we usually cover those over time, that was another $3 million, $4 million, $5 million. So there is probably not half but you start to press half of that, were some episodic or one-time things, we wouldn't expect to continue going forward. Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thanks so much, Jeff. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Jeff. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to see if you guys can give us an update on \u2013 I know it's a little bit out, but the 2018 look, you've talked about $8.00 to $8.50 in earnings in the past. How does the AEM pipeline development affect that and maybe some of the upstream developments as well as your acquisitions? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Scott, do you want to tackle that? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Look, I would say that I mean the pipeline really supports getting to that level. I mean, you look at what we're going to do this year, but we'll probably commercialize about 1,900 projects. After that, you see the benefits of SO.F.TER. and Nilit kick-in and on top of that, we're growing the organic portion of it too. We hope to have another acquisition in line as well. So, I would say that the trend that helps drive a lot of the growth in AEM is going to continue and we continue to see this volume growth as we look out into 2017. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, just as a follow-up. I think you may have discussed this briefly earlier, but just on the margins in both AEM and tow, I understand tow maybe impacted by some pricing, but still very strong and then AEM, do you see kind of holding these levels, even though you're adding on slightly lower margin businesses? Thanks. Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Okay, yeah. Thank you. In AEM, I mean you'll see a little bit of dilution there. It won't be extensive, but there will be a little bit as we bring in acquisitions that may not be at the same margin level and there's a little bit of raw material price pressure as well that Mark already commented on. There is the tow pricing effect, margins have probably hit a high point in that business, but they'll stay fairly high is the way to think about it. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Christopher W. Jensen - Celanese Corp.: This is Chris. Maybe if I'd just pull that into kind of your original question on 2018, I mean we're still confident, that's our range for 2018 that we put out before. And even more so just want to point you back to free cash flow, that we're confident in $2.5 billion across those three years. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that it should be down a little bit next year. Just to be clear on that, I meant from the $933 million before the pension contribution, not from the $633 million. So it'll be down a little bit in 2017 because of income taxes. So, 2016 had some nice benefits of a lot of capital spending on things that you already know about leading up to that and some bonus tax depreciation deductions that we got for that. So it will be in the $800 millions in 2017 instead of in the $900 millions most likely, but you just add that up, it stacks up to confidence in $2.5 billion, when we go clear out through 2018. Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Arun. Carrie, let's move on to the next question. Operator : The question comes from James Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good afternoon. So, when you mentioned your impact from share buybacks in 2017 being around $0.30, was that the same magnitude that was in your original path to 2017 that you laid out last quarter? Christopher W. Jensen - Celanese Corp.: The path to 2017 or 2018? James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: 2017. Christopher W. Jensen - Celanese Corp.: Oh. Yeah, yeah. I mean we always just assume it will be pro rata, but sometimes it can be lumpy. So, we can update you as we go through the year on on how it's unfolded. But the intention was always $500 million of repurchases in 2017. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And then, in the Acetyls Chain, can you discuss, what is the lag in passing through higher raw materials that you're assuming for 2017? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: So, Pat, do you want? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, I'm sorry I missed that. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: What's the lag on passing through raw materials? Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Well, it ranges anything from instantaneous to the extent that we have contracts tied to those external indexes, what we're able to drive through in the market. Again, I kind of think back to what we're able to do in the fourth quarter in China on the escalation there. Again, I talked about of the RMB 1,000 we announced throughout the quarter, we realized RMB 700 by the end of the quarter, which actually kept us ahead of raws. And if we've got the right kind of market dynamics which I think we have now heading into the first quarter, we should be pretty much on top of it. James Sheehan - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Thank you. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Jim. Carrie, let's take the next question now. Operator : The next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov of Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Good afternoon. Thank you. Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Good afternoon. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : In your filter tow business, have you signed any multiyear contracts? And if so, have you fixed either price or volume commitments? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, do we sign multi-year contracts with price and volume? I mean it's a combination of short-term contracts and longer-term contracts, and it's a combination of terms depending on who they are, where some are volume, some are with price commitments, some have options on price on new release. So it varies depending on who the customer is and what we think we can accomplish. Scott, do you want \u2013 am I saying it the right way? Any comments on that? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: No, I mean in the tow business, there is some multiyear contracts now and for us it's not a giant percentage of our business, maybe up to a third of the business is the way to think about it. They more commonly have a fixed price and a share of volume. So the absolute volume could fluctuate a little bit. Patrick D. Quarles - Celanese Corp.: Yeah, and I would say maybe on the Acetyl side to build that out a little bit, so the thing about acid and VAM, fairly responsive on price. You don't make long-term price commitments because your market's changing too quickly. A business like our (40:51) emulsions can have quarterly pricing. So, kind of tying back to that last question about how quickly our prices respond, that's one area where you'll have some quarterly lag as we reset beginning of each quarter, particularly in Europe. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Great. Thank you, that's very helpful. And turning back to organic volume growth in the AEM business, is double-digit growth something we could expect in 2017 or high single-digit is I think that was your prior target of something what we should expect in 2017? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Scott? Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. And so this is Scott. Yeah. Thanks. I mean, I still think that the high single-digits is the right place to be when you think about our organic growth profile. Obviously, we're adding significant growth from acquisitions, but in terms of organic, I think high single-digit is a good place to be on average. Aleksey Yefremov - Instinet LLC : Thank you very much. Scott McDougald Sutton - Celanese Corp.: Sure. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Thanks, Aleksey. Carrie, let's move on to our next question and let's make it our last one. Operator : Okay. Our last question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. On the innovation model in AEM, does it extend to the JVs or would you need to have control for the JVs to be able to get the benefit of the new innovation model? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: Yeah. Not so much. I mean, it's \u2013 we're working with our joint venture partners, so we can drive more of it in there. I think in some we're \u2013 it's fully involved in it. You can look at PPS for us, in others, it's a little more distant relationship. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : And then, your basic and most of it is polymers, but you're only in compounding in nylon. With the Nilit capacity to consume nylon, would you be a big enough consumer to consider maybe even having a JV with a nylon producer or somehow accessing polymer capacity? Mark C. Rohr - Celanese Corp.: If it makes sense, we would. We're pretty \u2013 there's not a lot of shortage in nylon out there, and we're pretty comfortable with our position right now in it. But certainly having access to some nylon and/or specialty nylons could be pretty attractive for us. John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney - Celanese Corp.: Carrie, that's it. We'll wind up the call now. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

Baird & Co. Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Celanese First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Annette. Good morning and welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Jensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer; and Pat Quarles, Executive Vice President and President, Acetyls Chain. Celanese Corporation's first quarter 2017 earnings release was distributed via business wire yesterday after market closed. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our Web site, www.celanese.com in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in our posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our Web site in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then open-up for your questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Mark now. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Surabhi. Welcome to everyone listening in today. Our prepared comments were released with earnings yesterday, so I will limit my comments, then open the line for your questions. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated GAAP earnings of $1.30 per share, and the second-highest ever adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share. In the Acetyl Chain, raw material prices were sharply higher sequentially and the Chain business responded well by dropping price increases globally. We remain aggressive in our commercial approach and selected when and where we place our Acetyl molecules. This has allowed us to expand core income margins every month this quarter, up 200 basis points sequentially to 13.6% overall. For the first quarter, the Acetyl Chain generated core income of $108 million. Materials Solutions had another record quarter generating core income of $243 million. Advanced Engineered Materials segment income of $143 million was an all-time high and volume grew 35% sequentially driven by double-digit organic growth and contributions from the SO.F.TER. acquisition. We also closed 513 projects in the quarter, which puts us well on track to achieve our targeted 1,900 projects for the year. The SO.F.TER. integration is progressing well and we expect to close previously announced Nilit Plastics acquisition in May. Consumer Specialties' segment income in the quarter was $100 million, with 46% segment income margin. Tow volume increased sequentially due to unique carryovers from 2016 as we transition contracts, but was offset by decline in pricing due to lower industry utilization rates previously discussed. We continue to expect 2017 earnings from Consumer Specialties to reset at $0.40 per share lower than 2016 and stabilize from there. During the quarter, we invested $128 million to repurchase shares and along with dividends we returned $179 million to our shareholders. I also want to congratulate our team this quarter for the results and their tireless efforts and support of customers and shareholders. Looking forward to the rest of the year, Advanced Engineered Materials will contribute meaningfully to sales and earnings in 2017 through growth from new project commercialization and emerging benefits of SO.F.TER. and Nilit integrations. The Acetyl Chain is strategically positioned to take advantage of evolving industry and raw material environments and it also advance growth. While tow headwinds, muted industrial demand, and uncertainty in raw materials were challenged. We are off to a very good start for the year and we expect earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% this year with the second half about $0.20 higher than the first half. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019d like to request everybody on the phone to limit your questions to one and then a follow-up. Anita let's go ahead and get started with a Q&A, please. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Laurence Alexander : Two quick ones. How much of a drag was VAM year-over-year, and do you expect the lost volumes or the volumes that you sacrificed to come back in the back half of the year or in 2018? And then on acetate tow, can you speak to your relative leverage to regular cigarettes versus -heat-not-burn cigarette? And what that -- what those products might have as an impact? Mark Rohr : Yes, I will start, maybe have Pat who is here make a few comments on VAM, but if you look at the wall quarter-to-quarter, the VAM impact was pretty material for us, fourth quarter and the first quarter and probably half of the down side we saw on a margin basis. So when I think through that, and the other half being TSO and some other things that are going on. So VAM was pretty material. Pat, you want to comment maybe on a forward look of -- for VAM? Pat Quarles : Yes, sure. Hi, Laurence. This is Pat Quarles. Mark is right, I mean, fairly material versus last year. If you think about what happened to us in China, with the extraordinarily strong ethylene which were based on for VAM process versus carbide producers more tied to coal we had very strong ethylene in the first quarter. Puts us in situation where we'd rather just not participate in the market in China during that period and take a little pressure off of other peoples drive to export which we think benefits us in the rest of the world. So that was really what drove our decision-making in the first quarter as we get into the second quarter ethylene remains high in China. That dynamic really hasn't changed. What\u2019s changing of course is this overall utilization of the system, because the multitude of outages that we and others were having in the market and where we're actively meeting customer demand, both through our Western Hemisphere assets as well as actually bringing molecules in from China to meet those commitments we have elsewhere. Mark Rohr : Well, Laurence, the other question if I understood was really around e-cigarettes and maybe smokeless tobacco and the trends there, is that what you -- is that your question? Laurence Alexander : Exactly, more in the smokeless tobacco side, I think e-cigarettes have been flogged almost to death? Mark Rohr : So I will let Scott Sutton, if you will, take a shot at that. Scott Sutton : Yes. Hi, Laurence. Look, I mean the reality today is that a small part of our tow business actually goes into heat-not-burn devices. It's something on the order of 1%. Most of our business goes into traditional cigarettes and superslim cigarettes. However, what\u2019s going into heat-not-burn is growing very quickly and on top of that we have quite a number of projects in our engineered materials pipeline or thermoplastics to go into those heat-not-burn devices. Laurence Alexander : Okay. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Laurence. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Thank you. For Mark or maybe Pat, you guys had mentioned previously a acceleration in AI profits in the second half. I\u2019m wondering, if you can help us if that cadence still holds and what causes the uplift in the second half? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yes, we do -- I mean, we\u2019re seeing profits accelerate now as we go through in this raw material inflation that\u2019s going on really driven by China, but around the world. So we are expecting that to continue as we go through the year. Pat, you want to maybe\u2026? Pat Quarles : Yes, sure. So if you think through market dynamics, you heard me say before, a variety of outages going on that we\u2019re in the middle of that, we and others. That is actually continue throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter. So our expectation is from our businesses results, we will see margin expansion as we\u2019re currently seeing into the second quarter. But we\u2019re constrained on the supply, right because our Clear Lake unit is out for a period of time and as that returns in the third quarter we expect to still have pretty good market dynamics and we get the benefit of volume contribution in the back half of the year and that\u2019s what gives us that profile, Bob. Robert Koort : Thanks. And is there anything -- for Scott, is there anything specific to the SO.F.TER. earnings stream this quarter that depress the margin so substantially or is that something we should expect at a similar level going forward? Scott Sutton : Yes. Hi, Bob. This is Scott. So, yes, I mean, SO.F.TER. is getting to the point where it is closer to being fully integrated. So you do see some depression on margin percentage for a while. Over time, we will be able to bring those up, but that is primarily what was responsible for the little lower margin percentages in our Advanced Engineered Materials business in the first quarter. Mark Rohr : Yes, Bob, we\u2019ve -- I don\u2019t know if we missed it or didn\u2019t communicate it well enough, but we\u2019ve talked about these businesses you\u2019re bringing in being at the very low double-digit margin levels when they first come in. So contributions of maybe $0.10 for this quarter from SO.F.TER. -- I mean, for this year from SO.F.TER. and much, much less than that in Nilit, it would be like $0.10 next year. So, you\u2019re looking at multiyear process of getting these businesses up to margin levels that are more consistent than what we would expect in this arena. Robert Koort : Got it. Thanks. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Bob. Anita, let\u2019s take our next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Mike Leithead : Hey, guys. This is actually Mike Leithead sitting in for Duffy. Mark Rohr : Hey, Mike. Mike Leithead : I guess \u2013 hey, Mark, obviously a strong start to the year, but a lot of moving pieces you've acknowledged kind of with raw material volatility, mixed signals on global demand. I guess, when you look broadly across your portfolio, do things today feel better than when the year started or maybe there are some incremental headwinds you have to fight through? Mark Rohr : No, they feel better. I mean the raw material movements has have been sharper perhaps than we anticipated. Those are my words. If you look at it on a full-year basis -- on a full-year basis, we\u2019re expecting as much as $200 million, maybe $250 million of inflation year-over-year, full-year kind of look at that. So you\u2019re going to have movements and we just had a little chunk of that so far in the first quarter, certainly less than $40 million of gross raw material inflation. So we're looking at a pretty volatile raw material environment, Mike, and that\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t mind volatility. We always like it. Of course we\u2019re going to predict it, but a little volatility is not a bad thing. And so as we got this year we\u2019re going to see some movement quarter-to-quarter in margins and maybe little bit reflection of that volatility, but we\u2019re pretty excited about how the year is stacking up. Mike Leithead : Great. And then just one more quickly on the volume growth in AEM. Can you help size for us the impact of SO.F.TER. this quarter? I guess, I'm just trying to get better idea of how well the base business performed in the quarter for AEM? Mark Rohr : Yes, sure. I mean, one thing here, Mike, I don\u2019t want to get too specific on continuing to break out SO.F.TER. because it is becoming integrated. But what I will say is that without SO.F.TER. the number of projects is still an all-time record. The growth in volume is still double-digit regardless whether you look a year-ago or the quarter before. So SO.F.TER. contributed right on plan, but still the organic business is the big driver. So, [have to have] [ph] for less is what I would say. Pat Quarles : In terms of volume and projects, clearly the organic business is the big driver. In terms of profit contribution, SO.F.TER. probably contributed 30% of the profit growth. Mark Rohr : Yes, yes. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks, guys. Mark Rohr : Okay. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Mike. Let's take our next question, Anita. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Frank Mitsch : You mentioned some of the outages at Clear Lake, both I guess the acetic acid unit and the methanol unit are off-line and I saw that you guys are also running your Singapore facility at reduced rates here in Q2. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re sizing the financial impact of these outages are? Mark Rohr : No, we\u2019re not going to break it down that way. What we will say is that it\u2019s a six week kind of outage. I think the gross expenditures will press $50 million. The entire complex is down. So not only the Celanese sites here, but also the other site partners. So it's a -- by any measure it's a very big outage and we're replacing our utility pipeline, utility kind of systems and the process. So, we haven't broken that down in there, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Well, so it's a six weeks and you\u2019re saying the capital cost about $50 million bucks? Mark Rohr : In expense. Scott Sutton : In expense. Frank Mitsch : And at this point, with reduced production of VAM, I mean, I\u2019m guessing that the market is going to be pretty damn tight when you come back in. Is that not how we should be thinking about AI, once we get past these outages, because you also have some major outages over in Asia, not you per se, but the industry? Mark Rohr : [Indiscernible] qualifiers on there, pretty and damn. So I think it's going to be pretty tight, I don\u2019t know if it was damn tight, but -- so yes, the market is tightening up a little bit, that's right. Frank Mitsch : Right. Pat Quarles : Frank this is Pat. I mean, I think, you see that expressed in the profile that we\u2019ve talked about, the cadence across the quarters, right and that\u2019s exactly those dynamics we\u2019re talking about that are reflected there. Mark Rohr : Yes. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Frank. Let's take the next question, Anita. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Mark, China has been shutting down a lot of coal-based capacity in various chemicals, whether it's urea, caustic. How is that impacting the Acetyls Chain, given the backward integration into coal? And could that suggest sort of a turning point in Acetyls in the future? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think -- maybe Pat may have some clarity here too, but when you look at a very high level, I think China is holding true to their perspective that coal gasification as it relates to our business is not going to be increased in China, it's going weigh in. And so you see an evidence of that starting to occur. You're also seeing China push and support indirect with sort of higher coal pricing as well, if for nothing else to fund the kind of investment they need to start cleaning up their technology around coal. So, we\u2019re seeing that as setting the higher foundation, raw material cost foundation for China, which is a very good thing. The other thing that we\u2019ve talked about in the past is the addition of MTO in China and the impact that\u2019s having on methanol, and one that Pat and Scott remind me all the time is, is China gets the MTO really running, then they really are a net importer -- methanol is going to come from somewhere else. It's not going to come from China nor is methanol likely to be built in China. So my personal view is that, that source versus let's say in the last several years that\u2019s going to reset. There is couple of years going forward to a higher base level cost position for those materials in China, which net-net is good for the industry. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And just secondly on filter tow. Your prices are down 8%, volume is down 2%. Do you believe that 2017 could be sort of the final year of de-stocking and then you could see at least volumes begin to improve in 2018 or is that too optimistic? Mark Rohr : I think we\u2019ve said 50-50 on average at $0.40 between volume and price. So you can see a little bit of movement around when that settles as we go through this year. I don\u2019t know how to really answer your question. I think, we do really believe that it is going to set the foundation and we hope that next year it doesn't. There are early signs to deteriorate next year. They shouldn't, but that's kind of where we are. I don\u2019t know if Scott if you had anything? Scott Sutton : No, I think that that\u2019s right. I mean 2017 is at or near our floor and we\u2019re working actions to help that. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, P.J. Let's take our next question, Anita. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, David. David Begleiter : Hey, Mark, in Q1 you beat expectations, but you did not raise full-year guidance. You mentioned there was some challenges on raw materials. Was anything else besides raw that held you back from perhaps raising guidance for the full-year? Mark Rohr : No, I just didn\u2019t want to roll it out there, but I think our year is back-end loaded and if you look at that there is a lot more loaded in the back-end of the year and that means that just increases your risk, so I thought it was prudent not to roll it in. Let's see how we perform this quarter and our view from there and we would be in a better position to call the full-year then. David Begleiter : Understood. And question for Scott. Scott, just on the auto exposure in AEM given some weakness in that end market, can you discuss your exposure and how you might offset that end-market weakness going forward? Scott Sutton : Yes, I mean, we\u2019re certainly less exposed to auto than we used to be. It's still a critical segment to us, maybe it's a third or less of our exposure there, but again our big driver is our model and our project pipeline system and we\u2019ve a tremendous number of projects that are in the auto area that aren't necessarily dependent on overall auto volume growth. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thanks, David. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, David. Anita, let's take our next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Hi, good morning. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Last year you had a really strong quarter in Acetyl Intermediates where your volumes grew mid-single-digits and this year in the first quarter they were down low double digits. And methanol prices also really lifted year-over-year and I think you transfer raw materials at cost from AI to AEM. So with some of the margin deterioration in AEM due to higher raw material costs that were embedded in Acetyl Intermediates both from the change in volume and from the change in methanol prices. Mark Rohr : You know our -- I will let [indiscernible] but our transfer prices is pretty darn close to market, Jeff. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. Mark Rohr : So, we don't -- we work hard to try not to shift things around, I will put it that way, and there is a little curve, probably but \u2026. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. And then you took a $27 million contract cancellation charge in ethanol, what exactly was that? And was that -- did that cash flow go out in the first quarter or will that go out in the future quarters? Chris Jensen : So, the cash did not go out, and a lot of these contracts in the Acetyl Chain on the supply side, well I wouldn't say a lot, but there are a handful of very key supply streams where your vendor is really setting up shop there for you and making a huge investment. So, if you think of the industrial gas company business model, that's what it is. So you\u2019re signing long-term contracts that allow them to recover their capital that they incurred for you or for us. So that number is essentially the present value of what we owe them over time. So it will be paid over time. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Jeff. Anita, let's move to our next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thanks and good morning. Just, Scott, you mentioned that you\u2019re working on some unlisted [ph] projects or some things to, I guess help the consumer acetate tow business. And I guess, what you're talking about maybe some production reductions of your own, number one. And then this is a follow-up, you guys think that the stability can take place in tow in 2018 without any production coming out from yourself or from other industry parties? Scott Sutton : Yes, I mean, Vincent, what I will say is, we\u2019re always working on a number of things, but specifically there is a lot of productivity work going on in the tow business and that can involve assets, it can also involve co-producer arrangements too. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And just as a follow-up, on AEM the JV income was a bit stronger than we expected. Was there anything specific to this quarter and in terms of the balance of the year, I think you will have a turnaround in 2Q, but is there anything we should think about as we model the JV income for the balance of the year? Scott Sutton : Yes, I mean, I don\u2019t think there is anything to really highlight. It was a stronger quarter sequentially than before, it probably won't be quite that strong in the next couple of quarters coming up, but it's not far off. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thanks very much. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Vincent. Anita, we will take our next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. So you guys have pointed to about 8% to 11% growth in 2017 on EPS. If we take a similar look at '18, we get to about $8. In the past, you\u2019ve talked to $8 to $8.50. So, would you need additional M&A to get to the upper end of that range, or are you still looking at that as achievable? And maybe you can just talk about the pipeline a little bit. Mark Rohr : Yes, when we rolled out those numbers out, they were -- the $8 to $8.50 was with -- without M&A, but at the same token we did not anticipate the well over $100 million drop that we\u2019ve seen in value coming out of the cellulose -- cellulosics business. So, we need M&A to cover that, so we need M&A to contribute $0.50 to $0.60, I would say to have a shot at that. So we probably are going to do a little more M&A to make sure that\u2019s there. Arun Viswanathan : And then, maybe you can just, as a follow-up talk about your cash use plans and the pipeline a little bit. Are you still looking at splitting that between M&A and buybacks? Thanks. Chris Jensen : So, we have a authorization that would allow us to do about $500 million this year, and that\u2019s currently our intention is to do $500 million of share repurchases in 2017. At that point, that authorization ends, so we will be talking more soon about changing uses of cash and what that looks like, but if we\u2019re successful on executing continued bolt-on acquisitions, it will be difficult to sustain that kind of pace of share repurchases. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you. Anita, we will move on to the next question. Operator : Next question is from James Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson and Humphrey. Please go ahead. Matthew Stevenson : Hi. This is Matthew Stevenson on for Jim. Is the demand environment in China following the Chinese New Year sufficient to support the recent price movements, the favorable price developments in Acetyls there, or is it purely a result or only being supported by the tight supply due to outages there? Pat Quarles : Hey, Matthew. It's Pat. I would love to tell you that the demand is driving a big change in margin performance in China, but the reality is it's a oversupplied market today. So we\u2019re really watching kind of short-term dynamics in our ability to make choices in our Chain, in our plans to kind of benefit ourselves and influence as much as we can. We\u2019ve been talking about the higher coal cost environment that really started in the second half of last year and continued into the first quarter. And that put many of our competition in a position where they want to drive price and they\u2019ve been doing that, we've been doing that and that\u2019s benefited us ultimately on margin as well. I think the dynamics that we talk about in terms of outages is primarily a Western Hemisphere dynamic and as we\u2019ve said we\u2019ve seen that developing throughout the first quarter in a very positive way and we feel good about where we\u2019re headed in the second quarter. Matthew Stevenson : Understood. And in terms of the cadence of earnings throughout the year, when you reported your 4Q results, you were indicating, I think it was $0.35 to $0.40 higher earnings in the second half of '17 compared to the first half of '17, now that\u2019s been reduced. And at least compared to where numbers were, it seems like the difference came out of consumer. Can you -- maybe elaborate on that? Mark Rohr : I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m actually -- can you repeat the first part of your question. I\u2019m sorry, I missed it. Matthew Stevenson : Sure. So, I believe the guidance now is for the second half of 2017 to see earnings per share of about $0.20 higher than the first half of '17 and that\u2019s less of a step-up in the second half than we had previously been anticipating? Mark Rohr : Right. Matthew Stevenson : And so, I wonder if you could elaborate on that and just based on your performance versus consensus by segment, it seems like that came out of consumer, like out of the tow business. So I\u2019m not sure, if that\u2019s accurate to some extent or if you can elaborate on what is driving those dynamics? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think you\u2019re being a bit too mathematical with this whole process. We started the year with a view that to make our numbers that we knew, it had to happen as we needed to see raw material inflation which is incurring, and we needed to capitalize on that, which we\u2019re doing. And so -- and that was back end loaded. So we\u2019re expecting this inflation to actually grow as we go through the year. We\u2019ve had roughly $40 million of what will be, we think well over $200 million for the year. So you can see, its more heavily back end loaded. So we were pushing as much as $0.40 of earnings in the back half of the year. So now we got one quarter under our belt, we actually -- we\u2019re just not -- to be honest I\u2019m not taking credit for that. I think we need to get into the year a little bit more and see how that inflation occurs and just validate we can extract the kind of value from what we think we can and then, we will talk about how to adjust at the end of next quarter for the year, but it's not more than that. Matthew Stevenson : Understood. Mark Rohr : It's just a high level haircut for the back half of the year. Matthew Stevenson : Understood. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Yes. Surabhi Varshney : Anita, we will move -- go ahead Anita. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Could you quantify any benefit of productivity initiatives that that you achieved in the first quarter? Mark Rohr : Yes, yes. We\u2019ve a $100 million in for the year and we were roughly on pace that might be a little bit higher than that in the first quarter and that\u2019s pretty evenly split between the groups, yes. Aleksey Yefremov : Got it. Thank you. And then, just turning back to Acetyls, could you help us understand the total EBIT impact of the outages in the second quarter if we look sequentially versus the first quarter, including the missed opportunity and the actual cost that will not be capitalized? Mark Rohr : Yes, we don\u2019t really break it down that way. So I\u2019m not trying to withhold that. I just don\u2019t have it in front of me, Alex, to break it down that way. I mean we will have \u2026 Chris Jensen : And we have some expense in the first quarter already. Mark Rohr : Yes. Chris Jensen : We are already -- we were spending money in the first quarter as we got into it. So you have volume metrics as well as higher expense in the second quarter. Aleksey Yefremov : But I guess, directionally, is it going to get worse in the second quarter or stay at about the same level? Mark Rohr : Did you say AEM of Acetyls? Pat Quarles : Acetyls. Aleksey Yefremov : Acetyls. Mark Rohr : Yes, it's going to stay roughly the same level, I'd say going through the quarter, maybe a little better, yes. Aleksey Yefremov : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Yes. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Aleksey. Anita, we will take our next question. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. Just to triangulate a little more on the AEM earnings growth, you mentioned double-digit organic growth in AEM or the earnings from the legacy wholly-owned AEM operations also up double-digit? Scott Sutton : Yes, and so -- this is Scott. Look, the legacy earnings growth quarter-to-quarter is -- if you take out the affiliates, right which I\u2019m -- we\u2019re going to the nature of your question, right. So it's not quite double-digit, but what we haven't talked about, and I will just put it out there now is that quarter-on-quarter regardless of whether its fourth quarter last year and first quarter last year. There is about a double-digit millions of dollar charge for inventory adjustments sitting in our first quarter this year, and it just has to do with the fact that we ran down our inventory due to sales. So that\u2019s sitting there. So, if you take that out, it's certainly double-digit earnings growth to support a double-digit volume growth. Mark Rohr : Yes, last year, we were building inventory for a big turnaround. And this year with the success of sales and what we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, we\u2019re having to pull a lot of inventory. So it was a pretty good charge in there and that mask a little bit of the -- what Scott was talking about. John Roberts : And then, Scott, you gave us these project count numbers in terms of new projects launched and backlog. Is there a way to qualify the quality of the backlog? I\u2019m sure there is long cycle project, short cycle products, there is higher profitability and lower profitability, is it homogenous enough that we can use the raw project count as a good metric? Scott Sutton : Well, I think the growth in the projects that are closed are a good marker. I think our pipeline, we currently -- we\u2019re working on 4,000 or 5,000 projects right now, supports growing that closure rate year in and year out. John Roberts : Okay, but you wouldn't expect much mix effect -- that the raw count will actually be a good metric? Scott Sutton : Well, I think the number of closes of projects is a good metric to judge how the business is doing. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Mark Rohr : You bet. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, John. Anita, we will take our next question. Operator : Next question comes from Bobby Geornas with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Bobby Geornas : Good morning. Just a question on the raw material spike. Given the increased raw materials in Q1 and subsequent price initiatives that you\u2019ve gone after, to what extent do you see the potential for actual margin expansion in Q2 and as we progress through the year, or the increases that have been announced sort of merely intended to catch-up with the increase in raws? Pat Quarles : Yes, so that inflation of raw input started late in the fourth quarter, and we talked about that during the first quarter earnings call -- the fourth quarter earnings call a few months ago and that really continued. We\u2019ve actually been successful swimming upstream faster than those increases. So we\u2019ve expanded margins really in every product line in Acetyls, really with the exception of the China VAM comment that I made earlier, and we\u2019re only frankly just getting started in a lot of ways, because the real tightness due to these outages in the Western Hemisphere began to settle into the market late March and into April. So, yes, we\u2019re expecting continued margin expansion into the second quarter and feel pretty good about that where we sit today. Bobby Geornas : Okay. And just one clarification question. Earlier you mentioned there is a $250 million sort of full-year headwind from raw materials. Are you saying that about $40 million of that you had experienced in Q1? Pat Quarles : Yes, those are gross numbers. So, I\u2019m not giving you the net, some of that is past due, some of that we have to really fight to cover, but yes we had about $40 million, I think it was $38 million to $40 million of gross inflation in major raw materials and energy through the first quarter. Bobby Geornas : Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Bobby. Anita, let's move on to our next question. Operator : Next question comes from the Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Mark, obviously a lot of sort of conversations around the spikes in raw material prices that we\u2019ve seen. Obviously, it seems that methanol at least, as I take a look at the spot market and certain new sort of contract pricing that\u2019s coming out, there seem to be signaling some methanol pricing declines. Now similarly on the ethylene side, there is a perception in the marketplace that as turnaround season is over and as more capacity comes online, ethylene pricing may come under pressure as well. So obviously, I mean cutting through all of this, it seems that raws may continue to be volatile at least in the near-term. So my question really is, as we\u2019re seeing all of these ups and downs in product pricing, are you seeing buyer patterns change, meaning are you seeing people holding leaner levels of inventory or destocking or any of those elements? Mark Rohr : Yes, you see all those things every day. I mean that\u2019s everybody tries to guess what raws are going to do and take an advantage of anywhere they can. What we see with raws is that if you look at year-over-year, so just from a year-over-year basis, I\u2019m pretty confident we will be several hundred million dollars higher, but when we end this year than last year, how that actually rolls out quarter-to-quarter. We had a spike up in methanol. We had a major outage of the world's largest MTO plant, and they dumped \u2026 Chris Jensen : 400. Mark Rohr : 400 tons. Chris Jensen : KT [indiscernible]. Mark Rohr : KT in the market, to press the market, you are kind of working through that today. So, I think you are going to see that kind of volatile movement, but the broader trend is that we\u2019re seeing higher and higher inflation, and I think broadly speaking, there is a limit to what you can do long-term to deal with that. I mean long-term it's got to be processed through the value chain. Short-term you may be -- you may hold back a decision to buy or you may build some inventory or do things like that. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. Now on a different topic, you guys talked about through the course of this year, if I\u2019ve heard this correctly, essentially taking the entire $500 million of share buyback authorization sort of spending cash on that. So my question basically is that, as I take a look at the 52-week sort of trading range of your shares, they\u2019ve been in the low 60s, they\u2019ve been in the low 90s. So -- and obviously today they\u2019re closer to the high-end of it rather than the low-end. So does that change the sort of thought process or calculus around buybacks, I mean meaning, do you still feel that you will be able to sort of do the full $500 million or does that decelerate a bit? Mark Rohr : I don\u2019t change the calculus, I mean we -- the earnings have been growing in the Corporation without the equity base has been growing in the Corporation. We expect to continue to grow earnings. We expect to be $8, $8.50 at the end of the next year. So you can -- if you want to do math on that, you can forecast in what you think the share price is going to be next year, but we\u2019re expecting that -- we\u2019re expecting earnings to grow and we\u2019re expecting share price to grow. So we look at from an intrinsic value and we think that the shares today are priced in a way that they\u2019re still quite attractive. So we\u2019re on pace to do that $500 million this year. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thanks so much, Mark. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Hassan. Anita, we will move on to our next question. Operator : The next question comes from David Wang, Morningstar. Please go ahead. David Wang : I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the margins for AEM segment. I know we talked about this a little bit already, but I wanted to get some more clarity around if we saw any margin compression in that legacy business or was it mostly due to SO.F.TER? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of that 3% kind of looks like year-on-year pricing decline. Do we see that in which segment of the AEM business? Scott Sutton : Yes, so, hi. I mean this is Scott. Look, I mean it's really two principle drivers. One is that SO.F.TER. is now integrated into our business, so that brought some lower margins in and the other key driver that is what I talked about before, right, is this double-digit millions inventory charge in the first quarter that wasn\u2019t there in other quarters as well. So those two things principally dropped the margin down. David Wang : All right. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Okay. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, David. Anita, let's take one more question and that will be the last for the call today. Operator : Our last question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys, good morning. Mark, just going back to your comments on inflation and just to clarify in the $200 million plus in growth inflation. In your 8% to 11% earnings guidance, are you assuming that you fully offset that growth inflation number for 2017? Mark Rohr : Oh, yes. Chris Jensen : Yes. Ghansham Panjabi : Good. Okay, great. And then also in terms of the \u2026 Mark Rohr : [Multiple speakers] The only way I can answer that, but it's yes, hell yes, we expect to offset it. Ghansham Panjabi : That\u2019s what I wanted to hear. And then just going back to the VAM pricing environment in China, can you just give us a sense as to the difference in production cost during the first quarter and has there been any improvement into 2Q thus far? Mark Rohr : Yes, so the dynamic in VAM in China really changed towards the end of the year beginning of this year, when essentially the relative competitiveness of the carbide VAM producers and the ethylene VAM producers switched and changed both our behavior as well as theirs. So it was towards the end of the quarter, really just that light switch flipped on us. So as a result, then we really minimized rates early in the first quarter backed away from influencing the market with production in the market if needed, and the carbide guys kind of fill that space. That dynamic still exists today. I mean, ethylene remains very strong. It's pushing over $1,200 a ton again. So we will need to monitor ethylene that's going to judge what we need to be doing inside China. That capacity is still competitive on an export basis to fill in some supply commitments that we\u2019ve made, so we do move a little bit out of China to ensure we keep our customers supplied. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Ghansham. Surabhi Varshney : We will wrap up the call now. Thank you, everyone for your questions and for listening in this morning. We will be around if you\u2019ve any further questions. Anita, I will turn the call over to you now. Operator : This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird Kevin McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to Celanese Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Jamie. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Jensen, Chief Financial Officer; Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer; and Pat Quarles, President Acetyls Chain. Celanese Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market closed. The slides for the call and our prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website, www.celanese.com in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in our posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then open-up for your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark now. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Surabhi, and welcome to everyone listening in today. We have posted our prepared remarks along with earnings yesterday, so I'll limit my comments and then open the line for questions. First a few performance highlights. We successfully completed the Clear Lake, Texas site turnaround to repair and upgrade unit operations, on-time, on-budget and injury free. We also made significant progress with SO.F.TER and Nilit integrations and announced an agreement with Blackstone to form a new European-based cellulose acetate company to better support global customers and technology. In the second quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $1.72 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.79 per share, both second quarter records. In the second quarter, we returned $237 million of cash to investors, with $172 million in share repurchases. By the end of 2017, we expect to have completed $500 million worth of share repurchases. And as you have probably seen, we just announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion. The Acetyl Chain income came in at $132 million, that\u2019s 19% higher year-over-year, driven by commercial agility and production flexibility. Product swaps and regular supply chain planning allows Celanese to participate in the market and overtime production limitations at Clear Lake as well as industry supply constraints. Income margin for the Acetyl Chain was 16% driven by pricing improvements. Materials Solutions increased net sales to a record of $709 million in the second quarter, as rapid growth in Advanced Engineered Materials outpaced the decline in acetate tow volume and price. AEM reported a second highest ever segment income of $142 million, 28% higher than the same quarter last year. Volume increased double-digits year-over-year driven by SO.F.TER. and Nilit, organic growth and greater penetration in China. As expected, segment income margin for AEM was 290 basis points lower year-over-year, with integration of recent acquisitions and growth in Asia. The team closed a record of 547 projects in the quarter, allowing us to increase a target for projects close in 2017 by 5% to roughly 2,000. In Consumer Specialties, segment income in the second quarter was $79 million, in line with our previous guidance. Tow price and volume were lower year-over-year driven by reduced industry utilization rates. We expect earnings for the third and fourth quarter 2017 to be around the second quarter level and with 2018 results would be in line with 2017. For the rest of 2017, there are a number of efforts are underway to utilize our unique commercial models and leverage our operational flexibility. Record numbers of projects commercializations and strategies to take advantage of raw material volatility will extend the second quarter success throughout the year. We are therefore increasing our expectations for adjusted earnings per share growth to be in the 9% to 11% range for 2017. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. I would like to request our callers to please to limit to one question and a follow-up. Jamie, please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Robert Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Robert Koort : Thanks very much and maybe this would be for Pat, but trying to get some better sense of exactly Mark that you -- so elegantly talked about commercial agility and production flexibility. Can you give us some more specifics on what the heck you did in acetic [indiscernible] stop quite a bit of volatility on pricing in raw there? And then how should we think about that business in the second half? I know earlier in the year you talked about a nice uptick in the second half, is that still something we can expect in acetic? Mark Rohr : Let me -- I'll take the last question and Pat, it's -- it's quite better Pat answers your first Bob, but yes, we are seeing trends to that we had hoped to us, that gives us some comfort that we are going to be moving this business up in the third quarter. So, yes, I think that broad trend that we had reflected earlier in the year is there and that\u2019s why we reaffirmed and also upped our guidance just a little bit. But Pat, do you want to talk about the commercial agility? Pat Quarles : Sure. Hey, Bob. So, if you think about our priorities, we entered the second quarter, yes, there were a few things in front of us. Our turnaround, priority number one is don\u2019t let it get by hurt as they come on to our side, we had over 1,200 new contractors on the site to help us complete that maintenance work. And we are very proud that the men and women down at Clear Lake, we were able to send those guys back home, everyday safely, so that\u2019s a whole turnaround, that\u2019s a great accomplishment. And of course secondly to meet the commitments that we made to our customers as a leader in Acetyls business globally. And we are able to accomplish that despite the turnaround by a variety of sourcing arrangements and moving of molecules around our systems. So, Mark mentioned, swaps, so we had agreements to co-producers to provide us some products. We actually even uneconomically had to move products out of China and out of Singapore to meet our commitments in the West. So, one of the reasons we talk about this $30 million impact in the second quarter, is related to that commitment to meet our customers' needs, and we were able to get through that without incident. So, that\u2019s really it what sets us up for the improvement as we go in the third quarter, because we just won't -- not only we will not have work going on at Clear Lake, we won't have the inefficiencies of the needs to move those molecules around to meet market requirements. Robert Koort : And Chris, could you tell us what the tax assumption is for second half earning? Chris Jensen : Yes, right now, we are assuming it will be the same as what we were using today, which the way we do quarters, it's -- the rate used in the quarters to regular expect for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Frank Mitsch : So just to be clear, so following this result of 106 million in AI in Q2 you are expecting continued improvement in Q3. Is that correct off to that number? Mark Rohr : You got it, Frank. Frank Mitsch : And I thought I'd read -- this was last night, I thought I read that you thought a negative impact of the Clear Lake turnaround was close to 30 million, is that right? Mark Rohr : Yes, that\u2019s right. I mean the direct is 15 and indirect as Pat talked about the inefficiencies in our system. You can -- and some of that far to net, net of exactly, but so you call another 15 for that. Frank Mitsch : Alright, so that result in Q2 was constrained by that amount. Alright, terrific. And obviously AEM, nice results there on the -- how would you compare and contrast the organic growth of Celanese relative to the M&A you did? What's the growth been like, if you can parse it out between those two? Mark Rohr : Scott, would you mind jump-in on that. Scott Sutton : Yes, sure. Frank, if you think about what we did in Q2, I mean for the broad performance, we have M&A contributed, organic growth contributed. Organic growth is still contributed much more than M&A, certainly even more than our affiliates did. So, if I had to break it out to give you just a good view of it, and you look at organic volume growth, again Q2 '17 versus Q2 '16 was about 10% organic volume growth. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. And sir, your line is open. P.J. Juvekar: You guys have done a great job in the AEM business, it's become an envy in the chemical industry. So, what drives this success? Can you talk about your $75 million of R&D, corporate R&D? How much of that goes into this division and how much of that goes towards new product versus say application R&D? Mark Rohr : Yes, P.J., this is Mark. Well, let me back on this how about the success with the high low for just a minute, and Scott probably would watch the wedding on this as well. What I would say, we\u2019ve done extremely well as we\u2019ve really married the technology and commerce with our customers. So, we look at that having sort of multiple people in that box that are making decisions on a real-time basis when we pursue. And we have a lot of flexibility within our technology and sales groups to make sure that we are putting all the resources that accompany behind delivering on those things we say we are going to do P.J. So imagine the full force and the weight of selling these whenever we commit to the project A, B or C for our Ford or whoever we are working with, then we get it done right now. And so I think that\u2019s the power, the inherent power, the model. From a technology point of view, most of our technology goes into in the AEM, mostly spinning the floor behind and it's largely developmental spending. So, I think if you use the industry standards, 85.15 or 90.10, there\u2019s a small portion that\u2019s going in futuristic work, but most of it is addressing contemporary things before us. Scott, do you want to add something to that or? Scott Sutton : Yes, Mark I mean the only thing I would add to all that, permanently correct. I would just say that P.J., our go-to-market strategy is quite differentiated and we are really able to drag a lot of complexity out of customers and handle all these projects and find solutions that they might not otherwise be able to find, and certainly can\u2019t find from a single supplier, and move that complexity to our side of the house and manage it well, and that really is the competitive advantage. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And after acetate goes into this JV with Blackstone, what is the long-term future of the acetate into immediate business, Mark? And would you be looking to do a similar back the efficient deal in the future, if an opportunity comes? Mark Rohr : Yes, that quite answers of your first question. I mean I think when we look at putting these two businesses together, P.J., what we really will have in place is we will have a business that can really focus on the tremendous amount of changes underway in the tow industry, much of which is promoting the use of more sophisticated tow materials of cellulose acetate material as well as new technology out there to find uses for cellulose acetate, some of which we -- we're pretty excited about. And I think our partners Blackstone also have something to be excited about, so that marriage of those things gives us a chance to create truly a sustainable business model. Out of that, we expect that model to continue to contribute earnings to Celanese and we expect to continue to see high levels of free cash flow generation. And in some time, we think it will be a standalone entity that will have all the strength and power that should have in a standalone entity. What we do that again? Sure. I mean I think it\u2019s -- we already feel like we have got -- we have three number one businesses as we like to say. And if there\u2019s a way in the chain business, we could bring in other assets of businesses and find ways to key it up to grow with the kind of pace we expect it to grow. We'd absolutely do that. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Duffy Fischer : Two quick questions. One for Scott, on that 10% organic growth, the incremental margins on that, is that keeping pace with segment average? Scott Sutton : Yes, hi Duffy and it is. I mean if you boil it down and you take out affiliates and you take out M&A, you would actually find that our margin in Q2 of '17 is a little bit better than our underlying margin in Q2 of '16. So, it's absolutely keeping pace. Duffy Fischer : And then just a second one, on the commodity side of the acidic. How do you guys see the cycle today, I mean, it's been a long time that we have been at a relative trough? Next three years, is there a chance that we can start getting some tighter operating rates and actually start to see a cycle in acidic acid? Scott Sutton : Now, Duffy, you know we don\u2019t talk about the business as the commodity business. Duffy Fischer : There are some commodity parts probably not yours. Mark Rohr : Yes, as I have always said, China, we know, China is structurally over supplied in such a large way. So I'm not going to tell you, you are going to have this global tightening. And what we have to do to manage between the differentiations that we have in our cost structure between the three acid units around the world, and tie those together in a way in which we can capture a value as it presents to itself quickly. And that\u2019s how we have to do it Duffy. I am not going to tell you that demand is going to certainly overcome or the supply coming out of China. It's not going to unfold that way. We are working hard in China to try and to drive conversations and outcomes that might put the supply side in a more sustainable position. But that also is a complicated process given the nature of China. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. David Begleiter : Mark and Pat on the same issue on China. I see you just announced some price increases earlier I guess last week in China. Is that a sign of any underlying strength in the Chinese market or maybe you can comment on the reasons for that Chinese price increase in acid deals? Mark Rohr : Yes, thanks. It's really building out the comment I just made being quick. There is some interesting things going on inside China today that presented an opportunity for us to drive some value. And on the VAM business for instance and I talked last quarter about the implication of high ethylene price on our ability to compete versus the carbide suppliers in the first quarter and how we backed away from the market. That situation did reverse as we got into the second quarter. It allowed us to reengage with the market. As we sit today in addition to that competitiveness, we also see some supply outages. You got a lot of rain in central China that's driving difficulty getting product down the Yanji and to the coastal market, that\u2019s providing an opportunity for us to drive value as well. And as those opportunities present themselves, we will really jump on it. And I would say similarly with acid where we're monitoring kind of what the supply dynamics are and when we will see something, we are going to jump on it. It may not last -- it may not last to quarter, it may not last to month, but as it last we are going to go grab it. David Begleiter : And Scott just in your business, how do you stand in the dynamic of price versus was raw in your business is AEM? Scott Sutton : David, I mean, we are raising price in some specific areas and having some success at doing that. I mean you know go back to my earlier comment that there was actually a little bit of margin expansion taken out of M&A and affiliates and so forth. But I mean we are able to do that and we specifically been successful at raising price in China on some of our larger products. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison from KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Sison : In AEM, you talked about margins being lower year-over-year largely from acquisitions. Was there any squeeze from raw materials or were you able to kind of offset those with pricing? Scott Sutton : Yes, so Mike and this is Scott. We do have that margin decline when you drove in all the M&A, that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve reduced it some. There is a little bit of margin squeeze going on, but we have been successful at raising price in certain areas particularly in China preference to previous comment. So, I mean we are able to come back that and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a squeeze in the underlying business. Mike Sison : Okay, great. And then Mark just in general acquisition for AEM. How is the pipeline, any particular areas in the plastics rope that you see exciting now going forward and maybe given the balance sheet position, any opportunities to look at something bigger? Mark Rohr : Well, let me start with the background there. We feel pretty good about the pipeline. I will say that, that we thought that we had a couple of deals we are working and pulled away from is again, no reason other than the ownership is to elect not to sell. This sets us back just a little bit, but we have a number of indicative offers out that out there now that we are discussing to try to see close on some deals here. So, we are working that hard as we said, and you know Mike, we have made the comment that we need to -- there needs to be a continuation for us I think to continue to expand our business profile and market reach and access, so we can imply our sales to keep this growth going. So, we are working hard. We feel pretty good about the pipeline. And that\u2019s really helped be in position to announce something we just can\u2019t quite do that now. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : When you described your acetate tow joint venture with Blackstone, you talked about it being accretive by $0.50 or $0.75 a share a few years down the road. Did those accretions calculation assume that there are no divestitures? Mark Rohr : Yes, they assume no divestitures. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And second, your AI business did really nicely on a sequential basis maybe in EBITDA you are up 23 million. Can you talk about whether that came from Europe or the United States or Asia and/or what the weight for sequentially? And was it more of a VAM phenomenal or acid phenomenal, can you give us some color? Mark Rohr : Well, we did here just a little bit. I mean our business predominantly from a profit value point of view is on our just side be Atlantic. So, generically speaking, that\u2019s where the really value equation is driven. So, it\u2019s almost always a case. We\u2019re seeing the biggest uplift in that area. Pat, you want to comment just broadly directionally on how you saw that unfold? Pat Quarles : Sure, yes. Jeff, I think acid and VAM both went in the right direction obviously to get that result almost equally, globally. Mark is right of course, we do made most of our money in the west. We did have a change in the circumstance for VAM specifically 1Q to 2Q, which I have mentioned earlier right. So, we did reenter and versus second quarter we did better in VAM than we did in the prior quarter. That was a sequential kind of a differential market driven improvement. Otherwise, I would say you just had that environment because of what we were doing in the market and impact to the outages that allowed general market inflation throughout. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Laurence Alexander : Just want to follow up on the discussion about the competitive dynamics in China and the degree to which they are being -- disciplined being forced on them by weather related issues. In the past you have suggested that there may have been an emerging trend of better just competitor disciplined in the region. Are you still seeing that or is that reversing? Mark Rohr : Yes, I'm not sure I am okay drive that is supplier disciplined. I think the conversation we have had before was there were indications that these units that are kind of structurally impaired to use the technical term because they're just oversupplied in the challenges we all see in margin is leading people to consider option for rationalization or consolidation. But it's just hard to get that done in China, but it\u2019s a start, right. If guys have social obligations beyond just financial, it's different than the way we think. And so they have to work these things through. So that\u2019s what I was speaking to during the last call. And I would say those things still exists, it's just a process. And kind of here and now, the weather impact and so forth is that -- I would say that just as very reflective of the nature of our business that it hinges on people's ability to continuously run and meet market demand and the changing economics that happened inside China and our ability to manage our system around it to capitalize on that volatility. Laurence Alexander : And then secondly just on the increased number of projects that you are running. Is the average size of the project -- is it shrinking? Scott Sutton : Lawrence, this is Scott. The average size really isn\u2019t coming down that much, but what I will say is that with the acquisitions you do find that they have an initial smaller size project going into there. So, it's possible that the number comes down for a while, right. But then we get the cross synergies we pick up other projects, so it's sort of a temporary phenomenon, it's not a major concern. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead with your question. John Roberts : Your implied back half guidance doesn\u2019t seem to be all that different from were consensuses. Was it the start of the year, in spite of having a pretty good first quarter and second quarter? Or is there a key risk that you want to highlight for the second half of the year? Mark Rohr : Well, I think I've gotten since up from what we have been saying, there mathematically, John, you are probably, right. But we think we are promoting to pushing up our guidance and our earnings in the second half of the year, which is what our original premise was, more robust outage as you may recall there. Key risk to I think really when you push in this kind of level with earnings, it's that business gets weak in the fourth quarter for some reason, we can't predict. That\u2019s, I mean, that\u2019s always a risk when you get into this from a trend point of view, that 9% to 11% we believe is fair. And we think -- from our point of view, we think that\u2019s an improvement we try to signal improvement than we were before. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Just a question on consumer specialties. You had a little bit of a downtick there. What\u2019s the new outlook for the remainder of the year and next year? Have you found potentially a base line there? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yes, Arun, we believe where we are now is roughly a baseline and of course we went through it as we had advertised that step down, it was going to occur in the second quarter so you have seen that. We will continually work to try to tune that up a bit by ways we can impact those earnings, and we\u2019ll need to a little bit to be flat year-over-year. But we expect that run rate that you're seeing now as those good numbers ending to run out through this year. Arun Viswanathan : And then as a follow-up I mean methanol cost potentially could be coming down in the second half. It\u2019s already come down a little bit. How does that affect your ability to go out and get price in some of the derivatives? And what gives you the confidence that [IAL] will continue to go up in that environment? Thanks. Pat Quarles : Yes, this is Pat. I think the way fair price methanol is that\u2019s going to be volatile and it\u2019s very difficult particularly in the second half of the year to have a strong outlook in which way it\u2019s going. If I appreciate, it's right. We\u2019ve been talking about MTO coming on stream in China on the coast buying 3 million to 4 million tons a year of new methanol demand. And that\u2019s kind of matched against their ethylene and polyethylene alternatives. And with the way now it's coming, you have got coast. You know, candidly, I think it\u2019s just a question mark as to how that plays through in the coming months. One thing we would anticipate is just the volatility piece of it. So, we have positioned ourselves on both sides of it to be prepared to drive either operationally or pricing margin-wise to get the best out of -- out of that volatility that we can. It\u2019s going to be somewhat interesting to watch in these coming months as to how these dynamics play out. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Please go ahead with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Mark, you talked a bit about the margin erosion on the AEM side of things and obviously not surprisingly it\u2019s coming on the back of some of these acquisitions that you have made. My question basically is that again in your prepared remarks you talked about recovering some of that margin erosion from synergies. So, I am just trying to figure out where we\u2019ll end up in terms of run rate margins, once those synergies are captured? Should we think mid 30s, high 30s, mid even back to 40% plus levels? Mark Rohr : Well, with what several 100 basis points from a dilutive effect of this which it will come into portfolio, we were very open about that process. These companies we are buying have margin levels of roughly half of ours. So our strategy is to oversee the times to get those levels up to our existing levels. So, you expect, if we did any other acquisitions relatively push that margin back up over some period of time. If on the other hand, we are continuing to roll in acquisitions like this on annualized basis, I think you are going to see numbers more like where we are now. In other words, if there\u2019s always a dilutive impact on a new term basis that we haven\u2019t recovered, you won\u2019t be able to push it out. So, I think somewhere between where we were and what we are today, is the long-term average for our company, but near term is going to be closer to this level. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, understood. And then as a follow-up, you\u2019ve talked about at least in the near term your expectations for some volatility in methanol pricing. As you look at your portfolio now, I know back in the day you talked potentially another methanol plant. But seeing some of this recent volatility, the influx of some of these MTO plant in the Lake, where do you guys stand now with regards to your global position in methanol? Would you sort of consider another methanol plant particularly as your cash flow continuous to improve? Mark Rohr : Well, I think it's not -- it's not a top of our list where we'd like to invest our money today. We like high methanol prices, but we also like methanol volatility and we think certainly the coastal MTO facilities out there created the helm of that volatility. So net, net that\u2019s good for us. So right now, we are not taking our position on that, we are just watching that market and continue to consider it. If there were to be another investment, we will probably watch our company to do it, but right now it's not very high on our list. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim Sheehan from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead with your question. JimSheehan: Can you talk about the process with the JV? Are you referenced that you are preparing to carve some assets out in preparation for that joint venture and making your contribution to it? How long do you think that process might take? And can you give ballpark for when you think that deal might close? Mark Rohr : I think, Jim, we understand with given some specific dates, we're just really getting started in this process. So, I think if you'll be a little bit patient, we will share more of that probably in October timeframe after we're fully in it and have the ability to maybe to get a sense of the pace people are working out and things like that. The carve out process is just some of the many things we have got to do to prepare our assets, I mean, to compare ourselves as this transfer our assets into the new JV. So that process is a multi-month process and it will probably take us to the end of this year or next to complete. Chris Jensen : Hey, Jim, this is Chris. Let me just add to that. When we said carve out in this particular transaction, this is not complicated from a physical asset separation perspective. We are really talking about systems processes and legal entity and tax structures. Jim Sheehan : And could you give us an update on your thoughts on portfolio management? There is a lot of global assets for sale, under what circumstances might you consider some transformational M&A? And in the context to that, do you consider the Acetyl Chain core to your business? Mark Rohr : I am sorry can you ask that one more time. Jim Sheehan : Sure, Mark, I'm just wondering if you could update us on your thoughts on the portfolio in terms of whether you will consider larger M&A transformational deals, whether you will consider breaking up the Company? Is Acetyl Chain something that you considered to be core or would you consider different structure to create shareholder value? Mark Rohr : Well, like we said outline, our purpose here is to create shareholder value, so we don\u2019t look at ourselves as being constrained in any way to do that. We also said we are not going to do anything that\u2019s coactively stupid or anything that destroy shareholder value. So, if you look at the deal we just did, as a sad part of that if selling these taken a position to sell that assets, let's say, the net of that probably would have been about the level of this dividend that we received. So, we've structured the deal in a way that's going to have a tremendous shareholder value creation as a result of it net, net. And you are taking what was already arguably one of the best, if not the best cellulose acetate business in the world, and you're making it even better by combining those two great businesses. So that kind of structure, would we do that again and again? Sure we would. It\u2019s not easy to do but we certainly would. We believe that Materials is best-in-class in terms of the solution base formulas that we have. We have more bandwidth on our molecules than anyone else in that space and we have ways to continue to grow that. We would like to do a bigger deal in that space absolutely if do we find one to fit. If you look at the chain business, the chain business is awesome. At a time where no one can look at the industry metrics and believe you are able to generate this kind of margin off of that business, we continue to do it because of the unique nature and differentiated nature of that business. There are also ways we can expand that. So I think what you're happier selling these as you have a leadership team that\u2019s fully driven to create shareholder value, and we don\u2019t feel like we have constrained anywhere to do that. But we don\u2019t want to do just bust down for the sake of buying it nor sell something just for the sake of doing it. It\u2019s got to really translate in incremental shareholder value or we can\u2019t do it. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Vincent Andrews : Even more specific follow-up on this line of question. Mark, you've referenced you said last year I think at a conference said, if you were to separate the business unit, there would be it think a $125 million to $150 million of biz synergies specifically from raw materials and logistics. And you went onto say that the tax implications would be more substantial, which I took to mean more than 125 to 150. So could you just update us, if those are the right numbers to think about and what the tax complexity be, maybe in a range as well? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yes, so we continue to work on pulling those numbers down a bit. But on a gross level, the way I would look at it is, it has a negative present value somewhere between $1 billion and $1.4 billion, if you look at it from an impact to cash flow kind of basis. And, Chris, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything more to that? Chris Jensen : Yes, Vincent, I would tell you the number Mark just threw out there and what we have talked about on run rate basis does include tax impacts. And we have done a lot of work over the last couple of years to actually minimize what those otherwise would be. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And Chris just a follow-up for you, I think your free cash flow guidance I think before was at least 850 and now I guess around 850 CapEx is the same. So is there a working capital issue or cash taxes or what\u2019s creating that? Chris Jensen : Our intention was not to signal if any difference than where we were last quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Good morning thank you. You provided overall profit guidance for the consumer business. Could you give us some thoughts separately on your outlook for pricing and volume? Do you have any visibility on either one of these components? Chris Jensen : Yes, in terms of what business please? Aleksey Yefremov : As our filter tow business. Chris Jensen : Well, I mean look as Mark said, right, we think that there is a base line that we sort of hit and you should see that going forwards. So there is likely to be fairly consistent volumes going forward a little bit of potential price degradation that we are able to offset here going forward. It is still a really competitive industry. But net, net earnings sort of stabilizing Aleksey Yefremov : And question for Pat on methanol. I know you mentioned your prior view of tightening methanol market the essential projects. Why did that tightness not happen? And what is your I guess longer term view you mentioned also more volatility in the near term, do you think as we look out next 12, 24 months, do we still have a tight market or somewhere in the balanced region? Pat Quarles : I think we made from what we are anticipating. We are absolutely seeing the new demand coming. I mentioned about 4 million tons in new demand associated with MTO on the China coast. So that is they are structurally. But the volatility dynamic now is the choices that they make economically between their ethylene and by ethylene alternatives. So that\u2019s why structurally I think the market is in a better place than it used to be. And yes the volatility is going to be the principal driver because we have so much demand now tied to basically the ethylene or C2 chain versus just a straight Q1 chain. And that\u2019s a new dynamic for this business. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi form Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Mehul Dalia : This is actually Mehul Dalia sitting in from Ghansham, how are you doing. In AEM, you are increasing the number of projects to 2017. Is that particularly due to the cost pollination from recent acquisitions? Or is there any particular end market that is perhaps doing better from an adoption standpoint than you thought initially? Scott Sutton : This is Scott. Look, I mean, it's really not about a specific end market, right. As an example Q2, right, we grew business in every single end market, it's more about improving the business model, getting more out of the organic business, continuing to enhance the acquisitions that we made, so it's very broad base. It's the best way I can answer that question. Mehul Dalia : In previous calls you have given some parameters for AEM in 2012 in terms of EPS contribution year-over-year. Can you give us any update on that, if there is any? Scott Sutton : So, this is Scott again. It's really not a significant change to the guidance we gave before, but what we will say is that we are operating out on the ins of those. You see Acetyl is certainly pushing the upper limited and will -- engineered materials will push the upper limit like we are working hard to keep tow within the guidance we gave you before. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Kevin McCarthy : My question relates to Ibn Sina. I think you are in testing phase there on the incremental POM capacity in the second week of June. Have you transitioned to commercial production? And related to that, would you give us an update on the likely timing of the step up in your ownership interest to 32.5% please? Scott Sutton : Sure, Kevin. This is Scott. Yes, we really moved beyond the testing phase. We are in commercial start up now. We have made some material. It's not fully running at commercial rate. So there is still little bit more work to do here in the third quarter. Well, I won't give a specific time on our equity interest step up that will be some time in the period of the fourth quarter just too contractual lag effects that happens. There is still some milestones to go with getting fully in commercial production at POM. Kevin McCarthy : Great. And then with regard to your AEM segment as a whole. What your stand on end used market mix particularly automotive mix in the wake of your two acquisitions? And maybe you could speak more broadly about how you would expect end used market mix as well as geographic mix to evolve over the next year or two? Scott Sutton : Yes, so this is Scott, right. I will start with geographic question first. I mean we are growing Asia much more rapidly than we are growing the Americas and Europe, though the Americas and Europe are both growing. So one day that\u2019s going to mix out to sort of one-third, one-third, one-third, it\u2019s not quite there yet. In terms of the market segment, I mean auto is still our largest market segment but as we said before it\u2019s come down quite a lot. I mean you can think of it in the range of a third or just over. There are other segments that are growing more rapidly forth. We are growing in every single segment but if you look at energy storage, consumer products, and particularly medical, that\u2019s where we are seeing some of the higher growth rates. Mark Rohr : Yes, building on that. If you look at -- just a little bit on that, if you look at although, you\u2019ve seen numbers quarter-to-quarter 10% drop in Germany and yes we are still seeing our volume hold go up in those cases. So, we don\u2019t look at it as markets as much as with the applications and technology. That\u2019s how we persist. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, I am showing no additional questions. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Ms. Varshney for any closing remarks. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Jamie. And thanks everybody for your questions and for listening in this morning. We will be around, if you have any further questions after the call. Jamie, I will turn the call back to you now. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that we will conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

And welcome to the Celanese's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only-mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation Third Quarter 2017 earnings conference call. My name is Surabhi Varshney and with me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer; Chris Jensen, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer. Celanese Corporation's third quarter 2017 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market closed. The slides and all prepared comments for the quarter were also posted on our website www.celanese.com in the Investor Relations section.  As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentations may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, Celanese Corporation's future objectives and results. Please note the cautionary language contained in our posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and are on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information.  The earnings release and the non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on a Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then open-up for your questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark now. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Surabhi, and welcome to everyone. We posted our prepared remarks along with earnings yesterday. So I'll limit my comments and then open the line for questions. Starting with Hurricane Harvey, all three of our Texas sites, Clear Lake, Bay City and Bishop directly affected by the storm. All units were quickly restarted, but logistics disruptions proved to be a challenge. We estimate $11 million in direct expenses and another $20 million to $30 million in loss profit opportunity as a result of the hurricane and flooding. It took extraordinary supply chain and commercial actions to overcome these headwinds. And we are very proud of our teams who worked tirelessly to overcome this disaster and to deliver strong results this quarter.  Regarding the tow venture with Blackstone, we have filed for regulatory approval in all six jurisdictions and have already received approval in Mexico. We anticipate that the European Commission will continue to assess the tow JV over the coming months with a final decision potentially in late spring of 2018. For consolidated results in the quarter, 2017 GAAP earnings were $1.68 per share with adjusted earnings of $1.93 per share. Record adjusted earnings per share came in at 16% above the level last year despite the hurricane. We also returned $260 million of cash to investors of which $200 million went to share repurchase and $62 million to dividends. The Acetyl Chain core income of $157 million in the third quarter improved 44% year-over-year on sales of $863 million. We were positioned for an improvement and environment for the Acetyl's business in the second half of the year and solid uplift occurring before the storm. Segment income margin for the Acetyl intermediates was an all-time high this quarter of 19.6%, primarily driven by acetic acid pricing in Asia. Material Solutions showed record net sales of $730 million in the third quarter. Segment income in AEM increased 16% year-over-year to $147 million on net sales of $543 million both records. In the quarter, we commercialized 585 projects, which set us to up to deliver more than 2,100 projects for the full year. In Consumer Specialties, segment income in the third quarter was $79 million with segment income margin of 42%. Tow price and volume decline in the quarter versus the third quarter of 2016 due to lower industry utilization rates that we\u2019ve previously discussed. Affiliate earnings in material solutions were $71 million for the quarter, up 18% year-over-year. Now taking our first look at next year, in AEM we expect new project commercializations, M&A and base business volume growth net of the planned site turnarounds to add $0.50 to $0.60 to adjusted earnings per share in 2018. In the Acetyls Chain, we expect commercial momentum to create additional value uplift of $0.35 to $0.45 of earnings per share. Along with other growth related cost in the range of $0.15, we contemplate year-over-year adjusted earnings growth in the range of 9% to 13% in 2018. We'll provide a more detailed look and updated view of 2018 earnings during the January call. Closing out the year, we expect the sustained improvements in the Acetyl\u2019s Chain and materials core to continue. Offset a bit by typical fourth quarter seasonality. Considering these factors, we are confident in our ability to end the year at the end of our 9% to 11% range for 2017. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. I'd like to request all callers to please limit to one question and a follow-up. Denise, please open the line for questions now. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning will be from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Thank you, good morning. I was just wondering, in your commentary you mentioned M&A still being a component of the AEM growth. Can you give us some sense of scale of assets or properties you're looking at and how much might be baked into that guidance for next year? Mark Rohr : Yes, well there is nothing new baked into the guidance beyond what we currently have in the accretion of the current acquisitions that we've done. And I carry folks back to the Investor Day we had a few years ago where we put forth this objective of 8 to 8.50 in that the difference between 8 and the 8.50 was the incremental M&A, using $100 million of M&A profit. And of course there was $100 million more tow in that number. So we really on a corrective basis are more like 7.50 in that. So what I would say is that to push on to the 8.50 number we probably need some additional M&A to help us close that gap. What we\u2019re looking for in scope I think we're not limiting ourselves to just bolt-ons, but Bob that's where most of our activity is these days as continue to look forward in finding and we hope having soon more bolt-on properties. Robert Koort : And would you expect those deals to continue to be -- I don't want to call it niche, but less of the high volume lower price stuff and more of the high price lower volume stuff. Or is it do you have the potential and obviously you gotten into that line of business little bit could you be looking at some higher volumes engineering resins? Mark Rohr : Yes. Robert Koort : Got it, thank you. Mark Rohr : And I think directionally we're practicing this process, the team is getting very good at it, we've approached a few deals as you\u2019ve suggested there maybe it's not worked out for us, but yes that scenario for us that we continue to look at. Robert Koort : Great, thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning fellows. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Question obviously terrific growth in AEM, first time in a while it looks like you're having to put some meaningful capital with expansions, how should we think about the incremental returns on that capital, how much will it cost to keep growing kind of at the rate we've seen in the last couple of years? Chris Jensen : Hi Duffy, it's Chris. Typically our organic growth capital was the highest returning investment that we have higher than M&A. So if you conservatively put our cost of capital at 10%, it's far in excess of that. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then on the segment EPS increase that you talked about, is that using a like-on-like share count or is that assuming some benefit from the share buyback when we think about that rolling through the segments? Chris Jensen : So I think we've said in the prepared remarks that sort of the below the business stuff is an incremental of $0.15. So that net of some benefit of share repurchases, but not new share repurchases, rather the rollover of some of the share repurchases that we did in 2017. Duffy Fischer : Terrific, thanks guys. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Duffy. Operator : The next question will come from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, Mark. Can you discuss the acetic acid market right now, how it's progressing for the year and specifically what's happening in China from your perspective? Mark Rohr : Yes, I'll make a few comments and ask Scott actually to weigh in here, but we started out this year and we gave our projections for the year. The first our range, we're very careful to know to everyone that we anticipated, expected based on what we saw the business to improve as we went through the year. And so we've taken steps early and we're prepared for that and in fact we saw this, so we have seen an improving trends in this business, particularly in China, and that's prompted, it allowed us really to take advantage of our global supply chain and the systems that we have in place to differentiate it. Scott you want to provide maybe more local color on China. Scott Sutton : Yes, I will, and David, I mean, China is an improving environment in acetyls and it's particularly improving in acidic acid which really drives acetyls in China which drives acetyls globally as well. I mean, one of the reasons that it's improving is I mean China is having to run more in a real business environment, right, you see regulatory things come in, you see environmental things come in you see a drive for profit and all of those things are driving up instantaneous capacity utilization of acid, right that's different, the nameplate capacity utilization. But it's running at a much more comfortable level and that gives us the ability to apply our model quickly and you see that result coming through and we expect it to continue. David Begleiter : Mark you\u2019ve discussed in the past perhaps doing an Acetyl like transaction with acetyls acidic acid, how is the potential looking for 2018? Mark Rohr : Well, I mean, that's been awful specific on day, so I think we're working hard to -- with all of our businesses which we think each one leads the world in its own way. We're looking hard to find ways to continue to sure up and monetize those in a way that is additive to [ph] our shareholders. So what I would say is that we're working that equation, but I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to put a date on it. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Frank Mitsch of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Yes, hi good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Mark, two weeks ago one of your competitor suffered an outage, can you talk about how that has impacted your business over the past couple of weeks and what the outlook would be? Mark Rohr : Well, I\u2019d really -- yes there was an event, you guys are aware of the event and fortunately I think really got axed on it partner but it was hurt out of that event and the community wasn\u2019t impacted, so that's really positive thing. We haven't really seen that bigger impact of that it really is the function of how long that event last, and whether really rolls itself through the market in a big way I think is time will tell that. Frank Mitsch : Alright. What sort of lingering effects if any are you seeing from Harvey? You obviously size the impact in September. How should we think about that in Q4? Mark Rohr : Well, as we speak today, we're still trying to get barge traffic to Bay City. We have four dredges. I'm looking at Scott I think wind up outside the plant site trying to drudge a last few miles of the silted up Colorado River. We've been supplying that plant site with trucks and rails and mill trains and anything else that logistics team can get in place to give material down during the product out. So there is a cost, ongoing cost impact to that, we're able to run it fairly successfully though or we found our ways to run it fairly successfully. So I think largely the ripple effects are over from that storm. And I wouldn't anticipate losses this quarter, material losses this quarter as a result of it. Frank Mitsch : Alright, thank you so much. Operator : The next question will come from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Hi, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning P. J. P.J. Juvekar: Mark, you're introducing over 2,000 projects that's almost 10 projects a day, and you're going to 3,000 next year. So how much of these projects are cannibalizing existing products versus how much would you say new products like your Hammer Handle example. Mark Rohr : Well I don't think there is any cannibalization going on. I mean by definition it had to be new, so it's a new application or a new customer that we're going in and put an application into. So having said that there may be some substitution where a person is going from moving in a lateral way. So but largely I think it's their new. Scott would you agree with that? Scott Sutton : I mean all of those projects are new. I mean, it's true P.J. there is some attrition in the business right. As model changed and models go away, but very rarely do we have a new project that actually replaces something that we were already doing and that's called the project. I mean it's really new growth, which helps offset normal attrition that's going on in the business. Are we answering your question? P.J. Juvekar: Yes, that's good. And what is the typical margin uplift from these new products. And wondering why you didn't see a margin uplift actually margins declined. Whether that due to raw materials with the hurricanes? Scott Sutton : Yes, I mean as far as the margin slight decline that you see P.J. I mean we do have some impacts in this business from Harvey in the quarter. We lost some sales and have some cost there. But it is the M&A and the fact that we're selling heavily into Asia that's the real margin issue. I kind missed the first part of that question that you had though. Scott Sutton : I was asking for what is the typical margin uplift from these new products that you're introducing. Mark Rohr : Yes, margin uplift I got it. All the new projects coming at a quite a high contribution margin right, but on the other hand, we continue to support the growth for growth and that adds a bit of cost. And that's why we get back to this guidance that if you think about the base business including the acquisitions we do. So that's without affiliate earnings. An okay margin to think about there from an EBIT standpoint is around 20% trying to hold that level. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Operator : The next question will come from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I guess first, could you characterize what you're seeing in terms of year-end shutdowns or any noise you think about the bridge from Q4 to Q1 or how customers are behaving given the turbulence this year? Chris Jensen : Yes, I don't think Laurence anything unusual with that. We're coming off a pretty volatile quarter. And so I don't want to forecast exactly what's going on there, but typically folks tend to comp down a little bit as you get the holiday season and things tend to moderate a bit. But I'm not aware of -- I am looking it on the table I'm not aware of any big outage anyway that's really going to have a major impact on us one way or the other. Mark Rohr : And it's Mark. I would just say it's kind of your normal collection. I mean every quarter there is some and the Q4 is not going to be that different. Laurence Alexander : And then secondly on the trends in China, could you flash out a little bit you're thinking currently about the degree of demand pull for AEM in China and there is degree which need to build capacity specifically there to serve that market? Scott Sutton : Yes sure. So this is Scott again, I mean, look the demand pool in Asia, particularly in China is strong in our Engineered Materials business. I mean all market segments are up, in fact globally for us all market segments are up. But especially in China, you see good growth, in consumer you see -- we are starting to see some traction in medical there, the rest of the world as well. So it really is a combination of two things; one, there is great demand; number two, the China market is hungry for our model, where we can really go in and offer a whole bunch of unique solutions. And so I see that trend continuing. Laurence Alexander : Yes, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I had a question about your cash flow slide, in that what you say is to anticipate cash generation of $6.2 billion between 2016 and 2020, including the dividend of $1.6 billion from the JV. So if we subtract out the JV dividend of $1.6 billion, there is $4.6 billion left. So, is what you are saying that over a five year period, you\u2019re going to generate $4.6 billion in cash, or $920 million a year or is that a four year period, how do you do the calculation? Scott Sutton : Yes Jeff, it is five year. So if you think our current strategy period of 2018 to 2020 that we\u2019ll talk about early next year in our Investor Day. For that three year period this is $2.9 billion or $3 billion of free cash flow across three year. So you are about right on that average. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. And then for my follow-up, there is a Chinese initiative to have E10 nationwide in 2020. Is that something that would benefit Celanese or is it relevant to Celanese, as it actually enacted, or do you think it will be enacted? Scott Sutton : Yes, and so this is Scott, and you\u2019re right. It is actually, I think it\u2019s probably going to happen one year or earlier, that\u2019s the intention from China is to make that happen one year earlier, where 10% of all the cars sold are EVs right. And there is we see a big push there, I don\u2019t know that they will be completely successful to get to 10%, but it is a pretty dynamic change. And that kind of move is good for Celanese, because we offer a lot of solutions into the EV market, not just the car itself, because the car is our new that helps, but also the batteries as well, so it\u2019s a positive trend for us. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay great, thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : The next question will come from Mike Sison of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning nice quarter. Mark Rohr : Thanks Mike. Mike Sison : Mark when you think about AEM, the new project growth continues to be pretty impressive. Can you maybe talk about some of the markets particularly as you look to get to 3,000 next year? What are the areas that are looking to replace so the materials with polymers and you need to find new markets at this point, given you\u2019ve maybe saturated some of these areas? Mark Rohr : Well I don\u2019t know, we have saturated anything, but Mike there is just tremendous desire on the part of all manufacturers so consumer goods to continually evolve and update and make more contemporary of their goods, so that evolution is ongoing. What I will say is that medical continues to be a big area of focus for us, we put more attention there, we think there is a lot of opportunities in medical. So that\u2019s a growing segment for us. The Electronic segment that we have set up recently of course now lots of big player in electronic, we had been focused on as much as legacy Celanese and that\u2019s an area of real growth for us. Now let\u2019s say broadly in consumer applications, we gave an example in the handout that we did hammer handle I know it sounds somewhat a little bit low tech, but it\u2019s a pretty impressive opportunity to use some of our technology. And we are seeing lots of interest on players like that really to upgrade in many ways. Automotive remains important for us and we are demonstrating really strong growth in automotive in spite of global trends and that really is also one of that continual upgrade that we talked about earlier. So I would list those four as areas of real focus. Mike Sison : Okay. And then when you think about $0.50 to $0.60 EPS per share growth in AEM in \u201818 versus \u201817, is the turnarounds a big negative impact and then how much of that growth will come from the Ibn Sina production expansion? Mark Rohr : So we have -- we do have some turnarounds slated in materials next year that takes away from that tow volume. So absent those it could be another $0.05 to $0.10 higher I would think in there in the base business. So we've been seeing that contribution is -- we haven\u2019t said what that is, but it's not de minimis. Scott Sutton : Yes, it's not de minimis. This is Scott, I mean, I would tell you will see less of that we have been seeing a POM contribution through equity income and a little bit more that's in our base business because it basically supplies some of those products to our base business to go out and execute projects by. Mike Sison : Got it, thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thanks very much. Chris just on the working capital comments this year vis-\u00e0-vis your free cash flow targets, is that a new level of working capital based on the growth rate or some of the stuff that\u2019s just been reversed next year and help free cash flow next year? Chris Jensen : Yes, let me sort of take that in two pieces. So first, we're as you know we came out now and said look we're going to be towards the higher end of our guidance. We've had some nice growth across the business and along with that when it\u2019s the top-line growth comes and investment in working capital. The other thing that's driving that you heard Scott talk about strength in Asia and when our business is growing in Asia quickly as it is right now in acetyls and has been for a couple of years in engineered materials you're growing in a region of the world that typically has longer payment terms for accounts receivable. So that's why we've come out and said look working capital maybe a little higher than we thought. To answer the second part of your question, I think that continues on into 2018 provided that business stays strong in Asia and raw material price stay a little bit elevated if those things reverse, then yes your working capital would reverse. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then shockingly no one has asked about acetate tow yet, so I will. It sounds like you're expecting the segment to be flat next year, because your comment on where price negotiations are for the uncontracted portion of your volume. And then any thoughts or comments you have about the FDA\u2019s recent indication they would like to take nicotine out of cigarettes over some period of time. And what would impact that might have, I can see some good things and bad things from that for your business plan how it shakes out, so any thoughts would be great. Scott Sutton : Yes and so Vince this is Scott. Look as far as contract season and so forth, some part of that business is locked for another year or two, another part we've already been through negotiations on, there is a smaller part still yet to be finalized. And there is still a competitive nature in that industry, there is some price pressure, but generally speaking, I mean I think you\u2019ll see us come out with 2018 relatively flat compared to 2017. So it's really at this trough state. On your second -- the second question there, the FDA coming out with a proposal right to be move out nicotine. I think it's unknown how that will impact the industry, the reality is depending on the delivery system, the demand for cigarettes could either go up to get the same amount of nicotine or go down. So we really don't know. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Vince. Operator : The next question will be from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you, can you hear me? Mark Rohr : Yes, John. John Roberts : I\u2019d like to go back to Jeff\u2019s earlier question, which Scott I think you answered as an electric vehicle question in China, but I thought he had asked about, which is another announcement that China had back in September. And I would think if they\u2019re going to go coal based that\u2019s something you would know about, but it doesn't seem to make sense for them to go corn based given they imports. So do you have any thoughts on that announcement? Scott Sutton : Okay. Yes, okay sorry, I heard, EV, but I think he said E10, got it. Yes, on ethanol how will it go? Look that's kind of a no impact for us; we don't expect that to be material to us in either way. John Roberts : And then on the Celstran polyacetal in the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene expansions, with the capital required their scale off of past reactor capacities or is there anything that would make those more or less capital efficient projects for you? Scott Sutton : Yes, I mean, look as far as the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene part of that is incrementally expanding capacity and another part of that is a substantial additional system at a site where we already produce that. So you can think all of those expansions as being incremental. The other part of that the LFT part is effectively just another line at a site where we already produce it. John Roberts : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Question on capital deployment, you bought back $200 million of stock in the third quarter yet in your prepared remarks, I think you commented that you do not expect additional repurchases unless they're opportunistic or related to tow JV. So I was wondering if you could clarify some of the thinking around the opportunistic piece of that. And how you're weighing your options for capital deployment through year end? Chris Jensen : This is Chris; we're always looking for buying opportunities. But in general now that we've completed the $500 million of share repurchases that is what we set out to do this year. So that's likely the ending point for the year. I just don\u2019t want to ever say never and just depending on what kind of opportunities we have. The piece that's tie to the JV that really is repurchases that will be timed together with the proceeds that come from the day one dividend on that joint venture. Kevin McCarthy : Understood. And then as a follow-up, Mark, I was wondering if you could speak to the margin outlook in AEM. You've obviously had some mix effects related to your acquisitions. Perhaps you could elaborate on what's going on with the underlying margins and your efforts to raise the margins on the acquired properties. Mark Rohr : Well those businesses as we've said earlier were and to be honest most of the businesses we look at unfortunately have much lower margins than we do. So there is a process shift to go through to rebuild those margins to get them to our area. Two elements of that one is just pure productivity, which is certainly underway and that helps that also includes loading the assets up in some of the expansions that the team rolled out last week help us loaded these assets and dilute the cost associated with the operation on the third parties mix upgrade. And we're going through a process now of really upgrading the quality of the products that are produced in the -- by that and the marginal contribution quality of the products that are produced away from some of the low end products and in the products that are we can think -- we are consistent with selling these. So those three things are underway, I think we've said the 20% to 22% range is the range where we want to be in that process. We're a little bit lower than that this quarter. So I think you'll see us move back as we get into next year and start pushing that back up a little bit. And be mindful we had another deal or two you\u2019re going to see more down with pressure from that. But net-net we should be able -- that's a kind of target we have as we go through this acquisition period to be in that low 20s range. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect, thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Yes, sir. Operator : The next question will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning, thank you. Just had a question on the Acetyl\u2019s Chain. Maybe you can just help us understand the $0.35 to $0.45 growth for next year. What's kind of embedded on a pricing outside standpoint? Do you see do you expect some of the recent pricing to be sustained through next year? Scott Sutton : Yes sure Arun this is Scott. I mean we have momentum going into next year. So the biggest part of that $0.35 to $0.45 a share will be continued margin expansion. The other efforts we have underway have a little bit more to do with growth. So at the same time we'll be bringing in volume growth. Margin expansion in number one, number two will be some volume growth. Arun Viswanathan : And similarly on the tow side, what gives you guys the confidence that that will be neutral now after couple of years of declines? Scott Sutton : Well I think just our position with where we are in terms of knowing the outlook for next year already. Some contracts done some recently were being done right now a few more to do; we know we have a very good view of where we're going to be next year. There is still work to do there. We still have to have a little bit of productivity to get there, but we're working on that. So it's a decent view. Arun Viswanathan : And so if you were to roll it up, I mean, what would you say are some of the swing factors that would kind of push you towards the 13% projected growth for next year? Scott Sutton : Well I think organic comes back to hitting in all businesses. I think we have a lot of momentum in acetyls we can preserve that we have to see how long we can preserve it at the same level. Engineered materials you already see is stepping up our project outlook to be 3,000. And then we don't have this giant headwind on top of as like we have before with tow. So if you put all those things together and then things line out then we get to the -- closer to the upper end of that guidance. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Just wanted to sort of bring up the 2018 guidance again, back obviously in end 2015 you guys were guiding to long-term call it 2018 guidance of 8 to 8.50. If I do comparing contrast where we were in '15 relative to where we are right now obviously a couple of moving parts. It seems to me China seems to be a bit better, Europe seems to be a bit better, U.S. seems to be a bit better economy wise. But obviously back then maybe tow wasn't as bad as it looks today. So just want to figure out this sort of newer guidance that you're giving of call it 8.04 to 8.24, where the deltas were versus what you've guided to 8 to 8.50 back in end 2015? Mark Rohr : Well just first off, what we classically do this time of year to share our first look at next year. So I would call it a little bit short of annual guidance that is just the range as we look at our data today that rolls up. And we will give to the extent there is an official guidance we will give that in January for the year. Nonetheless when we look at it we rolled up the numbers we put forth that frankly I think we do believe we could do at 8 to 8.50 had a bunch of factors in there most predominantly was growing the materials business. And we were putting out numbers at that time of just starting to new project introductions and there was a lot of skepticism we could do that and I think the team has shown we have the ability to grow that quite handsomely and that has been one of the strongest stories of that three year period. I think the second piece to that was the Chain business, how we get the Chain business to move up from trough numbers in the low double-digit kind of range. And we gave a range I think a 12% to 16% earnings on that, we're starting to demonstrate and we will stay what we think the appropriate range is going forward next year. But we've shifted that up with a lot of activity and lot of things to numerous dimension over this call that it really stabilize our business a lot and give us more global reach with that business. So those two things were big, big factors in pushing it forward and gave us that concept to the range we were very clear that to do the high end of that 8 to 8.50 we need a material M&A, material. So you could translate that and say that we were thinking maybe $0.50 of M&A, which should be $100 million and of course currently we're maybe a third of that kind of levels where the deals that we've done. So if you want to deduct and you are to deduct that $0.30 off of that for that region alone. And then of course tow was not expected to be down from where we were it's actually expected to be flat to up. So that's another probably $0.50. So I think on a apples-to-apples basis it should be like 7.50 next year. So this is doing better. We're creating more value, and we're still are trying to do deals. So we're not walking out from anything we said in the past. But right now we see ourselves being kind of in the middle of it. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, very helpful. Now as a follow-up, obviously a bunch of moving parts around sort of naphtha, whether it's going to be sort of disbanded or certain amendment whatever the case maybe. And at least as I take a look at your sort of 2016 revenues call it 2% of sales from Canada, another 4% from Mexico. Just would love to hear your thoughts about any changes to naphtha or a disbanding of naphtha would that impact you guys at all? Mark Rohr : No. We've recently talked about that, we don't see any big impact positive or negative relative to that. I mean, I think the -- for us it really gets down to -- say it again, it\u2019s not how many vehicles were build, it\u2019s a fact that vehicles are being modified and upgraded continually and that\u2019s kind of the space that we played and to that effect we\u2019re showing very strong growth in that business, in spite of the fact that business is not growing or shrinking depending on which part of the world that you are in. So whether we build a bit more or less and Mexico doesn\u2019t really seem to matters to us or Canada, we don\u2019t care where they\u2019re built. Hassan Ahmed : I understood. Very helpful. Thanks so much, Mark. Surabhi Varshney : Denise, let\u2019s take one more question and it will be the last for the call. Operator : Thank you and that will be from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : Thanks. You have had a management departure in Acetyl Chain change, who\u2019s going to be running that business going forward and what\u2019s you\u2019re thinking on the planning and management there? Mark Rohr : Gentleman name Todd Elliot, you know Todd is running the commercial operations of the corporation for a long time, has been also growing our European operations and he has taken that role. Jim Sheehan : Great. And on the bridge to 2018 EPS, with respect to the tow JV, I think you initially indicated that there would be cost synergies that would be offsetting interest costs for that. And I think today you are framing it as interest costs are kind of being offset by the share buyback activity. If you could just reconcile that a little bit and are you assuming here a mid-year close for the JV, or what would be the timing for it to make the bridge work? Chris Jensen : Yes, just for planning purpose, we have talked about mid-year, just to make the math easier to do. We think there\u2019ll be a little bit of EBIT contribution from that there would be no EPS contribution on the annualized basis. Because the interest costs would be covered by share repurchases. So that\u2019s how we are -- so from an EPS point of view on the numbers this range we\u2019ve given you is really not in that.  The timing of that\u2019s pretty critical though and dependent on how it happens and how fast we got to market you could see a little bit of movement around intra year because of that. Scott Sutton : And synergies will eventually offset the costs of interest it\u2019s just there is a gap in the time. Chris Jensen : That\u2019s right. Jim Sheehan : Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : And at this time we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Surabhi Varshney, for her closing remarks. Surabhi Varshney : Thanks, Denise. We will wrap up the call now. Thank you everybody for your questions and for listening in this morning. We will be around, if you have any further questions after the call. Denise please close the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now ended. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. At this time you may disconnect your line.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Auston. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President-Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer; and Kevin Oliver, Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation's fourth quarter 2017 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. Slides and prepared remarks for the quarter were also posted on our website at www.celanese.com in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentation may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, our future objectives and plans. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and the reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our website in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on the Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory comments from Mark Rohr and then open up for your questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Mark now. Mark Rohr : Great, thanks, Surabhi, and welcome to everyone listening in today. Our prepared comments were shared with earnings yesterday, so I will kick off with a few comments and then take your questions. Let me first highlight our recent agreement to acquire Omni Plastics. Omni specializes in custom compounding of nylon and combining Omni with our Nilit and SO.F.TER acquisitions creates a global nylon franchise and increases nylon to 50% of AEM\u2019s net sales. We expect the acquisition to be EPS neutral for 2018 and contribute about $0.10 once synergies are achieved and we\u2019re looking forward to working alongside of very capable colleagues at Omni. Now to tow JV, we have received regulatory approval in four of the six jurisdictions. In Europe as part of the Commission Phase II review process, we received a statement of objections, which we look forward to address in the next few weeks. We strongly believe in the value created by the JV and then preparation have completed the creation of a new legal entity and operating structure for the cellulose derivative business. Turning to 2017 fully consolidated results, I am pleased to report GAAP earnings of $6.19 per share, and record adjusted earnings of $7.51 per share. The Acetyl Chain core income was $575 million, a 27% improvement over 2016. Core income margin of 17.1% exceeded a previous high in 2016 by 260 basis points. Our asset base that spans the globe combined with a unique commercial flexibility enabled us to respond swiftly to industry and market dynamics throughout the year. Materials Solutions generated core income of $900 million in 2017 and net sales of $2.9 billion, both records. Advanced Engineered Materials set new highs with segment income of $567 million, an expansion of $88 million over 2016 from growth in base business, new acquisitions, and higher affiliate earnings. AEM's segment income margin for 2017 was 27.1%, 610 basis points lower than the prior year mainly from margin dilutive acquisitions. Volume increased 46% in 2017 year-over-year, from growth in organic polymers and acquisitions. Consumer Specialties segment income was $333 million and declined year-over-year due to lower tow price and volume in 2017, which reflected lower demand and depressed utilization rates across the tow industry. Shifting to 2018, we are starting with strong momentum in the Acetyl Chain and expect a combination of our strategic and global footprint and a flexible supply chain to drive $0.35 to $0.45 of growth in adjusted earnings per share. In AEM, growth in both new and legacy polymers, along with increasing success in China partially offset by planned turnarounds puts adjusted earnings per share growth for AEM at about $0.50 to $0.60 per share. Consumer Specialties should be relatively flat versus 2017 and the tow JV should be neutral to earnings upon close. The recent Tax Cut and Jobs Act will have a positive impact on our adjusted tax rate in 2018 lowering it by approximately 2% to 14%. The tax benefit should offset investments and resources required to support our accelerated growth, which we estimated roughly $0.15 of earnings. All-in we are increasing earnings guidance per share in 2018 to 10% to 14% with the first half roughly 25% to 35% higher than the second and most of that difference occurring in the first quarter. Let me close by reminding you that our Investor Day is scheduled for May 1st of this year in New York, where we will outline our Strategy 3.0 and highlight growth plans and structural opportunities before us through 2020. Hope you can join us. With that, I will turn it over to Surabhi for your questions. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Auston, please open the lines for Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice end to the year there. Mark Rohr : Good morning Mike. Thank you. Mike Sison : Mark, in terms of AEM margins were squeezed a little bit. How do you think pricing is coming along to recoup some of that as you head into 2018? Mark Rohr : Yes, there has been a margin squeeze, as we talked about. Every business that we're buying is materially lower margin, and we've been pretty clear about the need to increase that. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, Mike, in addition to that squeeze from the dilutive aspects, we also got a little pinched on raws, and we were pinched a bit on unit operations. We had a number of unit operation issues throughout the quarter. So we expect to start recovering that as we enter the first quarter and from there. Scott, you want to add? Scott Sutton : Yes, I would just add that Mike even in the fourth quarter as well, we've done a lot of work in this business to dampen seasonality as well. Part of that dampening comes through selling more in Asia, so you see that impact also. The other thing, you might even see some of the press releases we've come out with pricing as well as we work to recover that moving into the first quarter because conditions are right to be able to do that. Mike Sison : And as follow up for AEM, I mean, volume growth has been really on a roll. Your new product generation programs have been great. What do you see as the opportunities for growth in 2018 for AEM? And maybe nylon sounds exciting, but are there any other areas or markets that you see opportunities for growth? Scott Sutton : Well this is Scott again. I mean, look, I would say every market that we operate in, in AEM, we're able to grow volume. I mean, we even grew volume in auto very nicely in the fourth quarter of 2017 because it is all about that model. We're a bit market-agnostic. So I mean, we're predicting that we'll be able to close 3,000 projects when you think about project-by-project growth, but we also still have a nice M&A pipeline that's at work for bolt-ons. Mike Sison : Great thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank Mike. Operator : Our next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, David. David Begleiter : Mark, in AI in the quarter, very strong results. How much do you think was influenced by the Eastman outage? Mark Rohr : Well don\u2019t have a real number on that. I mean, I think Eastman contributed a little bit to the momentum. But clearly, if you go back a bit, David, we actually, at the first year, we expected the market to tighten, especially in Asia, and we expected that shift to occur in methanol. And then it actually started before any of these outages you talked about. Actually, it started at the end of the third quarter there. So not \u2013 it was part of it but not a huge part. David Begleiter : And long term, you discussed maybe doing a JV with this business or, I guess, a tow-like transaction to take out some capital. Is that still an option or a possibility in the near to medium term? Mark Rohr : Yes, well absolutely. I think what we're really saying is that it's our expectation that the value equation received by our shareholders continues to go up. We think our company is woefully undervalued, and we have every intention to pushing it in a reasonable period of time to a $20 billion company. And so we are entertaining all options relative to doing that. So our belief system, though, is that the way to do that is to create stronger and stronger value equations. And if you've done that, then I think you can maybe do something separate with the business. So first, I would like to build it a bit more, to be honest, and have it be recognized for the real value it's contributing. And then, take another step and do something with it like the tow JV. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : Thanks, I think you guys have some pretty interesting windows into what's going on in China given your presence there. I know in your prepared remarks, you talked about the likely sustainability of some of these environmental efforts. I guess, I'm curious on a couple of points there. One, have you suffered at all from any of your downstream customers that have maybe been subject to some of these curtailments? And then secondly, can you give us any window on the volatility you might expect going forward from the MTO market and what influence that would have on your operations or profitability? Mark Rohr : So, what\u2019s interesting in China today Bob is, none of these policies or practices are new. The government has been promoting for a period of time, but there is now a connectivity between the municipalities and provinces to really these things happen. So it's reached a level of maturity in principle to drive real change. So that's the sort of the fundamental shift that we're now seeing in the region. So assets are being shut down and are, if they're continuing to operate at reinvestments, they have to then justify a stronger economic \u2013 a strong economic case for that. And they're struggling to do that. Unless they want to have scope or two, they really got the ability to move their business to a higher place. So all those things are structurally and fundamentally good. We have not directly suffered. We did have one company I'm thinking about in particular that did some work for us in the polymer business, was under shutdown orders, and we managed to work with them a bit and keep it operational until we could get our technology in place and our capability in place to replicate what they were doing. And now they're down, I believe. So I think there is some element of working with as the effectivity is occurring. At least in our case, it was. Yes, you're right on the MTO. One of the things we've seen, of course, the big MTO units are now up and running. And we're definitely at \u2013 I'm not sure what today's price is \u2013 at $1,400 a ton. There is margin even at $400 a ton methanol for these guys to do well. I do believe, though, this industry is one of \u2013 it's built in a way that can be turned on or off to match the \u2013 to deal with that arbitrage that exists between C1 and C2 chemistry. So we expect some volatility in the second half for this year, but it won't be sustained. So we do expect that. That's one of the reasons we've been a little bit cautious about forecasting continued \u2013 driving growth fully completely through the year on that chain. We'll know more as we get up and as we end the first quarter and get to the second. But I do expect volatility, but I think fundamentally, that's changed, Bob, so it's not going to go back like it did. Bob Koort : And just a quick follow-up. Any inspiration to build that second methanol plant given where margins are? Mark Rohr : We are very inspired. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys good morning. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that post Omni, nylon is roughly 15% of the AEM segment. Of the incremental project growth that you're seeing in AEM, can you just give us a sense as to how fast nylon has grown versus your other molecular platforms? Scott Sutton : Yes, this is Scott. I mean, it's not growing any faster. The whole product solution platform is growing fast across all of AEM-wide. It's Not disproportionate across the different polymers. Of course, our nylon business is growing just because of the acquisitions we've done, marrying up to some of the organic business that we had. But in general, the whole platform is growing quickly. Nothing is outpacing something else. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, thanks. And just my second question is on the tax rate and the 14% for 2018. Is that the right steady-state tax rate to think about for the company post the tax reform? Or is anything discrete to the year that may not repeat going forward? Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Yes, you\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s \u2013 and Kevin may want to give more color on this. But as you look at the tax laws that are \u2013 the clarifications being read out, we expect this to be a little bit lumpy in \u2013 over the next several years as we settle in exactly what those rates are. We think 14% is sustainable, but it could be plus or minus a percent or so as we go through the next several years. Kevin Oliver : Yes this is Kevin. I think that\u2019s a good response, Mark. We do think that rate is sustainable, but at the same time, yes, this is a significant change in tax law. You're going to continue to see IRS make some announcements in notifications, which they've done even just last week. So there could be some minor changes here or there, but we're not expecting a material impact. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Dan Rizzo : Hi guys this is Dan Rizzo on for Laurence. So if we look at the new project growth rate of the last few years, it's been pretty high. I was just wondering if we're getting to a point now where it has to naturally just kind of cool off a bit as we head into 2018, 2019? Scott Sutton : Yes, so this is Scott. I mean, no. I mean, the answer is no to that. I think we're going to project 3,000 closes here in 2018, and we'll lift that number again in 2019. I mean, we continue to refine the model to be able to handle more and more projects, but also have a higher batting average at the same time. So I expect that number to keep climbing. Dan Rizzo : Okay. And then \u2013 sorry? And then with your M&A, obviously, the focus is on AEM. But I was wondering if there are opportunities in other segments at all for \u2013 I don't know, potential bolt-ons or larger acquisitions. Mark Rohr : Yes we in the Chain business, there are some great opportunities to bring additional molecules into that portfolio. And we've been very active in that regard. We just haven't been able to quite pull them off yet. But you shouldn't be surprised to see investments in both cores as we take and try to extend these business models further. Dan Rizzo : Are expectations unrealistic in that area? Mark Rohr : Say that again, Dan I\u2019m sorry. Dan Rizzo : In the Acetyl Chain, are expectations in M&A too high or too \u2013 I mean, are people expecting too much in terms of price? Mark Rohr : No I don\u2019t think, I think \u2013 I think it\u2019s \u2013 no, the way we do deals is we go out and knock on doors, and so you just get rejected a lot in that process. So we're not looking for properties that are auctioned. We're trying to create the opportunity. So no, it's not really been a question of fit and willingness on the part of the person that you're asking to sell the properly. Dan Rizzo : Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Good morning, folks and nice to enter the year. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Frank. Frank Mitsch : Just a clarification on your \u2013 the tow approvals from China, Russia, Turkey and Mexico. Just to be clear, there is no remedies or contingencies that are part of those approvals, are there? Mark Rohr : No, no, they're approved. So we're waiting Korea and the European Commission. And really the focus is with the European Commission and going through that process. So yes. Frank Mitsch : Yes, you outlined nicely Phase 2 there, and we'll see what happens there. But \u2013 all right. Terrific. The guidance, obviously, roughly $0.40 improvement in 2018 versus 2017 on acetyls. You got about $0.20 upside relative to The Street in just Q4 alone. Could that be the area where if there \u2013 where \u2013 I don't want to use the term sandbagging or something like \u2013 that you might feel little bit better about being able to outperform in 2018 given where trends are and you guys are, et cetera? Mark Rohr : I think so. If you put a straight edge on the trend line, you've end up with a higher number. And all we're saying, though, is that there's been such a monumental change in China. You've got \u2013 and you've got a lot of good things going your way. You've got a lot of methanol out of the market, about six million annual tons out in the last quarter. That comes back on as we get into the end of the first quarter, start of the second. There's a new plant starting up here in the U.S., 1.8 million ton plant. And we're not sure exactly what ethanol play is going to be in China now. It's going to reflect back on MTO and methanol. I use methanol flow as indicator. And it's not so much our indicator, but it does move that market up and down a bit. So I think that it will be wrong to just continue that slope. But equally, I'm looking at Scott here. I think our feeling is that there's opportunity there, and we'll be able to communicate more about that after we get through the first quarter. Scott Sutton : Yes. I mean, Mark \u2013 I mean, I would just add that we continue to enhance our model and you're seeing the benefits of that as we drive this outcome. But also, that model has the opportunity to flex up and down a little bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on what kind of dynamics are out there. And there can be some cracks in those dynamics later in the year. As a result, you get some of that quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. But every single year, that business will be growing profitably. Frank Mitsch : Terrific. Thank you. Scott Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Mark Rohr : Hi P.J. P.J. Juvekar: On acetyls, you've done a great job of balancing the system to your advantage. Now what is the risk here? If China were to add more capacity in acetyls, will the landscape get disturbed? What risks are we talking about here with the system? Mark Rohr : Well, I mean, there's always theoretical risk, P.J. Really, practically speaking, China is not very desirous of overinvesting in big chemistry these days, so you're not seeing a lot of that. I mean, you're seeing some technical investments, which what I'd call MTO, to bring on olefins capacity, blended olefins capacity. But to build more of these plants means you're building more coal gasification. It means you're adding cost in a system that, to be honest, is not global low cost. So they can't really export with the kind of fever that you like. So it's pretty hard for me to imagine that any bank is going to fund the kind of money it would take to really go and build a competitive business here. I don't see that at all. So I think the days of that for everybody, not just for Celanese, this year would kind of go on, and you're going to see what investments you see would be very responsible and very needed to fit local demand and/or unique chemistry that maybe can be exported. But I wouldn't think so, not in our Chain business. Scott? Scott Sutton : Yes. I agree. Look, I mean, fundamental dynamics, fundamental conditions in China are much better. I mean, think about it. Mark, as that continued to grow, there hasn't been a lot of acetyl capacity addition on top of that. The competitors that are there are having to run in more of a structured format in terms of environmental and economics as well. All those things come together and all that old discussion around nameplate capacity and utilization doesn't apply anymore. I mean, this industry is operated at a much better utilization rate now. And that's likely to be the case for many \u2013 a number of years going forward. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. So then you don't expect a whole lot of new acetyls capacity? Is that fair? Scott Sutton : Yes. I think that's fair. Yes, there will some selective ones, right? But there is growth in that marketplace. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And just quickly, my second question on your tax rate. It's gone from 21% in 2014 to 16%. And now with the new tax law, it goes down to 14%. Can you talk about the progression of your tax rate since 2014 and sort of what factors drove that? Thank you. Mark Rohr : Kevin, do you want to\u2026 Kevin Oliver : Yes, so this is Kevin. I think you see a lot of the growth we've had, has been foreign growth. You've seen changes in tax rates across the globe now in nearing what you see in the U.S. with increasing rates. So I think that has been a trend that with the profile of the growth of our business and where that\u2019s happened, that\u2019s been favorable to us. In the U.S., you saw a nice reduction in rate, 14% reduction in rate. We lost some deductions here in the U.S. as kind of a giveback, but it did have a nice net 2% benefit moving to 2018. Mark Rohr : Yes. So as we moved, P.J., to a European structure, we were, in many ways, a little bit ahead of this, I would say. And so the rate you saw, it sort of like has been now continued with the lowering of the rate in the U.S. structure. So you\u2019re moving more towards a European system than a historical U.S. system, and our trend line just follows that. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. In acetyls, you mentioned that you sourced the equivalent of a full plant for early in the year. Is that basically the market was a little loose early in the year and you took that volume \u2013 excess volume off the market to help tighten things and then just resold it at a profit later in the year? Scott Sutton : Okay. This is Scott. Yes, thanks for the question. I mean, we did source quite a lot, but there\u2019s really a number of reasons that, that goes on. One, of course, we had a large turnaround earlier in the year; two, Hurricane Harvey impacted us in the Gulf Coast; but three, and the largest reason is that trading is part of our daily model. So we traded a couple hundred thousand tons last year, and we traded with more than 20 partners. And I would expect that to be a feature of our model going forward. It\u2019s not near as big as our self-production, but it is part of the model. John Roberts : And then back to the question on the antitrust review on cig tow. In Europe, are there any remedies in discussion yet? Or you\u2019re still expecting that you\u2019ll get approval in Europe without any remedies? Mark Rohr : No, we\u2019re going through a process of working with the objections in there, and we\u2019re not opposed to a remedy if it will be needed. I felt it was needed by the commission, but we haven\u2019t got to that point in the process. We think that stands on its own, and we\u2019re arguing that with the commission. But if we need a remedy, we think there is perhaps some options there. John Roberts : Okay, thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Duffy Fischer : Question with the new plant and the changes at Ibn Sina, of the growth this year kind of in your guidance, what percent is that? Mark Rohr : It\u2019s pretty modest for us. We are getting 1% step-up in Ibn Sina, which is in itself pretty handsome. If I just draw a circle around Ibn Sina, they have a couple of big site outages there that they\u2019re doing this year, which is a pretty negative impact. And so there\u2019s going to be a modest step-up there, I think, we tagged at another $10 million, which is less than half of the total step-up. Be mindful as well that when we have a new plant up and running, we\u2019re also bringing a lot of palm in the market, and there will be some ripple effect to that, and we\u2019ve got to deal with it. You\u2019ll see it, but you won\u2019t see quite as much stuff as the math would tell you would see. Duffy Fischer : Okay. You mentioned the new plant coming up in the U.S. with methanol. What\u2019s your view of the uranium plants that are due to come online this year? Chance? No chance? How would you kind of plug those into a supply-demand model? Mark Rohr : We think they\u2019ll come back. Duffy Fischer : Okay. Okay, good. All right, thank you guys. Mark Rohr : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. I apologize about that. There seems to be a good bit of distortion on Mr. Zekauskas\u2019 line. I\u2019ll see if I can get somebody to sort that out with him. We\u2019ll move on to the next for now. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First, a follow-up on the AI, sort of the trading component of it. Can you just help us understand what type of risk is involved in that type of activity? Are you able to hedge? Or are you just only taking on this sort of third-party volume when you \u2013 it\u2019s sort of more of an agency model or you already now serve the other end of the side of the trade? Mark Rohr : I think what we\u2019re doing, and Scott said it\u2019s a small portion of our total, is we have the ability to produce with any feedstock known to me and any location doesn\u2019t have it. And so when you look at that equation, that also means we can make decisions every day about buying and selling. And we can buy \u2013 where we might go up in volume, we can actually lower our own production rate and have something to fill it. So we participate in the market as a full player. So I think that \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s no more risk in that than the ongoing risk every day we have moving, producing and selling the millions of tons that we do. Vincent Andrews : Okay, good enough. And just a question on the Omni acquisition. Your prepared remarks mentioned they have some type of IP around working with recycled content, which is becoming a bigger issue, particularly in the EU. Can you give us a better sense of what it is that they have and how you can expand it? And do you need to invest in it? And how large do you think that opportunity is? Scott Sutton : Yes. I mean \u2013 this is Scott. I mean, Omni just has a nice part of their business whereby they start with, call it, post-consumer resin, and particularly nylon and polypropylene. And that\u2019s a part of the business that Celanese hasn\u2019t participated in historically in a very big way. So this is another new growth opportunity as we add it to our solutions portfolio. And they have some know-how and IP around that as well that we\u2019ll expand outside of just the U.S. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Dan DiCicco with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Dan DiCicco : Thanks. Just another one on acetyls. Given the recent strength, is it fair to assume a decent amount of input cost pressure could be coming in Q1 with the raws moving up? And then what kind of offsets here as the guidance you guys gave implies Q1 could be one of the stronger quarters this year? Mark Rohr : Well, I mean, there\u2019s always raw material volatility in that Chain business, but I don\u2019t think \u2013 I\u2019m looking at Scott. I don\u2019t think we see that being particularly onerous in the first quarter more than in any other quarter that\u2019s out there. So that\u2019s not really the issue. I think we feel pretty good about the first quarter. The question really is, will that floor stay quite as high as it pull back a little bit as we get later in the year for those reasons I mentioned earlier? Dan DiCicco : Got it. Yes. And just as a follow-up, still on the raws. You guys are still expecting methanol prices to stay above 400 this year, or at least average 400. Is it fair to say that you guys have factored in that new capacity from Iran? And then have you thought about potential ethylene price erosion? And what that does to MTO for some of the new U.S. crackers in the Gulf Coast? Mark Rohr : Yes. I think I was probably a bit too \u2013 I probably pushed out a bit further my comments than I really wanted to. I mean, we expect methanol prices to be up year-over-year, and they\u2019re up quite handsomely today. But we do expect more pressure in the back half of the year as these new volumes come on. And we\u2019re expecting as part of that, the MTO plants to run flat out like they are now. So my kind of gut is that you\u2019re going to see some reduction in that methanol value as you get on through the year. And for that reason, around your first comment, we expect the first half of the year to be stronger than the second half numbers that [indiscernible] but you could see quarter-to-quarter volatility that could even be inconsistent with that, if I can say that. So yes, we\u2019re off to a good start for the year. We should have a pretty okay first quarter in that process. We think the first half will be stronger than the second half for these reasons \u2013 these structural reasons that I mentioned. Dan DiCicco : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Mark, with regard to the cigarette filter tow market, can you elaborate on your expectations for 2018 and perhaps touch upon things like inventory levels, input cost expectations and selling price trajectory for that business? Mark Rohr : Well, I make a few comments and then Scott is going to comment. That business, we\u2019ve said that we anticipate keeping the earnings relatively flat, and we do, and we\u2019re doing that through productivity, though. That business is still stressed, and we expect it to continue to be stressed as cigarette demand around the world continues to fall. So we don\u2019t \u2013 compared to input prices of those things, that really doesn\u2019t \u2013 none of those things matter as much as the hard reality that the market continues to collapse. And we\u2019re just managing that process in a pretty effective way through productivity. Scott, want to fill in anything? Scott Sutton : No, I would echo exactly the same thing, look, demand continues to fall somewhat. There\u2019s certainly price pressure in the industry. It\u2019s competitive. But we offset that with productivity around taking out costs. And you\u2019ll see us do that in 2018, and 2018 will be pretty similar to 2017 in terms of earnings. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then second if I may. What was your volume growth in Advanced Engineered Materials exclusive of acquisition activity? Scott Sutton : Yes. So this is Scott. I mean, exclusive of acquisitions for the full year, we grew volume about 13% for the fourth quarter. It was similar to that, about 13% as well. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then one last one, if I may. Can you talk about the pension injection of $316 million? Was that done for tax reasons or reasons of strategic flexibility? Mark Rohr : Well, I think both. I mean, it was a \u2013 we had been \u2013 you kind of know this. We had \u2013 a few years ago, we had a pretty sizable pension liability, and we've systematically worked it down. We think at the highest level principally, that's the right thing to do. We have something like 25,000 retirees \u2013 legacy retirees at Celanese, and it means a lot to us to make sure those men and women were all taken care of forever. We were advantaged to do it in the fourth quarter given the interest rates and given the change in the tax law. And that comes through as a benefit to us from a cash flow point of view this year. So we feel pretty good about that move. Now we're able to balance it pretty well, and we think that we have completely divorced ourselves from worrying about pensions. But we certainly will be able to balance it, protect it more, and I hope at some point in the future be able to annuitize it and kind of take the pension accounting a little bit off the table. Kevin McCarthy : I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. When do you expect the Blackstone transaction to close? Or are the probabilities too uncertain to really forecast the date? Mark Rohr : Well, we said last year when we visited in June or whenever that was, we expected it midyear, and I think that's still kind of the view that we have. That can move around a little bit, depending on the heat of the day. But that seems to be when we look at the timeline and the pace of things, we think that's what we'll see. Jeff Zekauskas : And for my follow-up, in Acetyl Intermediates, your EBITDA went up about $30 million sequentially. Is that mostly from China, in Europe? Or if you had to divide it across your geographies, where were the larger sequential EBITDA benefits? Where were the smaller ones? Scott Sutton : Yes. And so Jeff, this is Scott. I mean, the best performance improvement came in Asia, particularly China. However, that has repercussions on the rest of the globe as well. So we got some margin expansion outside of China. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Did your U.S. business grow sequentially or because of outages, no? Scott Sutton : Yes. No, I mean, all of it grew in terms of absolute margin expansion. Jeff Zekauskas : I mean, in terms of EBITDA dollars? Scott Sutton : Yes. In terms of EBIT or EBITDA, yes. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Mark. Mark, it's a two-part question on, obviously, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the sort of China pollution curb side of things. So two questions about that. One on the acetic side of things. So within acetic, how much of a bump-up should we expect to see, let's say, in terms of global utilization rates from some of these curbs that have been talked about pollution-related in China? So that's one side of it. The other one is acetic raws. So obviously methanol, a large part of, obviously, the methanol growth story is predicated on MTO. So should we expect to see any curbs on the sort of influx of new methanol capacity via the sort of coal to methanol side of things and, thereafter, MTO side of things as a result of this as well? Mark Rohr : Well \u2013 and have Scott hop in, in a little bit. We use the term now that's really instantaneous capacity, which is a view of kind of the operating environment of the day. And in that instantaneous capacity, it's quite often different than shell capacity that's out there. And we have seen, as we went through the last year or so, we have seen instantaneous capacity rates continue to rise within China. And I'm looking at Scott here. I don't think we will see that changing or feel like that's going to change. So whether that's 10 basis points or 12 basis points or something like that, but \u2013 so we're up in the 80s now, probably on the instantaneous today kind of rate. We don\u2019t \u2013 equally, we don\u2019t see that the supply-demand is such that it\u2019s going to move around necessarily a whole a lot. We\u2019re not anticipating a bunch of new plants to be built for the reasons I mentioned earlier nor we think it will go back to some lower level in the future. When you look at methanol, the methanol-MTO leak is the most important equation because really, it\u2019s going to tell you about incremental methanol value in China, sets that floor, which has a big ripple effect around the world for the chain business that\u2019s out there. And if you believe that nat gas stays low in the U.S., which I think most of us believe, then it says that methanol globally is going to stay competitive relative to the average ethylene price in China. So methanol to MTO to ethylene, you should have a good window of arbitrage there available to those builders. So we think MTO is going to stay strong in China and may even have more capacity added. But certainly, we think it\u2019s going to stay strong. So we think those things naturally buffer themselves. Now if you get one, two, three, or four new methanol plants coming on the next four or five years, I mean, that may change a little bit. But we kind of think the methanol is not going to stay in the low 200s like it had been. And It may go back different time to time. We think it\u2019s shifted up and it\u2019ll be in the 300s, in the mid-300s, and that\u2019s a good place for us from an acetic acid point of view and that chain point of view. Scott, you want to.. Scott Sutton : Yes, Mark. I mean, I would just add, the impact on us with all these MTO dynamics, it really does interject a lot of volatility into the world and into our model. And we have the opportunity to capitalize on that volatility on the way up or on the way down. And you\u2019ll see ethylene move around. Hence, you\u2019ll see rates of MTO plants move around. You\u2019ll see methanol price move up and down because of that. It\u2019s unlikely to get stuck like it got stuck in 2016 at a very low point. Mark Rohr : Yes. These plants are big, and they\u2019re complicated to run. And like we saw there early last year, when we had a major unit get operational difficulties, they ended up swinging 250,000 tons if I recall,-ish, 200,000 tons of methanol in and out of the market. So those swings Scott is talking about. So fundamentally, it\u2019s been shifted up. You\u2019re going to have nonetheless more volatility because of that C1 to C2 connection going through these assets. At Celanese, we like high pricing and we like volatility, so it\u2019s good for us. Hassan Ahmed : Got it. And really quickly if I could sort of a follow-up on the methanol side of things. I mean, you talked about certain people sort of talked to you guys about the influx of new capacity in Iran. But obviously, there\u2019s some charter that Iran may actually consider converting most of their methanol facilities into MTO facilities, which obviously could be hugely bullish for methanol demand going forward. How are you guys thinking about the Iranian sort of MTO conversion side of things? Mark Rohr : Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m going back. I\u2019m an old guy. So Iranians are very capable. They have great technical acumen and great engineers. I have no doubt they can run anything they build. I think the more you invest in these businesses, though, the more technically complex they occur. And it\u2019s not for the faint of heart to get into that when you get in the C2 chemistry. So I guess, I\u2019m a bit \u2013 they may do it \u2013 I think they do it in a modest fashion, just my gut, because the investments are still large, but who knows? If they put it in, they\u2019ll run it. And I think if they run it, they\u2019re going to consume more methanol. So it gets back to this methanol dynamic. It\u2019s good for us. Hassan Ahmed : Understood. Very helpful. Thank so much. Operator : Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark, you just mentioned that you\u2019re very excited about the potential to build a methanol plant in the U.S. How do you think about the sizing of this plant and the timing? Is the idea here to just fully integrate or maybe go a little methanol to some degree? Mark Rohr : Yes, Alex. What I said is that we\u2019re really enthusiastic about C1 chemistry chain. And we look at that methanol opportunity as an opportunity for C1 chemistry and especially in terms of how we think about working with other people to expand the molecules in our portfolio. So I wouldn\u2019t go quite so far as to say that I\u2019m announcing the construction of a methanol plant today. But it is certainly on the table for us, and it has been on the table and it's certainly on the table today for us and especially on the table as we talk to others about the things we can do together relative to growing our business, the C1 chemistry business. Aleksey Yefremov : Got it. Thank you for clarification. Staying with acetyls. How do you look at seasonality in China? To what degree the tightness that we see right now is due to the seasonal shutdowns, either on the coal side or maybe downstream in acetyls or in methanol? So do you think just that seasonal impact will be there going forward? Or it's not really about that? Mark Rohr : Well, it's there to some extent. I mean, you certainly have the winter season and the winter heating season, which means that nat gas comes out of the market and goes in all of those applications, and there is some nat gas derivative there. So the way we look at it \u2013 the way I look at it \u2013 Scott may do it differently, is it's almost like Chinese New Year. So you have before Chinese New Year kind of conduct and you have post conduct. So I think you'll see that seasonality like we have seen it, but it \u2013 again, at this new stepped up rate, it has less of an impact than it used to have before. Scott Sutton : Yes, I agree. I mean, but I think, look, disruptions are going to be part of every calendar year going forward, right? And it just so happens that there's a few more certainly in Asia as you approach Chinese New Year. In fact, there's just as many turnarounds on the calendar going forward as there's been over the last 12 months as well. So I think we have a fairly consistent pattern. Aleksey Yefremov : I guess, just to clarify my question, you don't think some of your competitors are down because [indiscernible] methanol because of the seasonal shutdowns. Scott Sutton : Well, definitely in China, there's been some, right? There's been some restriction on gas even transfer of where the coal origination is used as well. So you see those impacts. And yes, that's where see the most volatility today. Aleksey Yefremov : Got it. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Auston, we\u2019ll take one last question with the follow-up and then wrap up the call. Operator : All right, thank you. And our last question will come from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning Mark and Scott. Mark Rohr : Good morning Matthew. Matthew Blair : Just touching on Omni. What kind of end markets are you most excited about here? And then also on the financial side, any more color on why this deal is EPS-neutral this year given that it would boost revenue by 2%. And I thought it offered EBIT margins around where like SO.F.TER. and Nilit were. Scott Sutton : Sure Matthew, thanks. Yes, Thanks for the question. I mean, the end markets, first of all, there's a few complementary markets to where we're already in. There's some auto. There's good electrical and electronics. But interestingly enough, it also provides us access to some markets that we don't participate in a big way today. Most namely, the higher-end furniture market is a big part of their business, so we're excited about that as we can move some of our solutions and existing products into that market. As far as it being accretive or not, I mean, there is a step-up in some first-year costs that we have that basically make it a zero from an EPS standpoint. And then I think you had a third one, too, but can you repeat that, Matthew? Matthew Blair : No, you covered it. My follow-up, we've seen some reports of unplanned issues, mostly regarding problems affecting Nanjing, Jurong and then your Clear Lake methanol facility. Can you just provide any color here? What kind of financial impacts might this have? And how long do you expect these feedstock limitations to persist? Scott Sutton : Yes. Well, this is Scott again. I don\u2019t we would talk about first quarter things that are going on. We have these impacts in the third quarter and, in particular, some in the fourth. And yes, we experienced issues with the cold now. We're not going to quantify those. They're not going to be gigantic but there is some small impacts. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Surabhi Varshney for any closing remarks. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Auston. We will now conclude the call. Thank you for all your questions and for listening in this morning. We\u2019re available after the call to address any further questions you may have. Auston, please close the call now. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Celanese First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Steven. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation's first quarter 2018 earnings release was distributed via Business Wire yesterday after market close. Slides and prepared remarks for the quarter were also posted on our Web site, www.celanese.com in the Investor Relations section. As a reminder, some of the matters discussed today and included in our presentation may include forward-looking statements concerning, for example, our future objectives and plans. Please note the cautionary language contained in the posted slides. Also, some of the matters discussed and presented include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Explanations of these measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures are included with the press release and on our Web site in the Investor Relations section under Financial Information. The earnings release and non-GAAP reconciliations have been submitted to the SEC on Form 8-K. The slides and prepared comments have also been submitted to the SEC on a separate Form 8-K. This morning, we'll begin with introductory remarks from Mark Rohr and then open up for your questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Mark now. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Surabhi, and welcome to everyone listening in today. I\u2019ll begin with just a few highlights before opening the call for your questions. For the quarter, net sales rose 26% year-over-year and 16% sequentially to $1.85 billion. With strong pricing and volume support, we are pleased to announced GAAP earnings of $2.68 per share and adjusted earnings of $2.79 per share. Engineered Materials, Acetate Tow and the Acetyl Chain as well as our affiliates all reported strong results, continuing the trend that\u2019s been underway for some time. Adjusted EBIT margins expanded by 300 basis points, achieving record operating EBITDA of $553 million and EBITDA margins of 30%. Engineered Materials reported net sales of $655 million supporting record segment income of $118 million, driven by projects, acquisitions and higher sales in Asia. Volume increased 19% year-over-year and adjusted EBIT margins for Engineered Materials came in at 27%. Affiliate earnings grew 26% year-over-year to $54 million. We saw strong growth in Asia and we commercialized over seven reported new projects this quarter. The Acetate Tow segment income in the first quarter was $78 million, declined a bit year-over-year as unique carryovers in the first quarter of 2017 could not repeat themselves. The Acetyl Chain grew 32% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, reported net sales of $1 billion for the quarter and record income of $253 million. Modest but consistent demand growth and high regional supply dynamics help lift pricing and generate the significant growth in earnings. Margins expanded to 24% as more than 400 basis points sequentially with strong asset and derivative pricing in all markets. For the rest of this year, we expect Engineered Materials to build on this success with more than 3,000 project wins with additional bolt-on acquisitions and continued growth in Asia. Earnings in Acetate Tow should step down slightly next quarter and remain at that level through the year. Consistent demand growth and business fundamentals through the Acetyl Chain should support earnings growth through \u201919 and \u201920. Given the strong performance in all these businesses, we increased our expected guidance and adjusted earnings per share to the 20% to 25% range over 2017. With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Surabhi. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Steven, please open the lines for Q&A now. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : I guess, first of all, on the acquisition contribution to Engineered Materials. I know that you didn\u2019t break it out specifically as a -- just embedded in the volumes and I think it was a few quarters ago you were talking about, you spoke about how you expect acquisitions to scale up overtime because they gave you more to push off on goal. Can you give us a sense for how much extra capacity you have in Engineered Materials or what investment cycle you need to do to support the volume growth you\u2019re seeing? Scott Sutton : Along with those acquisitions did come the ability to easily expand capacity without much capital, and we\u2019re in the process of doing that and we still have some available. However, at the same time, we have a number of investments going on in both compounding and at least one polymer expansion that are underway this year and we expect more than in the future. So we\u2019re doing both items, organic expansion and extending the capacity that we acquired through acquisitions. Mark Rohr : And that fits Laurence within the $300 million to $350 million of capital that we projected for the next several years in previous calls with them. Laurence Alexander : And then secondly, can you update us on your thinking on the Chinese environmental tightening and the related shutdowns, in particular I guess how you\u2019re thinking about the tailwind from \u201918 into \u201919 and \u201920. Do you see it subsiding or do you -- what do you see as the longer term trend for the Acetyl\u2019s business? Mark Rohr : So I think if you think about the Acetyl\u2019s business, you got to take a long-term view and you got to think of slow rates of change. So we have a business that is growing 2% or 3% per year, maybe accelerating little bit, so maybe 3% or 4% right now with that kind of percentages per year. And if you look back at the cycle, probably in the 11 time frame we peaked out and shelf capacity somewhere in there. So you have this big build up in China as you all know, Laurence, the 2008, \u201909, \u201910 where money was free and then we wanted to build a plant and then we want to convert coal, which is also for China. So it\u2019s an easy conversion to make. Since then capacity has been relatively flat and we\u2019ve seen that creep slowly build effective capacity utilization. And so imagine at 2% or 3% decline in that capacity over the time, the available capacity. So we thought ourselves today at the 80% range on average little bit above that, we saw a short term, short term being the last couple of quarters, some tension on that so maybe it\u2019s 83, 84, 85 something like that short term capacity utilization. When we look at China per se and the regulations that are going in the host of those and all the regions that are impacted, we believe there is going to be 5% capacity reduction as that runs its course over the next three or four years, that kind of timeframe. So we think you got 5% coming off the top of that at that time. At the same time, you\u2019re going to be from the bottom taking away another 5% or 6%. So there should be about 10% uptick net-net over the next three to four years. Laurence Alexander : Are you implying that you need to add capacity, I mean just as a clarification. Mark Rohr : I think the incremental capacity, yes. We\u2019re adding incremental capacity now as you know. And from my point of view as you get into some time in next decade, you will see capacity addition come off but it\u2019s a long ways away. And today, I think what I\u2019m seeing is incremental capacity as a way to go. The other thing you can do is you can look at find ways to bring in all toward the market. So that\u2019s the thing you don\u2019t see happening now. The tightness is going to be with us for a while. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Mark, in Acetyl\u2019s following to Laurence\u2019s question. What the normalized earnings rate here absent the Q1 benefitted from the outages. And I think you said -- did you say you expect to see rates increase 10% in the industry going forward. So based on that, how should we\u2019d be thinking about normalized earnings power in Acetyl\u2019s over the next two to three years? Mark Rohr : Well, we\u2019re going to go into lot of detail on it in a few weeks and I don\u2019t want to steal the thunder of that. We don\u2019t have a normalized earnings and overview of that business, that earnings should grow and should continue to grow in that business for a good while. And so a lot of people think of this business is being cyclical, but I think if you really look out on the capacity point of view, it\u2019s only going through one cycle in last 18 years by my math and demands being pretty consistent and it was just a way of build when that happened. So I think we\u2019re moving back to a high capacity utilization scenario. And in that timeframe in the past, you would routinely see prices of Acetyl\u2019s sales $10 a ton we\u2019re nowhere close to level today. So I think you\u2019re going to see it continue to grow David as we get out to the next two and three four years. David Begleiter : And just on Acetate Tow, Mark. Is there a plan B now post the JV being not going through? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think we got plan B too. We have got B, C and D we\u2019re working. So we said it\u2019d be flat, we\u2019re putting forth plans and we\u2019ll share those with you guys to keep it flat through this next planning cycle through 2020. And we will share that when we get to the other in a few weeks. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Just to follow-up on the Acetyl\u2019s and the question about normalized and so forth. Do you have any sense as to -- given the fly up in -- firs off, I forgot to say, hey, congratulations on your new role Mr. Richardson. What do you think the fly up benefit was from the very tight market condition in Acetyl\u2019s was in Q1? Obviously, there\u2019s $231 million blew away any prior -- would you say $50 million, $60 million, $70 million of a short term benefit that you realized in the quarter? Mark Rohr : I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve looked at that, I am looking at Scott. I mean, the machine produced that number and if the machine wasn\u2019t in place, we didn\u2019t have flexibility and we didn\u2019t have adaptability and we\u2019re locked in a long term contract with cost plus basis. I am not sure what it would have been heck a lot less than that\u2026 Scott Sutton : Frank, I would just add to that that really what's going on here is you do see the fundamentals improving, and like Mark said, those fundamentals will be improving over the course of the next few years. You can imagine that even within those improving fundamentals that you do get a little variability quarter-to-quarter. So there\u2019s little extra sitting in Q1 relative to where we might be in Q2 but it's not a great deal. Frank Mitsch : It\u2019s an interesting comment that you\u2019re expecting Acetyl up in 2019 after setting up a very, very difficult comp for the first quarter so obviously, there isn\u2019t a great expectation for you that that will continue to improve on the operating basis. And just if I could, free cash flow obviously was on the light side here in the first quarter. How should we think about the cadence of free cash flow to get to that over $900 million for 2018? Scott Richardson : We expect that to catch up through the year. So what we saw in the first quarter was really just the timing of collection so about 40% of our Q1 sales occurred in the month of March. And so just from a timing standpoint, a lot of that collection pushes into April. Mark talked about the strength that we saw in Asia. We have slightly longer terms there, so that plays a role as well. And Scott Sutton talked about new capacity that we get for very little investment in our acquisition. One of the things that we do is really optimize how we produce and run on those assets, which is moving from what make the order model we had in those businesses when we acquired them to a better balance between make the order make the stock. And so you saw inventory tick up as well. In addition, we had a little bit of increase in CapEx to support the growth in the businesses. So those are really the reasons for where the free cash flow number came-in in Q1 and we expect to catch that up as we move through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: I just want to go back to Acetyls one more time. I think you mentioned that -- or you were hinting that this business should continue to grow into 2019. But in your prepared remarks here, you\u2019re saying that margins were 24% and you expect 20% margins for the year. So that implies some give back in second half. Can you just talk about that? Mark Rohr : Well, I think we\u2019re trying to range by this I think a little bit is we had 24% margin in the quarter and that was up 400 basis points over the prior quarter at 20%. I think what we say as a normalized margin rate for us is between 24% and 20%, somewhere in that for the year, I\u2019m looking at Scott want to say that, but something like that. And so when you get pass margin, you got volume and so volume is a function not only of demand but also people are up or down I think like that, so you get a little bit of volume pull back as we get through the year and some of these going to start P.J. I mean that\u2019s how we do the math, it\u2019s not -- we're not contract down the volume basis effective take on a contract. So we\u2019re real time in the market so we try and anticipate exactly what this market is going with that. We obviously have turnarounds, we have six different turnaround scheduled this year. We have couple of them occurring and coming up next month, that\u2019s probably $30 million hit, that kind of thing, we don\u2019t to talk about that too much. So those things happen and go through and we don\u2019t think very much about and alert you guys not to as well. They don\u2019t really -- long term they don\u2019t really impact the numbers. P.J. Juvekar: And now that the tow units called off, one of your competitors is taking tow into other products like fibers. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that. And there plans to shut down any capacity? Mark Rohr : We talk a fair amount about it at the Investor Day with that right now, no. I mean there is some other folks that do a great job in fibers, they\u2019re doing it long time we\u2019ve going to get out that business. So I think it\u2019s difficult for us to see running back in there. We have other applications that we\u2019re quite proud of that pushes more to the polymer side and film side, and innovation out there is pretty cool pretty interesting we\u2019re working on. The productivity things that we\u2019re planning and we\u2019ll share more of that as time goes on. And collection of all that, we believe plus strong performance in the China and then growing performance in China, we think that\u2019s been washed out and we\u2019ll be able to have three years or so of no matter what the market does pretty stable earnings -- by the earnings and there is still options for us to do other things. So we\u2019ll share more of that with you. So I think the important thing that you should hear from me is that as it relates to cash flow from that business, we don\u2019t see that changing over the next three years. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : When you guys contemplated strategy 3.0 for the EM business, do you anticipate you can continue to achieve those high single organic volume growth rates. And then what more do you need in that toolkit, either from a product or geographic standpoint? And can you talk about the staffing needs as you continue to grow that business so aggressively? Mark Rohr : Well, I\u2019ll make just a brief comment and then let Scott dig into that. But if you look at that business and the success that the team has had, we\u2019ve grown earnings I believe $70 million, $80 million to $90 million year-over-year for the last three years. As you think in terms of this year, about north of $100 million to $100 million plus in that growth and that\u2019s going to be embedded right that we have built in a model. So we see that containing so saying that this is a strong growth and strong contribution of business out there. We believe that the project model is, to the end, the S-curve is nowhere near curved out and then we have plans to lay curves on top of that with things like translation. So we feel really strongly that that model is going to continue to generate that high single digits growth that\u2019s out there, and that\u2019s a year-over-year basis not necessarily quarter-to-quarter. Scott, do you want to talk about process that where that business is going from a point of your products and markets and\u2026 Scott Sutton : Look, I mean that business really is that up to not only extend earnings but grow earnings further. And to your question of what do we really need to be able to do that. Well, as you know, we have a pretty novel model there that matches up the robust market opportunity that we have really with the broadest solution set in the industry. So you'll see us do things like expand that solutions set. Some of that will be organic but it could be inorganic as well. There are a few polymers that we\u2019re not experts in today that we can do that. We also have opportunity in other geographies, we already may not have a giant presence today and that\u2019s a prime target for a bolt-on acquisition. I mean, the key to making this work is we have a great team running this business and operating in this business, and that novel model is our intellectual property. And that great team focuses on working on that model every day, improving processes so that we can be globally connected and solve solutions around the world for customers and that's what we'll continue to do. Bob Koort : And do you have any metrics, Scott, you can share around headcount, product, development, R&D. I mean, obviously, if you\u2019re growing that fast, I assume it's got to be a burden on your internal staffing and growth there. Can you talk about how you achieve that? Scott Sutton : I wouldn\u2019t it\u2019s a burden. Of course, I\u2019d tell you more as a challenge. I mean the number one metric we have is well-known number of projects that we get wins on. We\u2019ll get 3,000 purchase orders for new projects this year. But what will go up is our commercialization rate. We brought that from a lower level up to almost 45% today. We are adding some resources, Bob, but we also continue to get more efficient as well. Mark Rohr : I\u2019ll make a comment on that and to what Scott said. The focus here on efficiency is what\u2019s made that model is being element we\u2019ve needed in that model to make it work for the organization that we have absent that improving efficiency we\u2019d start to top out that S-curve, so we\u2019ve not done that yet. What we\u2019re focused on now is other dimensions. So we think the classic S-curve, so you know the development phase, the growth phase and the maturation phase. As we move up that curve and this machine that gets better and better that machine, it\u2019s important that we find way to translate more of these products, because translation is whole another dimension of efficacy of this model and we\u2019ll talk about that in few weeks how we approach that, how we lever our success in one area to another area. And to be very honest, we\u2019re just scratching the surface on that. That\u2019s going to make our growth here happen without proportionate addition of resources because we just get better and better in what we do and it becomes easier for us to grow. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Mark, I was hoping if you back up a bit and touch on the overall macro, you called that China as a driver for both Engineered Material and Acetyl. What about the other regions? How would you characterize global growth as we see it today? Mark Rohr : Well, from a very high level for us, the entire world is doing well. We have strong business in the Americas and improving footprints across the Americas. We have very strong performance in Europe and great innovation in Europe, great connectivity with all the major OEMs and innovative OEMs in Europe it really drives a lot of growth in Europe and around the world. In Japan, we\u2019re seeing stronger performance and we\u2019re seeing more connectivity with the Japanese OEMs inside Japan with our team and that translates in the business outside of Japan as well. And then you get into China, China just continues to improve and it\u2019s plastic material upgrade, a lot of work with autos there, while we work with consumer goods there, and it\u2019s all to make them better for their local market. So we see every place doing pretty well. Ghansham Panjabi : And just second question, last quarter you pointed towards the legacy consumer specialty segment being flat on an EPS basis for 2018. Do you still think that will be the case in the context of the re-segmentation of food? And then can you update us on the EPS contributions from each of the segments given your big guidance raise for the year? Thanks. Mark Rohr : We look at it as Acetate Tow now that we call it and we\u2019re good stewards with that business, and we\u2019ve been saying we\u2019ll be flat for a couple of years and we\u2019ve been flat for a couple of years, and it will be flat this year. So we\u2019re able to manage that business in a way that we continue earnings in spite of the fact that there\u2019s this gradual decline underway. I do want to mention that business is a lot common to date since we run through that capacity drop it occurred when the Chinese put in forth so much material, that\u2019s almost fully on its course. So now you\u2019re seeing more of a normalized situation. So we\u2019re going to be flat this year and I think we can be in our way for the next three years, which is a basis of our plan. And you said the EBIT by segment, and so I\u2019ll take a stab at it and Scott weigh a little bit. So Scott told you we\u2019re flat you got that in Acetate Tow, it\u2019s flat, so that\u2019s pretty easy one to do. And flat for us it\u2019s plus or minus $10 million something like that. So we\u2019re not that good but flat is what would say that to be. If you look at the end business, we\u2019ve already told you 100 plus that\u2019s that business. And you get into 200, 200 plus and then the chains business and that\u2019s going to how the math is going to work out. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Mark, when you think about Engineered Materials, you\u2019ve doubled the business since the last downturn, and you think about the pace of acquisitions potential. What do you see is the potential to grow this business over the next three to five years? Scott Sutton : I think in terms of more acquisitions, there\u2019s a broad slate of candidates out there, and we have a very big pipeline. And we are talking to 100 to 200 over the course of 12 months that we put through a funnel process. And you\u2019ve seen us come up with and be able to match objectives. We said we\u2019d be doing nylon and we\u2019ve done nylon. Now, we\u2019re looking even at other growth technology initiatives that we have. For example, medical, energy storage, these things we\u2019ll be trying to find acquisitions that match up to those needs. But at the end of the day, there's a lot of opportunity out there, Mike. It's about finding the best opportunity and of course we\u2019re going to pay the right value for these. We target around the multiple of 10. So there\u2019s really not a cap on Engineered Materials. And you got to remember where call it 1% of global Engineered Materials business out there. So there is plenty of opportunity, it\u2019s just a matter of us progressing on those. Mark Rohr : If the 70, 80, 90 or 100 plus, I mean you look at 100, 100 and 100, and if you just look at the additive factor of that, that is the base model we have in place today. And we still have opportunity to make that work the way that\u2019s work, we don\u2019t see that changing, Mike. What we\u2019ve not talked about is increased optimality that we\u2019re getting as we go into business. The business is getting a bit tighter, so with a lot of these Engineered Materials the capacity is not longing it\u2019s getting quite short. We\u2019ve done incremental expansions under way. We\u2019ll be adding more volume as we go through these next several years, so producing more volume which is a good thing. It\u2019s needed by the market, very, very cost effective for us to do that. And we still not talked about a bigger deal that there\u2019s couple of those out there that we continue to play with. So I think this business -- if you relate a straight edge on what\u2019s happened the last several years that\u2019s how I\u2019d point it out. Mike Sison : And then in term of your outlook for \u201918 in Engineered Materials, I think I might have missed. But your first quarter organic growth was, I don\u2019t know what that was but for the full year, should be about high-single digits to maybe double-digits for organic growth? Scott Sutton : Mike, I mean if you think from a volume standpoint for the full year organically, it should be in the high-single digits. If you think about what happened in first quarter, just think about it from a revenue standpoint, the acquisitions added almost half of that revenue growth and the rest of that revenue growth was organic. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Question just on Ibn Sina started up early this year. Can you flush out how that\u2019s going to roll through this year, how long it will take for that plan to fill out, how much was just the step-up in ownership versus -- again you\u2019ve increased operating rates throughout this year. And then does that anniversary all the way through the first half of next year then? Scott Sutton : I mean, we did start up that plan expansion there last year. We\u2019ve been withdrawing volume from that in a pretty good cliff so far that supported our growth, it\u2019s not running at capacity and it will take through this year or probably to get to that level. The earnings have stepped up a little bit and they will stay at that stepped up level through the rest of the year, most of that come from the increased economic ownership that we have there. It\u2019s not going to be a dramatic step up. I mean there is even turnaround scheduled within that joint ventures as well, but you will see it similar to where it is in first quarter. Duffy Fischer : And then if you could just comment on the Slide 9, you talked a little bit about free cash flow from that slide. Can you talk about just cash flow from ops, the big step down each of the last two years from that base of high 200s and what\u2019s in a way of that cash flow? Scott Sutton : Duffy, it\u2019s really just timing for us. We see again being greater than $900 million for the year. And so just what we saw from the strength of the business, particularly in the second half of the quarter, we\u2019re collecting that now in April and we see that continuing as we move through the year. So we should catch up as we move through to the second quarter and into the third quarter and be back on that trajectory of being in excess of those quarterly -- how we track quarterly going forward through the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : With the benefit from trading activity and acetyls above normal in the quarter, Eastman didn\u2019t come back until the start of the quarter. So I would imagine opportunities for trading was so high at the start of the quarter. Mark Rohr : I don\u2019t know what your question is. What do you mean trading? John Roberts : Well, I think you said last year you traded the lease the equivalent of a world scale plan. It sounded like it\u2019s all there\u2026 Mark Rohr : I think our activity in the early in the year this year was lot more price oriented than volume was. Our volume we did trade some, we did move some third party volume in that period of time. As we get into this quarter still some pricing and some volume is going on. John Roberts : And then you mentioned there may still be opportunities to extract further value. The Blackstone deal had operational synergies but I think it also gave you a path to potentially deconsolidate down the road. Do you think you could still find a path to deconsolidate without some merger deal? Mark Rohr : It\u2019s a bit harder. I think with EU it was just real disappointment. I\u2019ll be very honest from really from an economist perspective there is no reason not to, for that deal not to occur. But the European Union had some funny views on this concept called overlapping. They just didn\u2019t want to improve anything unless it was an overlap, which means basically you couldn\u2019t hit the deal. So I think we see a path where we could do a deal in theory and have a path to European Union but practically it\u2019s more difficult. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : I understand the first quarter free cash flow dynamics, but I just want to make sure I am clear on you raised guidance but the full year free cash flow if I\u2019m correct you\u2019re still calling for the same above $900 million. Is that just a continuation of the issue that is you have higher prices in AI, obviously higher working capital from an inventory and receivables perspective and you just have to get into a rolling period where that stays the same and then you get the release of cash flow. Scott Sutton : I mean, that\u2019s the best way to look at. I mean, there's really nothing fundamental going on that of issue. We talked a little bit about the rise in inventory from the M&A integration activity that\u2019s going to continue. And then we expect obviously to collect that, again there is nothing fundamental. Terms are little bit longer given the dynamics we\u2019re seeing right now, because we have more sales in Asia and we saw pricing move up in Asia, particularly through the quarter. And given the outlook that we stated for the balance of year, I think that\u2019s how we see it flowing through. But we don't really see a fundamental issue in cash flow. Mark Rohr : On an annualized basis, that\u2019s right. I think the short term is where we spend a bit more on capital ratably right now than we have been last few quarters. So that was a little bit draw on the first quarter as well. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow up, I can\u2019t help noticing that oil is 75 bucks again. Where would TCX be coming, where would you get that going again? Is it much higher than current levels or how you\u2019re thinking about that if you\u2019re thinking about it at all? Mark Rohr : We\u2019re not really thinking about it at all. I\u2019m looking at the team it looks like they\u2019re thinking about not telling me about it. They look guilty over there, Vincent, I\u2019m not sure. Scott Sutton : It\u2019s interesting. I mean, certainly, ethanol demand for fuel in China is up, there is still the questions over organic versus synthetic to get over. Mark Rohr : China, can\u2019t meet their ethanol mandate. And so I think they\u2019re struggling with it so they could suffer something but we\u2019re really not -- we\u2019re not actually pursuing it. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Visawanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Visawanathan : Just a follow-up on the guidance here, so the 20% to 25% EPS growth. Is there a way to characterize maybe how much is persistent acetyls upside or maybe the acquisition contribution or EM doing better than expected. I mean, I guess I am just curious as to the mechanism as to this coming back down, was lower ethylene may be a positive for your VAM margins in Q1 or\u2026 Mark Rohr : I think, it\u2019s just a rule of thumb, we can\u2019t use -- you can\u2019t be too specific with you numbers when you\u2019re looking at big numbers like this. But in general for us broadly speaking, we've outlined that we\u2019ve got a very good strong year in material and they\u2019re off to a good start and we expect that to continue as we go through the year, so that\u2019s 100 plus quantity with tows flat year-over-year plus or minus 10 million or 15 million bucks, something like it was flat. And then you get into the chain business and chain business has $100 million to $140 million first quarter, I think we\u2019re $200 million plus for the year. So you\u2019re going to see that moderate a bit, but it doesn\u2019t mean a lot of business is not really strong. I mean that\u2019s subtle movements in pricing and then incremental volumes and things like that will moderate. We got a bunch of turnarounds to do in those, each one of those process and offer $10 million to $15 million and we have six of those. So that will all be plugged into that scenario that rolls out as we go through the year. So you should expect a stronger first half than the second half, but you should also expect that the next year is stronger than this year. Scott Sutton : Mark, I would just add to that look I mean, the business strategies are working and materializing. And there\u2019re good concrete fundamentals underneath all three businesses and that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident in saying that this will continue. I mean the acetyls team continues to implement their model and so does the Engineered Materials team. So you see that moving forward. Arun Visawanathan : And then on the acquisition pipeline, you mentioned compounding earlier. I mean are there any other particular substrates and capabilities you're looking for? And what -- you saw that the plan to use the other half may be for buybacks or maybe just reiterate your plans for cash there? Mark Rohr : On the buyback question, we haven\u2019t really made a decision and that we\u2019ll share more in the weeks ahead, so that plan is on share buyback and that\u2019s in part because we see lots of M&A activity theoretically in front of us, so we need to sort through that just a little bit. I\u2019d really not say which molecules are going after and things like that and the M&A. What I will say just echo what Scott has pointed to is that we tend to look at initiatives and that can be a polymer based initiative, which go into heat and go into nylon and so that was just big initiative we\u2019ve been on. And we\u2019ve gone from being a small player in there, I think perhaps the largest independent compounder of nylon, if not we\u2019re pretty close. So that move we made we know how it moves like that underway in medical and energy storage and things like, so we\u2019ll see how those unfold. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : I\u2019d like you to clarify on acetyl intermediate side. Was there any in your discussion or trading activity, was there a one-time trading gain or loss in the numbers for this quarter? Scott Sutton : The answer to that is no. But what I will say is that we have this globally connected model that we go out and activate the network and we measure how we\u2019re doing and how we\u2019re growing by how we activate that network and we continue to increase those number of activation. But there is no specific one-off trading gain or something like that I just want to be clear about that. Jim Sheehan : And then in Engineered Materials, you talked about how you see margins progressing over the next few quarters. When you\u2019re adding in acquisitions, you\u2018ve out talked about those being dilutive. Do you expect to completely offset that dilution and to actually expand margins? And also with the re-segmentation, how should we think about margin runway in that business? Mark Rohr : As well as we\u2019re running bolt-ons, I mean you can expect that margin to be around 19% to 20% without the equity income from the joint ventures. We get a little bit in dilution, but we\u2019re recovering from dilution from previous bolt-ons we did. If we weren\u2019t doing bolt-ons, you would see that come up a little bit. As far as the re-segmentation where we put the food ingredients into the Engineered Materials business, because the project pipeline runs in a similar fashion and you got to think in terms of maybe that\u2019s 5% of the overall Engineered Materials business, so it\u2019s really not impactful. Jim Sheehan : And how dilutive you expect business to this segment? Mark Rohr : It\u2019s not dilutive, similar. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. Hassan Ahmed : Mark, question on the AI side of things. You in your earlier remarks talked about volume growth being quite robust in Q1 and then not being strong over the next couple of quarters. So just trying to get a sense of what volume growth we should expect. It seems that you guys generated 5% year-on-year volume growth in Q1, which seems relatively normal. So I am just trying to understand on the volume front what we should expect for the remainder of the year? Mark Rohr : I think we believe that 3% to 5% if you just look out over the next several years should be a pretty average growth for us. I am looking at Scott, but quarter-to-quarter that can be up and down, and that\u2019s what I think we are. And if you look back over your shoulder, it\u2019s been more like 1% to 2% so it doesn\u2019t take much to make a real difference and we have a number of these pretty incremental expansions we\u2019re doing. And so we can secure that volume and we can also build into that volume in the way where we get very high return. So we\u2019re seeing that volume picture for us and we\u2019ll share more about that in a few days that a big part of our continued growth in earnings in this business. Hassan Ahmed : Now, the methanol side of things, seems to be are continue to be quite strong, price is high, supply-demand seems to be relatively tight. So any further thoughts about a potential second facility in the U. S.? Mark Rohr : Well, we continue to look at it. I think it\u2019s not -- it doesn\u2019t hit the level of these other things we\u2019re doing right now. But it\u2019s certainly -- it remains a very, very viable project and we\u2019ll just keep you guys posted on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Mr. McCarthy your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is a Matt on for Kevin. Just looking at the proposed Chinese import tariffs on plasticized cellulose acetates, I mean, I know you have four tow facilities under JV with CNTC locally in China, I guess expected to attain to you specifically on a company basis. But what do you anticipate will be the fallout on an industry level if there is any? Scott Sutton : I mean, what I would say is you\u2019re right. I mean most of those joint ventures are back integrated in that. We supply a little bit in there but we actually supply from outside the U.S. from another facility. So we\u2019re not impacted. Other acetate does flow into China there, so there could be some impact yet to be seen. Mark Rohr : I would say on that too Matt is that the volumes are pretty low now for everyone. I mean, it\u2019s not -- I wouldn\u2019t get too worked up over that. Unidentified Analyst : And then as a follow up, I guess, you buy a fair amount of ethylene for your VAM and polyethylene production. I think we estimate you somewhere around like 1.25 billion to 1.5 billion pounds a year. I mean, ethylene prices are historic lows. So is that a tailwind for the quarter or do you anticipate this to be a larger for 2Q and do you have a spot buyer or contract buyer? Mark Rohr : As we look at it around the world, you\u2019re right, we bought a lot of ethylene in Asia, we bought a lot in Europe and we\u2019re buying in the U.S. as well. U.S. that\u2019s a lot of pass-through tied to raw materials but most of that\u2019s covered in pass through. So we don\u2019t see a lot of impact of ethylene, especially in the U.S. that\u2019s really have much impact on. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Aleksey Yefremov : Coming back to Engineered Materials, where do you stand in your efforts to raise prices? I think, you're pursuing that earlier this year and you\u2019re continuing to raise in second quarter. And also where do you stand in realizing the full benefit of the recent acquisitions that you made? What\u2019s the level of accretion that incrementally in terms of EPS or margin that we can see later in \u201918 or in 2019? Scott Sutton : In terms of pricing, we\u2019re having some success raising price, you can see that sequentially, prices has come up and we\u2019ve just announced another round. They\u2019re in the process of implementing those prices. And we expect to be successful with most of those increases. Second part of your question was what topic, remind me again\u2026 Aleksey Yefremov : Recent acquisitions in Engineered Materials. Are you fully realizing the benefit of integration or is there some incremental benefit? Scott Sutton : There is incremental benefit left. I mean maybe we\u2019re a third of the way through with integrating those three acquisitions. I won\u2019t give specific numbers but remember we went back and said that look one or two of those added $0.10 a share in the first year and another one maybe added $0.09 a share. So everything is progressing to plan. But at the end of the day, those will double, triple those values over the course of the first three years, that\u2019s the way to think about it. Surabhi Varshney : Steven, we will now conclude the call. Thank you for your questions and for listening in this morning. We\u2019re available after the call to address any further questions you may have. Steven, please close the call. Operator : Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Celanese Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Brandon. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation\u2019s Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliott, Senior Vice President of Acetyls Chain. Yesterday afternoon Celanese Corporation distributed its second quarter 2018 earnings release via Business Wire and posted yesterday after market close. Slides and prepared remarks for the quarter were also and posted slides and remarks about the quarter in the Investor Relations section of our website. Today\u2019s presentation includes statements about expectations for the future results and plans that are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from those project in such forward-looking statements. And additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ can be found in the posted materials. We will also discuss non-GAAP measures and information about which, including reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures, are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials are available on the SEC\u2019s and EDGAR system. We\u2019ll begin with introductory remarks from Mark Rohr and then take your questions. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Surabhi, and welcome, everyone, listening in today. Our prepared comments were published yesterday, so I will be brief and then turn the call over for your questions. We delivered strong consolidated results for the quarter with GAAP earnings of $2.52 per share and record adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share. Robust pricing across product lines resulted in net sales of $1.8 billion with adjusted EBIT margins of 26.6%. All three businesses, the Acetyl Chain, Engineered Materials and Acetate Tow, grew adjusted EBIT year-over-year. The earnings growth along with our focused effort to convert those earnings to cash generated contributed to our highest-ever free cash flow of $500 million in the quarter. We repurchased approximately 900,000 shares and distributed roughly $73 million in dividends this quarter. The remainder of the year, we expect Engineered Materials to continue delivering steady growth by extending the success of the pipeline model and executing on M&A. In Acetyl Chain, we expect market momentum to carry through the third quarter before normal seasonality in the fourth quarter and first quarter impact that business. We do not see the recent tear of disputes as having any material effect on our business. And with that, we are ready for 2018 expectations for adjusted earnings to the range of $10.50 to $10.75 per share with free cash flow generation in excess of $1 billion. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Mark. I\u2019d like to request all callers to please limit to one question and a follow-up. Brandon, please open the line for Q& A Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter there guys. Mark Rohr : Thanks Mike. Mike Sison : First question on the Acetyl Chain, you talked about a lot of outages in 2Q. Can you maybe give us a little bit more feel on the regions, where that happened? And then do you expect the utilization rate to stay at 90% for third quarter? Mark Rohr : Yes, let me start this, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Todd Elliott to give you more color. But we were \u2013 I think in the last call, we gave a perspective that we were in the mid-80% utilization rate. We have seen that push up to the 90% kind of range to this quarter, and we expect that to move back down towards mid-80% range as we go through the back half of this year. Todd, would you like to add color to that and maybe some color? Todd Elliott : Yes. I mean, we continue to an overall theme of a continuing improvement in utilization rates, and this really goes back over the last couple of years. We will continue to see solid demand growth across multiple end uses. Demand growing at about 3% to 4% per year across all these different end uses. Limited supply. Frankly, limited supply since the overbill back in the 2009, 2010 and 2011 period. So we\u2019ve seen a steady march up in operating utilization rates, and we put that in the mid-80% level in the last year and then through most of this year. And to your question, there have been multiple effects from combination of Chinese energy reform, environmental reform late last year through the first part of this year, plus a whole series of unplanned outages in multiple regions over the course of the year. So that\u2019s pushed up instantaneous operating utilization rates up around the 90% range, certainly, in Q2. So some of that will moderate, I think as we look out, but continued good environment. Mike Sison : Great. And then Mark, when you think about your outlook for this year, you\u2019re awfully close to your 2020 goals already, it seems, on an EPS basis. What\u2019s the best way to think about, I guess, earnings progression into 2019 and to 2020 given how strong 2018 has turned out? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think in May, we put forth a view that we would generate about $30 per share equivalent of earnings over three years, $9, $10 and $11 per share. I think we\u2019re higher than that number now. So I would look at it kind of that way that somewhere between $30 and $33 per share some cumulative over that period of time as what I would think. How that actually flows through, Mike, on a quarter-to-quarter basis is really hard for me to quantify in that. So we\u2019ve got off to a good start. We\u2019re going to finish very strong, probably closer to 12 and 11 in that range and will be somewhere about think in the high between those as we enter next year. But again, it\u2019s a bit hard to call that specifically. It\u2019s easier to call the [indiscernible] than it is in next year. Mike Sison : Great, thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good morning. I guess first off, following up on the last question, the mid-80% utilization rate up to 90%, was that delta purely because of China curtailments, either temporary or permanent? Or was there some other meaningful additives there? Mark Rohr : No. That was a global \u2013 that\u2019s a global spin. Ghansham Panjabi : And how would that parse out China specifically? Mark Rohr : I think you should look at China been type overwhelming. You should look at China as having a sort of a steady erosion, small bits of erosion to the overall capacity utilization over the next three years and not the kind of short-term impact we have in the units being up and down like we\u2019ve had this time. Todd Elliott : Yeah. I mean, most of the curtailment that we\u2019ve seen has occurred during the winter months : end of year, start of New Year. So, we saw that into 2017, start of this year, in 2018. Just the overall utilization picture in the mid-80% range is pretty healthy just to begin with. And then you overlay curtailments adjustment that we\u2019ve been describing. And then on top of that, there have been a series of unplanned outages that really go back to last year and\u2026 Mark Rohr : Most of those are out of China. Todd Elliott : But even in other regions, I mean, Asia and I don\u2019t want to name competitor names that are in the other parts of the world. And those have contributed to push up further up close to 90%. So, it\u2019s a combination of things that keep us hovering in the mid-80-plus range. And again, that\u2019s been a supportive environment. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, terrific. Thank you. And for my second question, I guess, on tariffs. You cited the potential for incremental growth opportunities given the shift in trade flows, which correct me if I\u2019m wrong, seen specific acetyls, but is there any risk for growth for Engineered Materials in regions such as Asia? How are you sort of thinking about tariff risks specific to EM? Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : No. We don\u2019t, I mean, we don\u2019t see it as a real risk. I mean, the tariff concept is one of \u2013 it\u2019s sort of in and out of the U.S. and the punitive tariffs in support of that. We have a very global network. And to be honest, most of the material we make in China stays in China. And we have the ability to import in the China from the most regions of the world. There are a few cases we\u2019re moving materials from the U.S. into China and then on the EM side and on one end, it\u2019s got a lot. And the other part of that, which have the ability to price most of that out. So, we don\u2019t see a material effect of this. And I\u2019ll be bold to say and I think our network is so unique and our ability to supply locally is so strong, there can be some advantage at the surface if this becomes permanent. Ghansham Panjabi : Yeah, perfect. Thanks so much, Mark. Mark Rohr : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. I\u2019m curious, maybe, Todd; you could talk a little bit about remarks that you gave some more insight into some of the regulatory issues that are confronting companies in China. And I think the way to read is most of those are slanted towards a benefit for Celanese, but I was particularly intrigued by the comments around parks and maybe some additional closures and requests for voluntary curtailments. Can you give us a little more granularity on what you see happening over the next couple of quarters? And whether that makes you a beneficiary or perhaps you\u2019re compromised a bit by these changes? Thanks. Todd Elliott : Yeah. I think the chemical park policy is pretty interesting, and this one is going to affect multiple provinces. And you will, of course, be studying these as we go and trying to be engaged in Beijing and elsewhere to understand. I mean the one, the Shandong province changes is pretty fresh, Shandong in the 2017 with 199 parks. Their target is to approve only 75 parks plus 10 specialty chemical parks. So you think about what\u2019s the 114 take-out parks as you look forward, and it\u2019s one of the first provinces that set standards for future chemical park design in all the regulatory environment. We think that will affect our broad industry going forward. We believe it will, we think it already is affecting when you consider the change in park dynamics and then the relocations and permitting required. But this is \u2013 it\u2019s evolving. We got to understand it and study it and assess it as we go forward. The one other note, as I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, the winter season effects relative to energy gas versus coal and other steps on the environmental side as well. We were actually approached this summer in Nanjing by the municipal EPA. This goes back about four weeks ago, where they\u2019ve requested not only Celanese, but multiple companies in the park to reduce operations by 50%, citing a target to reduce ozone. Again, those are their words, not ours. And not required, we ultimately did not have to do anything, but what\u2019s pretty interesting is that outreach occurred in the middle of the summer. And then only days ago, also in Nanjing, 14 different companies in our park there in Nanjing were brought into a meeting and another request was made to reduce electricity consumption, citing summer season, peak season for electricity. So, it\u2019s just a series of these sort of heightened steps to work that energy balance and then going forward, like the park reference, the environmental picture for China going forward. We think it\u2019s going to have an effect ultimately and as we said during Investor Day, kind of call out maybe a couple of percent utilization change by the end of the decade. Mark Rohr : Bob, for us, we have a phenomenal relationship, but we\u2019re in one of the best parks is there in the Nanjing Park. We have a great, great relationship as do the other companies in that park with the park leadership. So, I think you should look at this as being a cooperative kind of process with companies like ours. And so it\u2019s never been to our disadvantage to support and work with these folks, and I wouldn\u2019t expect that to be the case in the future. It does, however, reflect, as Todd said, this continued erosion of the week and outline kind of businesses that are there and the continued evolution of those away from the operations. Bob Koort : And Mark, if I might ask on TCX, you\u2019ve done a pretty good job of conditioning us to expect not much there. Now you\u2019ve got some sort of transaction. Can you give us a sense of the scale of that? And does it make sense if given Todd\u2019s fairly bullish view on acetic acid operating rates in the industry, would it make sense for any companies to convert some acetic to ethanol capacity? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yeah. Well, I think that we were not able to, as Celanese Corporation, convinced the Chinese government to go to synthetic ethanol as a source. And you're well aware, Bob, of the money that was invested years ago on that energy we put into that. So this asset, we shut down the asset. We've written off the asset. We have a great partner in Chengzhi that is there at the park with us. They're our provider of raw materials for the acetic acid business, and we've worked with them collaboratively on a number of deals that just haven't worked out yet. This has been one that we kind of jointly surfaced and started working on. They have an interest of really trying to promote synthetic ethanol. They're very well connected politically. And so we think that is a better approach and thus trying to do it on our own. So we have, in essence, solved the assets then we got the LOI to a lot of work we have to complete this to sell the assets to them for a nominal amount. There's no real money involved in that. And we're contributing in our TCX technology to a joint venture. And with them in that joint venture, the intent is to promote ethanol from synthetic uses. And our interest in that, of course, is to be the acetic acid provider for that. So that's really or you should think that this is just -- we put this out as not the holy grail of success for acetic acid but rather, it's one more step that we believe will further keep pressure in this market in Asia. And if we're successful with this, we think as we end this decade next, we should be seeing some acetic acid volumes, some material acetic acid volumes heading this way. Q \u2013 Unidenti1nalyst: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Good morning. So Mark, you're shutting down tow capacity in Mexico. I believe that's about 2% to 3% of global capacity, could that pattern of the market temporarily? And my second question related to that is have you looked at this new Juul product, as such new type of e-cigarette that has taken off so quickly? You think that could potentially impact cigarette demand? Mark Rohr : Well, I'm going to answer your first question, as you to repeat it same because I missed it. PJ, you're breaking up a bit. But no, there is no material impact to, as your math noted, to global capacity utilization in terms of our \u2013 it's just the ability to rightsize our asset base with the customers we have and create productivity as a result of that. That's all you should read into that. And would you mind repeating your second question? I'm sorry. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. So this is new Juul product. Juul is a new type of e-cigarette that has taken off very quickly. And cigarette companies seem to be worried about Juul. I was wondering if you had a view on that. Mark Rohr : I'm looking around the room, and I think we're all pretty -- we're not prepared to answer that question with any kind of confidence. So no, it has not been a subject of discussion between ourselves and the customers that are out there. But we'll take a look at that. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, thank you. In Engineered Materials, can you discuss your pipeline for the second half? And you mentioned that during Investor Day that if you don't do any M&A, your margins could improve from current levels. Just talk about the pipeline and where could margins go with or without M&A. Mark Rohr : Yes. So I think, well, first half, there's going to be M&A. We're continuing to promote that. We're active in the marketplace, and we continue to bring in businesses. So we should have a view that M&A is going to materially change over the next several years in our business. That's continued pressure from that. The one I'm most interested in today is 8% margin, just to give you a reference point on that. So you're going to keep having that pressure on the raw margins. We have a good pace underway in the mid-700-ish kind of new projects this last quarter, so we should be able to press 3,000 at the end of the year, maybe a little short of that but that kind of range. One of the things that Surabhi has been doing with the team is we're rolling out sort of EM strategy 2.0 so subordinated strategy. But it's how we approach the market and particularly around how we focus our effort in new projects, and that's taken on more of a program focus. So by that, I mean, as we're looking at the areas where we -- a lot of projects we do, what we have the highest margin. We think highest ability to translate, and we're moving our resources more in that area. So I'll use medical as an example. We gave an example in the medical kind of application earlier for you guys, and we're seeing tremendous upside potential by having this machine focus a bit more. We think that's going to give us a chance as we end this year and next in spite of some pretty tough impacts of the M&A to start \u2013 there\u2019s something to be stable in our margins and hopefully, start pushing the margins up. P.J. Juvekar: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning and very nice first half of the year. Just a follow up on that last question on M&A, you reiterated that you want to do $1 billion in buybacks between now and 2020. You did $100 million this quarter. You've got great free cash flow. How do we think about the order of magnitude buybacks versus M&A for Celanese over the next couple of years? Mark Rohr : Well, they are -- I mean, they're kind of disconnected. As we outlined in May, a fair amount of excess free cash flow. And even with the $1 billion of buybacks, that was still there. So we don't see -- we don't think we have to slow down in either one of them and as probably going to steer you to higher levels in both as we're going through the next several years. Frank Mitsch : Mark, in keeping with the higher levels steering, obviously, you raised the guidance by about $1.50. According to our model, about one-third of that came in this quarter on the acetyl side of things. What are some of the assumptions for the back half of the year that have changed for you to lead to that higher guidance? Mark Rohr : Well, I think as we roll through this and we're getting everything's getting traction, I mentioned a few things that we've been able to overcome and address that have supported our higher guidance. One is that we \u2013 this machine continues to work very, very well and it's in the phase up, if I\u2019m say that, pretty steep pressure on short-term on raw materials and the energy. And so we've had to push a lot of pricing, and it's a real testament to the quality of the portfolio that we've been able to do that and not really suffer tremendously in volume or anything else. So we want to do -- in some ways, we kind of wanted that environment to really demonstrate to ourselves that we really have the power that we thought we would have and that's been the pretty good story. The ability of the industry to accept and support the kind of level of pricing that Todd and company are seeing out there has also been good. I mean, we're not seeing people run through the words, we're seeing demand stay pretty good in that. We're not seeing big substitution. I'm looking at Todd when I say that. But \u2013 so even though it seems like these are big horrific moves, from our point of view, they're not that big. It's just a combination of lots of those small things that have got us to this point. And the customer acceptability was pretty good. We're driving about $40 million year-over-year of internal price being transferred to downstream businesses. And for the first time \u2013 and I think our history, we've been able to get through to all those businesses. So we've not seen a deterioration of our margin because of recalcitrance on the parts of other markets out there accepting that drive. So those things just tell me that the level of value that we generate in this business, plus or minus a little bit, is okay, is good. And that gives us the ability to step out, and we're pretty confident of higher levels as we end this year. I'm going to roll into that. I made a comment about fourth and first. We've done a lot of work in this regard and we see, typically, 3% to 7% margin fall -- I mean, not margin, but volume falloff in the fourth quarter and also the first quarter. So think low seasonality impacts of \u2013 seasonality impacts from coatings and Chinese New Year kind of thing. And last year, we didn't have that. So Frank, I believe this year, we'll have it. It's kind of my got it. It happens almost every year. And if you roll that through, that could be maybe a $50 million kind of impact for that business if you look at a little bit of volume, a little bit of price, a little bit of turnaround in here. So that's what you see kind of baked into our numbers. So a good strong third and then a step back a bit in the fourth. And as you look at next year, I think it will be the same. We'll start a little bit slower in the business, and then I think we'll be right back into some pretty powerful levels like we've been running so far this kind of year-to-date. Frank Mitsch : So is it fair to say that you continue to expect EM to be strong, but the majority of the upside in terms of the guidance raise is more tied to some of the positives that you're seeing on the acetyls business? Mark Rohr : Yes, the EM has been a straight-line business for us and I think for our investors. We expect EM to generate the kind of numbers we thought, plus $100 million per year EBIT. And I think that's the machine we've got, and that's where we're focused on. And so I think that's going to be the real steady-eddie there that we've got. We have plenty of M&A activities there that we continue to work as well. I think the story with the chain business should really be that, hey, none of this should be a surprise to anybody, and the market receptivity to the higher valuation today has been good, which gives us confidence that that's the ability to carry on for a fair period of time. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : A question just back on acetic acid. As you look at the returns if \u2013 for new capacity for you with lower capital cost and for competitors, what's the likelihood over the next year that we get some announcements around some new greenfield or significant brownfield expansions in acetic acid? Mark Rohr : Yes. Duffy, we look out and we've kind of shared this with you guys. We shared a bit of it in May. We look out over the next several years, we're adding about 250,000 tons of capacity that Todd has underway between acetic acid and VAM. But to be very honest, it's going to be adequate, we think, for the market in the next couple of years with some of the efforts we have underway to unlock some molecules and things like that. So we think the market is probably kind of okay. When you look beyond that, though, that's the kind of stuff you should be looking at, we get the 20s, there could be the need for some incremental capacity. I don't think this business supports a full-on greenfield side with all the kind of subordinated -- I mean, secondary investments associated with doing that. So I'll be really surprised that was kind of announcement. I would, however, say from our point of view that with our cost to do a brownfield expansion, especially in Asia and some areas like that, combined with our ability to perhaps productivity justified that, in other words, the ability to shut are some other assets that aren't necessarily as economically advantaged as we'd like them all to be, then I think we have a pretty compelling story that we can perhaps put forth at that period of time. So Todd, you want to make any comments on this? Todd Elliott : Yes. I mean, that configurability, I think that's what you were referring to, I do think it's an advantage. And we'll keep looking at that and assessing the options there. As Mark mentioned, we're letting 150,000 tons of new VAM capacity in Clearlake that will start up in Q4. I was just there this week. So that's on track to be ready at the end of this quarter -- or end of this year. We have 150,000 tons on top of that on VAM through technology debottlenecks, so that will be deployed across all five VAM units. We got the first technology packages installed in Bay City, Texas. We saw that this week. That's already generating yields of around 5-plus percent on top of the output there. So that will be deployed across all five VAM units. That's 300,000 tons of additional capacity already kind of baked in and planned forward to support our 3% or 5% volume growth target that we outlined in May. And then the small step on acetic acid, 140,000 tons that we mentioned also in May, bring that on by 2020. And then back to Mark's point, we just continue to look at unique ways to consider highly configurable steps that are capital efficient and kind of marched out over time that meet the customer needs. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess, the first one, Todd, I believed in your kind of prepared remarks last night, you spoke to a quadrupling of the network activations. I guess, assuming that\u2019s essentially turning customers on, which I think that\u2019s kind of roughly what it is. I guess, can you characterize the type of relationships that those open up whether they\u2019re kind of really just, hey, look, you\u2019ve got a great global platform and when there\u2019s an issue because of an outage, we\u2019ll take on spot or if these are longer-term type relationships, I guess. How should we think about like the benefit of that conversion on these network activations? Mark Rohr : Yes. Just to recap, what these are, I mean, this is when we gather data from many, many sources around the industry, process that data and try to distill that into insights. And we have two more insights and connect that with what we believe is the leading network, acetyls network of the industry. We operate that network, look for option that emerge out of that and then activate something. So that could be a combination of things in the second quarter with 250 activations versus about 50 last year, most of those were price activations, right? That\u2019s where most of those were. So that\u2019s a combination of working out there in multiple geographies, multiple product lines, many, many different cases, different customers to activate different price changes in the quarter. There were several on the supply side, frankly, that within our own network and moderating, increasing, changing, shifting our own network to produce more or less depending on the region as well. The other piece there is on the supply chain side. So this is a combination of sourcing or moving product from region A, B or C to best serve our global customers and also take sort of the best network-optimized movements to support our business. So these can move around. They can be different sources or different types of activation, depending on what\u2019s going on. But it really is supported by the broadest network that we believe is out there and really working those nodes and working those degrees of freedom to help the business generate value. Scott Richardson : John, I think the way I would kind of characterize this, too, is that we\u2019re students of our own business model and we\u2019re students of the industry. And we put this in place \u2013 Todd, Steve put this in place as a method of really assessing our effectiveness and really creating opportunities in finding opportunities and acting on this opportunity. So we can measure the effectiveness of that. And it\u2019s been a really good process for us, because what we found is that we can, as we can increase our degrees of freedom. We can enhance further our opportunities to drive profit. And so whether that\u2019s different logistic systems in places, contractual arrangements, whatever those things might be, it just gives us a chance to continue to support this market. And we think a very positive way for our customers with a lot of degrees of optionality to give them the best product at the right time at the market-competitive price for them. And so that\u2019s been the work we\u2019ve done. John McNulty : Got it, okay. That\u2019s definitely helpful. And then I guess another question, I guess, I know you said in terms of the tariffs, it sounds like there\u2019s really not a lot of exposure there. I guess, one question I had, though, with all the noise around the tariffs and with all the end markets that you indirectly end up touching. Have you seen any demand-related reactions from some of the tariff noise, that\u2019s out there particularly in China? Is it having any impact in terms of how kind of the end customers for your products react or are consuming the products right now? Or are you too far away from kind of the end customer to actually see it at this point? Mark Rohr : No, it\u2019s having \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s actually having zero impact \u2013 a company like ours, there\u2019s no impact. On our customers, there\u2019s no impact. And it\u2019s not even a subject of discussion. I think if you\u2019re Harley-Davidson and you\u2019re selling 70,000 bikes into Europe, and its $2,500 charge per bike then you\u2019re talking $70 million, $80 million, whatever the number is \u2013 that\u2019s an impact. But that\u2019s not our business model. So I think this is a political charade, to some extent. I mean, you\u2019ve got leaders of countries kind of badmouthing one another over it one another over it. But perhaps speaking from a commercial point of view, we don\u2019t see nor do I think many multinationals, which see huge impact of this swirling around. That\u2019s my kind of spin on that. Again, unless you are very succinct, very focused, one product line that may \u2013 you get with no ability to produce outside the U.S. maybe I\u2019d see that\u2019s a little bit. So no, we don\u2019t see it as a big deal. John McNulty : Great, thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you, good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, John. David Begleiter : Mark, on Acetate Tow, can you give us an update on any strategic options you\u2019re pursuing here? And is that still a very high priority? Or is it may be less a priority given the performance of the rest of the businesses? Mark Rohr : Well, I mean, I won\u2019t give you any direct color. We continue to look for ways to make sure that business hits stable earnings, and we\u2019ve had a good first half of this year with regard to that. We\u2019ll be flat year-over-year, so you can do the math on that. We\u2019ll be down a little bit in the second \u2013 the next two quarters, which is pretty typical for that business being front end-loaded. So our view is really how in the next year we keep this business flat, 2018, 2019 and 20,000. The Ocotlan shutdown was a piece of that. It gives us a chunk of that $50 million that we were going after to cushion that business, but it\u2019s only a chunk. Our first priority is to continue to focus in and take those steps necessarily \u2013 necessary for us to self-generate that $50 million of cover that we think this business needs to make sure it\u2019s flat as we go through these next three years. That\u2019s the highest priority, David, where we spend most of our energy and effort. Second to that is we continue to look for ways to work with others to unlock additional synergies, and we\u2019ve not reached a point we can talk about any of those yet. And I\u2019ll use the secondary kind of consideration for us is not \u2013 certainly, not the end of the world if those don\u2019t work out, but we\u2019re hopeful we can find a way for those to work out. The last thing I\u2019d say it strategically, is very much our strategy to make this topic de minimis. And we want to do that not by reducing earnings, but by maintaining earnings and also then growing business elsewhere. So it\u2019s becoming a smaller and smaller portion of our free cash flow. And if you set aside the dividend from China, which in itself is pretty secure, we think for a very long period of time, you\u2019re getting out of business that\u2019s certainly less than $200 million of contribution and what\u2019s going to be well over $2 billion of EBITDA this year. So we think we\u2019re hitting all three of those in the right direction. John Babcock : And Mark, you touched this earlier, but in terms of these high prices in acid and VAM, you mentioned no demand disruption or substitution yet, but are you concerned at some point it might be some? And what level do you think that might occur? Mark Rohr : Well, I think what I would \u2013 the way characterize this is I don\u2019t think the price is very high. I think it\u2019s adequate. And as I said, because if you look at it from a point of view of the average producer out there, they\u2019re not making our margins even today. Methanol is north of 400, maybe 500 in China. Coal prices are up in yada yada yada. These guys are not raking in tons and tons of profit. And we\u2019ve seen recently that the bad debts out there in China and the negative consequences of these enterprises, these big state-run enterprises failing is pretty horrific. We -- so the first position I think it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not that hard. It\u2019s what it should be kind of level. We\u2019ve not seen any indication and don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any real going to be an impact on consumptive materials, if you look at the role that acetic acid as a derivative plays in product gains, it\u2019s kind of de minimis. Higher oil prices, I think, directionally helps us, David, I\u2019ll say that. So yes, if oil prices drop back to $20 a barrel or something horrific like that, then that -- then you could get some substitution to oil basis again maybe. But I think in the sweet spot we\u2019re in now, which is low $60 to $80 coal under the pressure it\u2019s under, the fact that from a grassroots basis, there\u2019s not -- still not a lot of great return in this business, we think we\u2019re kind of in a pretty sweet spot we should stay there for some period of time. And I don\u2019t really see a lot that would knock us materially off of that. John Babcock : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Sure, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. In the Engineered Materials segment, is there a way to think about how much of the raw material inflation is just transfer pricing from the acetyl segment? And how much is external pressure that you\u2019re facing? Todd Elliott : Yes, John, I would characterize this is almost all external pressure. So there\u2019s not a lot of transfer price impact in EM from the upstream side. John Roberts : Okay. And then is there a way to think about the contribution of network activations to the acetyl segment? Is there sort of a base level of fee income or a base level of margin contribution that you think that provides above which then we have just the market ups and downs on top of that? Mark Rohr : No, John. It\u2019s a no. Its not, I mean, a lot of these indirectly will have zero contribution for just sort of one activity. But it has -- it avoids something on one end. So we don\u2019t break those down by dollar per nodal activity contribution. John Roberts : Okay, thank you. Mark Rohr : Sure, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Laurence. Laurence Alexander : Two questions. One, on Engineered Materials, can you discuss whether the average project sizes are getting bigger or smaller or if there\u2019s any particular trend in how customers are responding to your initiatives? Are they giving you different types of problems? But also just back to the question about the bridge for 2019, you often have -- or in years past, you\u2019ve had multiple levers that you could pull the sort of try and keep roughly on, call it, a 10% kind of CAGR. In the back half of the year, you\u2019ll be at about $10 run rate. Is that the way to think about the business? And then you may be hit the fly ups? Or do you see enough sort of internal levers to pull that acetyls profit can be flat year-over-year in 2019? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think what I\u2019d like to say on that is that I don\u2019t want to not answer your question, but I\u2019m kind of going to do that, Laurence. We\u2019re already looking hard at next year. That\u2019s from a seasonality point of view, it\u2019s a little bit out of schedule. And we\u2019ll get into next quarter and next quarter\u2019s call, we\u2019re going to drive that call to next year. Having said all of that, when we look at the increase in year-over-year, this modest increase in Todd\u2019s business, I think what you\u2019re going to see this year is, you\u2019ve had a strong front end and a little bit weaker back end of it, which is really driven most prominently by, I think, seasonality rolling in like historically it normally does, plus the big VAM turnaround outage and things like that. It\u2019s going to impact us in the fourth quarter. And I think you\u2019ll see a similar kind of start. So next year is going to maybe a little bit more back end-loaded than front end-loaded, if I could say that. But when I look at it again, I\u2019ll just simply say that I don\u2019t think if you build it from the base up, I don\u2019t think coal is going to change in China. I don\u2019t think the environmental regulation is going to change in that part of the world. I don\u2019t think methanol is going to materially change with arbitrage is available between coal, methanol and ethylene there. So I think that fundamental raw material and demand based of that business is going to stay the same. From a consumer demand, Todd lay that out, I think, with a lot of specificity in May. We\u2019ve never seen that move around a whole lot. So whether that\u2019s 2% or 3%, it kind of doesn\u2019t necessarily matter a lot in the scheme of things. And so our business is going to run between 85% and 90% capacity utilization moving overtime towards 90%. So I think in the period of time where we\u2019re getting out I think it\u2019s a long period of time of very good business with the kind of profitability levels we use to see back in the mid-2000. So in early 2000s is what I think we\u2019re in for. And so there should not be any reason for us not to be able to continue to grow earnings with that early over this period of time. But again, if it\u2019s 30% going to 33%, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same as we have in 9, 10, 11. I think it could be a little bit flatter next year than that 9, 10 or 11 would projected for us in our Strategy 3.0 rollout. Todd Elliott : Yes. And just to take your first question, Laurence, about our project size, I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear. Our sweet spot is in the few hundred thousand dollar range in terms of projects, and we\u2019re not seeing that materially changing. The power of our model is being really disciplined in the types of projects that we work on. And if things get too small, the potential value of us putting efforts there becomes de minimis. On the flip side of that, larger projects tend to be a bigger lift to be successful. And so, we're very focused on improving our win rate and so we\u2019re keeping our project size kind of in the area where we've proven successful is critically important for us. Laurence Alexander : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you very much. Two questions; first, just quickly do you have organic volume number for engineering materials this quarter? Mark Rohr : No, we don't. And in broadly speaking, we think that half of our volume growth is organic and half of it is through M&A in that process. And we don't parse that \u2013 there is no part of that equation if we're going to \u2013 Vince if we\u2019re going to parse out, I'll have to give you how much material we lose in terms of leakage, volumetric leakage that occurs in this business, which is not linear. But if you think of a little thumb of 50 :50 is as good as when you get with it. Vincent Andrews : Okay, very good. And then just in the acetic chain, I'm just trying to understand sort of the bridge sequentially because I see sales were down, but obviously the profit was up, so that implies some type of cost benefits. So it was just a question of lower ethylene contract prices being a little bit stickier? Or what sort of is the dynamic that allowed that to play out? Mark Rohr : I think we're checking that a little bit. You're talking about the first quarter to second quarter or second quarter to end of the year? What\u2026 Vincent Andrews : Sorry, first quarter to second quarter, your sales are down in 2Q versus 1Q, but your profits are up. So I'm just trying to understand what happened on the cost line? Todd Elliott : Yeah, I would focus on the price side as being really the major contributor to our earnings performance in the second quarter. I mean that's \u2013 really the story is the combination of utilization rates, pricing, margin increase, loss are relatively flat frankly and have been \u2013 most of the year. We had some turnaround activity in there in Q2 that wasn't in Q1 that may be part of that\u2019s driving that. Vincent Andrews : Okay, alright, so nothing in particular. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks a lot, just wanted to clarify on acetyls here. You've entered kind of your level of earnings power in the business, and it sounds like you do see kind of a positive supply-demand balance for the next several years. So, I guess, are you actually expecting earnings to kind of continue at this level in trajectory? And what would be kind of one or two swing factors or two or three swing factors that would prevent that from happening? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Well, these are big volume businesses, probably around the world, so it can\u2019t move day to day in that process. What we said in May is that we think this was a 20% margin business and [indiscernible] things and that's still what we kind of believe. We believe we're in the three-year period. We're going to be averaging that 20 maybe discussion above that through that period of time. But certainly, you can go through a short-term swing if raw material prices will be spiked up or will sales fall off. You could find yourself move around a little bit, but we think yes, we think we reset that margin from mid-teens level to a 20% level. And we don't see a reason why that 20% level, and that's our margin, not industry margin. We don't see why that level shouldn't be \u2013 shouldn\u2019t exist throughout this three-year period. And we believe we can set the stage for that to continue beyond that period through a series of smart investments and cooperative support agreements we can put in place. So we're pretty comfortable that this business is going to stay pretty tight for a fairly long period of time. Arun Viswanathan : Great and on the \u2013 the earnings trajectory over the next several years, so if you expect this to kind of remain in a similar level, would you be in a position to use capital deployment whether it\u2019s in the form of buybacks or M&A to kind of keep you on that trajectory of 10% or 12% earnings growth? And on that note, I mean, you highlighted some potential debt capacity at your Investor Day, if you further thought about that and deploying\u2026 Mark Rohr : I'll make a few comments and I'll let Scott Richardson as well to step in here. But yes, when you look at it, we don't have any pulse rate in terms of anxiety about whether we can predict earnings, so that you have to agree like I think all you guys would like us do. We're just focused on generating earnings and we'll happily trade-off what we need to do on the process of period to period to make that sort of happen on a gross basis. What I will look at this as a view that we think this business is \u2013 we said a bit sooner than we anticipated, probably advancing it by nine months or so, what we kind of anticipated in our three-year plan. So we think that if you look at out there in 2020, we'll be closer to 12 than 11 in that number. So we think this profit is going to, for the most part, stay with us through that period of time, but it could ebb and flow a little bit as we go through that period. I don't know if I'm fully answering your question. But I think for us we feel like whether it's $30 cumulative over that three-year period, or $33 cumulative, it's kind of flipping about it\u2019s kind of been different to us. We think there is going to be a period of very, very good and strong, solid earnings, and we'll do our best to project for you just how that's going to flow as we get further along. Scott Richardson : Yes, I would just add, I mean, it's critically important for us to be disciplined stewards of how we utilize that cash flow. And we have a prioritization of uses of cash that we really stick to and organic growth in our business has been first and looking at attractive investment, second. And then being very consistent, being consistent increaser of the dividend and then of buying back shares. And depending on the timing some of that cash flow and where the M&A pipeline is there may be times at which we fluctuate on the levels that we deploy in each of those areas. But that's really kind of how we look at it strategically. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And last one is just you discussed the possibility of methanol investment. Maybe you can just discuss that further. And also your possibility of potentially separating the businesses, is there still a large dis-synergy component that you will be concerned about? Or are you working to minimize that? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Yes I think the real key for us in all of our investments \u2013 for all of our businesses, is can we make sure that we're not withholding cash for any business in that process. And I'm happy to say we've never done that certainly since I've been here at Celanese. As we look forward, there could be more organic growth opportunities surfacing in the chain business that it could well serve it to be a separate entity versus a combined entity. That's not an eminent issue for us or topic. But we see this business is having lots of opportunity to in theory seek investments either directly or with partnership shoot ups to grow at scope around the world and better position itself to keep his earnings growth underway without regard for a subtle change in asset price in China. So I think you should expect us in the month and quarters ahead to talk more about organic growth and organic growth opportunities in that process. I think likewise we're seeing \u2013 continuing to see \u2013 you know it's been a few months since we closed the deal, we\u2019re continuing to see plenty of opportunities in EM. And those organic investments are also very important for us and very important for our investors to keep that business growing at the pace it's been on. So what I'll just tell you here is that our intention to fund both of those things and make sure we fund them. We think we can do that today we've been able to do that very well. It\u2019s been a combined entity at some point. If we couldn't do that as a combined entity, we would be separate entity. So we\u2019ll make sure we maximize shareholder value. Arun Viswanathan : Yes, thanks. Mark Rohr : So that is the methanol, just a direct comment on methanol. Methanol continues to have an attractive play for us. I think the concept of methanol, though I would patriate more as we get to looking it additions to acetic acid. When they're appropriate down the road methanol could be a piece of that either independently with us doing it, with somebody else doing it or as a partnership. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Mark Rohr : Sure. Surabhi Varshney : Brendon we\u2019ll take one last question and then wrap up the call. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. Mark, dating back to your Investor Day, I think, you said at that time in early May that you're exploring multiple options for a new world-scale ascetic plant. Realize it's only been 2.5 months, but can you provide an update there? Is that still an active ambition on your part? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think what will be of interest to us is doing it in a way that I'm not dependent on new volume growth to satisfy. We would like \u2013 we always like to do things in a way that the productivity contribution made by this investment is sufficient to carry the investment. So Todd is working hard to find ways and options to create scenarios where we can expand in a way that from a market point of view is incremental, from an internal point of view that's great in our return is not solely dependent on what the gross market is doing. So yes, it's still of keen interest to us, Kevin. And we're working hard. So as soon as we get to a point where we have more detail to share, we'll do that. Kevin McCarthy : And finally, the risk of beating a dead horse, I want to come back to acetyls and kind of the cyclical move that we\u2019re \u2013 anyway the move we've seen there, how would you characterize that business relative to your view of normalized earnings power? Normally, when earnings double, let's say EBITDA, in your case has doubled broadly over the last two to three years. And you've got a nine handle in the first half on the operating rate. Things start to feel pretty full. On the other hand, you described price is adequate and you've pointed to some interesting and unusual environmental restrictions in China that really could have some legs. And so I guess, I'm trying to parse out is the current level more of a new normal in your view or above normal? How would you characterize that? Mark Rohr : Well, I certainly think that the period that we went through, the 2012 to 2016 period is abnormal. It was abnormal as it reflected the sustain investment in China, in particular, and all these assets and just the crumbling of capacity utilization. And the way we do with any business, it gets pretty \u2013 it just gets goofy. And so we have a lot of volatility in earnings and those things. I would say through that period of time though, Kevin, we were able to predict, I think pretty accurately, where we are. So we see these changes as not being unusual. I know that may seem flippant to you guys, but we predicted this would happen, we've talked a lot about it in every \u2013 back in 2015, we talked about it. What we missed I think was probably six or seven months. And that's what we missed and \u2013 or eight months. But it wasn't \u2013 we didn't miss it. So I think in a period where this business is healthy, that's how I describe it. I don't think it's overpriced or it's overamped. It's healthy. And I\u2019d say it because I think if you look at the largest market in the world in China. It's still a marginal business for them. I mean, it's not \u2013 I mean, it's certainly profitable at today's rate, but it's not crazy profitable. It's probably not even in the Chinese market today given the costs associated with it and the environmental concern is even attractive economically for them to reinvest. So we think that's a healthy place and a natural place for us to be. And so yes, I do expect this to change as we communicated them in May. And I do think this was a \u2013 for us, a 20% margin kind of business. And I think in the Asian\u2019s markets, its low teens to mid-teens. I mean, I think that's what you've got, 500 or 600 basis points \u2013 700 basis points we have between their world and our world. So I think yes, I think we're going to be here plus or minus a little bit for some period of time. Kevin McCarthy : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Sure. Surabhi Varshney : We will now conclude the call. Thank you all for your questions and for listening in this morning. We are available after the call to address any further questions you may have. Please close the call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Also this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Surabhi Varshney : Thank you, Anita. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. My name is Surabhi Varshney, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Sutton, Chief Operating Officer. Today\u2019s presentation includes statements about expectations for the future results and plans that are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from such statements. And additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ can be found in the posted materials. We will also discuss non-GAAP measures today. You can find information related to these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures on our website in the Investor Relations section. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials are available on the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system. Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter 2018 earnings release via Business Wire and posted slides and remarks about the quarter in the Investor Relations section of our website after market close. Since we published our comments yesterday we will now open the lines for your questions. Operator : We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi. Mark Rohr : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Every week I get some kind of price increase announcement from Celanese in acetyls. So my question is, how are your paint coatings and polyester fiber customers taking this price increases? And I guess, you\u2019ve been leading the market in acetyls, if there is new capacity that comes in, would that sort of upset the apple cart in terms of the discipline? Mark Rohr : Hi, P.J. This is Mark. Thanks. Let me back up a little bit. I think there\u2019s over the years people have kind of you know made fun of our price increases, but we did that for a reason, a very specific reason. When you deal with customers, my personal experience is customers don't mind pricing. They just don't want to be disadvantaged or surprised. We go to great lengths to very openly share what's going on in the market and how we're responding do that and with great lengths working with individual, with customers help them moderate and manage and deal with those price increases. So broadly speaking, that's why you see us do what we do and because of that we have found that our customers always respond well to what we do and I mean sometimes, it's tough, but they always respond well. We've not seen any unusual pushback or anything else from pricing and if you look at the level of inflation, we're seeing that P.J. you've been going around a few years, you've seen lots of cycles at inflation, it\u2019s not that severe. There are different areas where it's hitting us, but it's not unusual nor is it anything that few years ago we didn't see in a routine kind of basis with multi-hundred million dollar year-over-year kind of the raw material inflation number. So, I know there's a lot of worry about that out there, but I don't quite -- I can't quite quantify it and I don\u2019t know why people are so concerned about it. You got to work hard to stay ahead. We do. We work properly with our customers, but we haven't seen any particular issue with it. And I roll it back to say as you relate to polyester, no big issue, no big issue there. P.J. Juvekar: Yeah, don't get me wrong. We appreciate your price increases and admire that you are able to raise pricing and recover raws. Mark Rohr : Yeah. No I didn't take it that way. I just want to make sure, that people understand that, that we do that, but we're a bit more public than others, but we would do that on purpose and we do it for a reason and it\u2019s really just to focus in and help our customers. P.J. Juvekar: Right. And then just Mark, good question on your guidance for 2019. You mentioned that gains in EM engineered materials would be offset by winter seasonality. I was wondering if you can just explain what do you mean by winter seasonality? Thank you. Mark Rohr : Well it\u2019s -- thank you, PJ.. Those of you that have followed things like the coating businesses in China for a while, understand that you go through these seasonality kind of periods. And classically, in our business segments, you would have weaker winter seasons or fall seasons fourth quarters and weaker first quarters and that varies between would vary between coatings businesses in Europe, Chinese New Year, seasonality and auto builds. So a lot of things that kind of roll into that generically. It's not a big deal. It is just a natural kind of event that would occur similar to week sales in Europe in August. It is something that happened. So, what we saw last year though which is a bit unique is we didn't see -- we didn't see that. We kind of powered through first and forth and there were a lot of subtle reasons why that is. We believe that we're returning to that kind of normal movement. So, again it's not a big deal other than the fact that we didn't have it this year as we started the year. So, that's all we're saying there. That means that fundamentally we would see our -- over the next several years, we'd see is have stronger middle -- mid-cycle earnings year than in end of cycle, beginning at the end of the year. That's all it means P.J. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Zekauskas : Hi good morning. I noticed in your AI business that your volumes were lower sequentially and my memory was you had all kinds of outages in the second quarter. So, why were your volumes sequentially weaker? Scott Sutton : Yeah. So, hi Jeff, this is Scott Sutton. Look I mean, we don't worry too much about sequential volumes win as you know we run a model there when we go out and activate our network. So, sometimes we're in stronger in a certain derivative and sometimes we're out of that. You really have to think about the whole year for the health of the business and for the whole year even volumes in that business will increase. Jeff Zekauskas : No, you will - it's a very tight market. So, and you had a very strong year-over-year pricing and you had very good sequential pricing. So, were you trying to maximize the profitability of the model in the third quarter? Mark Rohr : We always try to do budget, every minute of the day we try to do that. And we're, we\u2019re in the market in quite a few hundred thousand tons per year in terms of bio resell, in that process. It wasn't necessarily unusual this quarter, that activity but maybe a little bit more unusual. But yeah we always try to make good decisions to maximize the profit for our shareholders. Scott Sutton : Yeah. And Jeff I mean I would really encourage you to think about the whole varsity of change from a volume standpoint, not just what\u2019s shown as the AI segment and think about that on an annual basis as well. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Robert Koort : I don\u2019t know for you or Surabhi or Scott, but I thought the comprehensive review you guys put out was excellent and it helps answer a ton of questions ahead of time and I really appreciate limiting your formal conference call remarks to none so we can ask questions. I wish all companies would approach it the same way. Let me ask my two questions if I could. First on, I guess for Scott on -- Sutton, on the EM model do you guys feel it's more of a product's expertise or process expertise and I guess the question is really aimed at can you bring in other, can you start going maybe down the pyramid to more commoditized or maybe less specialized plastics but employ the same process for the same success or do you think it's limited by the types of products that you sell through EM. Mark Rohr : Well Bob, I mean really the real intellectual property in that business is the model right, now how that manifest itself is being able to go out and match up our broadest solution set to the largest number of customer needs. I mean clearly, we do well where there's a little bit more sophistication needed, right, by customers, but that also applies to what I'll call mid and lower range products as well, it's not exclusive only to those super sophisticated products. Robert Koort : Got you. Okay. And then I thought you had a very interesting point about your auto demand relative to auto builds. Can you give us any sense from the outside how we can try to predict and calibrate your growth in that market, when it seems to be so detached from OEM build rates? Mark Rohr : Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bob you know even across \u2013 across all markets, right, where we\u2019re not necessarily dependent on absolute growth of the driver volumes in this business. But you've got to be able to think about sophisticated solutions and sometimes when volumes are declining like they did in auto in the \u2013 in the third quarter, there's actually a bigger drop for unique solutions for cost savings or whatever it is from the customer. So I can't give you a way to connect to that. What I will just say is that, we grew every single market segment and that's the plan going forward as well. Robert Koort : Great. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Okay. Thanks, Bob. Operator : The next question comes from John P. McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Look, there's been a \u2013 there's been a lot of movement in the \u2013 do you see the gas prices in the middle year. We get that you guys don't naturally trade on spot. But I guess, how are you thinking about, how pricing moves as we get into the fourth quarter and into 2019 and as far as 2019 goes when you think about year-over-year, can it be up, flat I guess, how are you thinking about it? Mark Rohr : Not a lot, but it\u2019s what I would say, John. We work in that market to try to -- I mean with all the molecules to try the mark the net value back to our corporation. Classically you would see a drift down in pricing a bit and pour off a bit in the first. And we certainly started seeing a little bit of that but that \u2013 there\u2019s been announcements by local Chinese companies actually driving pricing back higher in China, which is a bit unusual. So we -- Kevin, I guess I\u2019d say we stop thinking about it too much. We think more about normal seasonality, and normal seasonality would say there won\u2019t be a little bit off in the fourth and little bit off in the first, stronger in the middle quarter. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re kind of looking at this normalized view year-over-year rather than in absolute dollar per term price. So Scott do you have any further thoughts on that? Scott Richardson : Yeah, Mark. I mean I would just add that the way pricing comes about is by the number of activations we\u2019re able to do to our network. And you\u2019ve seen us increase that metal increase next year. And underlying all of that is fundamentals are still okay, effective utilization is still okay. So if you put those two things together I think it\u2019s an okay situation. John McNulty : Got it. Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow-up. You\u2019d indicated in your I guess your outlook for 2019 that there were going to be potentially some I guess the cost of some several large plan to outages. I guess how should we be thinking about you know the I guess the delta or the bogie between 2019 and 2018 in terms of -- Scott Richardson : About $50 million, about $50 million. So there\u2019s \u2013 we have a huge internal turnaround, where we\u2019re expanding the rebuilding from an efficiency point of view, one of our POM assets in Ibn Sina. That's a very, very large turnaround and those are quite expensive. John McNulty : Great. Thanks very much. Scott Richardson : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. With regard to Engineered Materials, you\u2019ve put forth a goal of having 5,000 projects in 2020. Can you speak to two aspects? First, how do you expect the average project size to trend between now and then? And then second, what sort of level of acquisition activity do you need or not need to achieve that level? Mark Rohr : Yeah. Go ahead. Scott Sutton : So, Kevin, this is Scott Sutton. In terms of size of average project, I mean that's going to trend where it's been trending in the last couple of years, right. We are going to increase the number of projects that we close or get a purchase order for taking it up to 5,000 by 2020. We do have some assumption of one or two bolt-ons a year between now and then that helps add to that pipeline. Most of it comes through organic growth though. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And second question if I may on capital deployment. You raised your 2020 earnings goal to $12, up from I think $11 at the time of your Investor Day in May. Can you update us on what amount of capital deployment is embedded there? And my recollection is that it was excluding repurchases, but inclusive of some bolt-on acquisitions and I guess related to that your press release indicates an ability to accelerate repurchases. Obviously the market has been shall we say a little choppy. And what are your latest thoughts on that subject? Scott Richardson : Yeah. Kevin, this is Scott Richardson. So what we said in Investor Day was that we expected CapEx to be in the $350 million range for the next three years. We\u2019re going to probably come in around $330 million this year just with the timing of how it flows through. But we made the announcement on the POM expansion, we have several other very attractive productivity and growth-driven projects that we're looking at. So we're actually expecting that as we get to the end of that three-year window that CapEx will actually tick up higher than that $350 million level we\u2019ll probably be kind of in that range maybe plus or minus a little bit next year but we should be up to higher levels beginning in 2020 and beyond. And that should just translate to continued earnings growth again through productivity and top line growth going forward. And then on repurchases, yeah, our cash flows been very strong this year. We stated this quarter that we expect to approach $1.2 billion of free cash flow and so we do have the opportunity just given where the market has been to accelerate some of those repurchases that we had originally stated, we had said we were going to do a $1 billion over the three-year period from 2018 to 2020. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. Mark Rohr : Kevin, this is Mark. Just real quick on two of those topics, it's a bit of a add-on to what Scott has said. I don't know that we've really explained well enough the opportunities that we have to incrementally expand our assets, and in most cases, Kevin, we can get a phenomenally term with no incremental volume which we have enough productivity opportunities in front of us. And I know that's a little bit hard to conceptualize but when you have a global network of assets and you're playing in a number of different fields as it relates to raw material values across energy cost, logistics cost today which are up over $60 million over two-year period corporately for company like ours. There is tremendous value that can be created that way. And so, we have a series of those that we're evaluating and seeing up you\u2019ve seen some of those announcements that are giving returns from the 25% to 45% kind of range largely independent of material volume there. So, you should expect more capital going into that. And so, we haven\u2019t put out a number yet we\u2019ll I think predominantly maybe, more January Scott on kind of what we see out there but certainly near-term that 350 kind of number is fine, but as we get out the 2020 timeframe may be its higher than that. Getting back to cash we've reported this ability to press would be roughly around $1.2 billion this year. So, you would expect that to grow as we go out to the next couple of years. We\u2019ve targeted $3.6 million. We're going to work hard to see it\u2019s higher than that, we think even a constant earnings we have the ability to kick out more cash. So, we're going to look for find the ways to invest that cash in phenomenal opportunities for us. We're staying on bolt-on acquisitions, but we think, we\u2019ll be able to finance yet pretty easily with the cash coming off the business and then beyond that we'll look to make sure, that our dividend policy reflects our much higher level of cash flow in the share repurchase and accelerating those as Scott had said. Kevin McCarthy : I appreciate the additional color. Operator : The next question -- Mark Rohr : Anita, could you do that again please? Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts. Please go ahead John. John Roberts : Great. Thank you. Could you update us on any progress in replacing your filter tow deal that you have with Blackstone with an alternative transaction of some sort? Mark Rohr : We're still working on that, John. It's not a lot of options out there. We haven't found one yet. I remain convinced as that\u2019s Scott and Scott that there are opportunities for us to do things out there may be more structurally based on our manufacturing, but we're working hard to try to find opportunities. John Roberts : Is there any risk for a second inventory correction in filter tow given the sort of general weakness in China or do you think inventories are low enough there that we don't have that risk right now? Mark Rohr : We're pretty comfortable in inventory levels were fine. We don't see that as being the risk, we've been a team that's been active on trying to drop pricing in the world. We have some traction with that which is good. And then of course, we need that to offset some of the volume declines that are naturally occurring in the business, not dramatic, but that normal 2% per year. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning, David. David Begleiter : Just on China, are you seeing some signs of slowing or softening in the economy. And just on these winter shutdowns, I think in your prepared comments suggests that they might be even more severe than this year, but I mean perhaps they could be less severe than last year due to the need to stimulate the economy. Give us comment on that? Mark Rohr : Well, I think all three of us here would have slightly different version of it. So I think I'll give my spin, and then Sutton and Richardson can follow. But I mean if you read publication, China\u2019s coming up reporting a little bit lower numbers. For those of us that have had to make a living out of China for a long time. We never \u2013 that\u2019s how we believe the prior numbers anyway. So, I don't know quite what to read of whether 6.5% growth or 7.5% growth myself. From my point of view we don\u2019t see any dramatic slowing in China. And we can say guys is that fair But, yeah? Scott Sutton : Yeah. I mean this Scott Sutton. I mean our project pipeline is increasing nicely in China... Mark Rohr : Yeah. Scott Sutton : In fact and that's where a good bit of the growth has come from even, even in the last quarter in China. And half the deals we've been able to make a lot more moves or activations as well, so it's really quite active. Mark Rohr : So, so if there is a slowdown occurring I think it's occurring in a thoughtful way in a way that actually enhances commerce. Doesn't detract from commerce or a place to our business model strengths, I mean another way of seeing it, out there clearly. Absolute dollar sales has gone down, but the need to dramatically improve the quality of all those is kind of off the chart. So, so we've not \u2013 we just don't quite feel it, is what I would say. David Begleiter : Got it. And mark just on your M&A pipeline, I know you acquired Next Polymers announced that. How's the rest of the M&A pipeline looking for this year and even next year? Mark Rohr : Scott you want? Scott Sutton : Yeah. David, I would say that we still have a healthy pipeline particularly in Engineered Materials and there's good opportunity to do some meaningful bolt-ons next year. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Scott Sutton : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey good morning. Nice quarter there. Mark Rohr : Thanks, Mike. Mike Sison : Mark, in terms of auto just curious how much left is there to do in a car. I mean is there a lot of opportunity to continue to convert parts and plastics and what are you converting now and what\u2019s the opportunity do you think over the next couple of years. Mark Rohr : Yeah, it\u2019s infinite. I mean what\u2019s the car of the future is going to look like, is \u2013 probably going to be extruded hard to guess. I mean so no, we see I mean you can only imagine the You can only imagine them the thousands of connections, the thousands of discrete parts that go into autos, each one plays an intrinsic role and the quality of that vehicle, the aesthetics of that vehicle, the efficacy of that vehicle, the fuel efficiency of it, and what the other dealers are always doing is trading off those value equations. The price of steel is not constant, the price of aluminum is not constant. So you're always getting into a refinement removing of that alleged vacation is really exciting for us not only in the lithium energy packets pack alone but the housing for that, the connectors that are going in that, the design of the new consoles for this vehicles, the reduced weight which dramatically expands the application of reinforced on the plastics and in structural parts. So it's \u2013 and I'm sure there is a limit to it but I kind of don't know what it is. Mike Sison : Okay. Great. And then, when I think about the 2020 outlook for the segments you know that Acetyl Chain seems to be pretty much there, can you maybe walk us through some of the upside potential over the next couple of years there, and maybe downside as well? Mark Rohr : Well, the upside potential of that business really is volume. You got an industry that's running in the mid-80% capacity utilization that has a history of losing on average three production assets per year, if you look at kind of the run rate of upsets in this business it's \u2013 the average is pretty close to really world-scale assets per year are out. So think about 1.5 million tons out of a 16 million ton, 17 million ton, 18 million ton market. Last year we were probably 2.2, 2.3 something like that, so it\u2019s a little bit unusually high from that point of view but that that 100 year storm last year happens every three years, four years, five years. So we think we're in a period where the business is going to be tight. We also think that the loose monetary policy of China which will led to the one negative cycle we had in this business is gone and I think been gone for good with the Blue Sky campaign but also the need to get a return on your investment and frankly the inability of China to compete outside of China. So we see ourselves moving from one dip that lasted a long time to one upcycle that\u2019s going to last a very long time. And for us it's going to be solid pricing incremental volume growth. It\u2019s all -- Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys, good morning. Mark Rohr : Hey, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, Mark. Just to expand on that last point. So you noted Acetyl capacity utilization in the mid-80s on a global basis in 2018. Do you expect that to get higher in 2019 or stay around the same? It just seems like things were a bit tighter in 2018 given some industry disruptions and force majeures. I'm just trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about 2019 specifically. Mark Rohr : Well, when we do these kind of things, we don't really fantasize about things on the fringe that could happen. So we kind of look at it as being pretty similar to this. I mean demand will creep up a little bit, but we're doing like a slight incremental expansion. Others may be doing a little push down more volumes. So we think it's going to stay for the most part in the mid-80s, maybe creep a one turn or something. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then on the EM segment, operating margins inflected higher year-over-year for 3Q after several quarters of declines due to both high raw material costs and also some of the initial dilution from acquisitions. Looking back at 2016 margins were sort of in the mid-30s range for that segment, when do you think you can get back to those types of levels or is the mix of the business just different versus back then? Scott Sutton : Yeah. I mean this is Scott Sutton. Look, I think where we\u2019re operating right now particularly this most recent quarter is like a good healthy place for that business to be, because we can grow it at that level, we can add on bolt-on acquisitions and life their margins up and really add a lot of value to the company. To me, it\u2019s healthy where it is. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thank you. Scott Sutton : Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Please go ahead. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Mark Rohr : Good morning. Arun Viswanathan : I guess just wanted to understand maybe the raw materials picture. There was some increase in some of the feedstocks over less than a while. Would that have any impact on you guys going forward given your ethylene purchases? Mark Rohr : Ethylene specifically -- on ethylene, yeah, look I mean -- okay, I\u2019ll answer it more broadly. Okay. I\u2019ll answer it more broadly. I mean the reality is if you look at third quarter every single business, right energy and raws went up every single business really we\u2019re able to cover that off with price. So look I mean we could feel somewhat impacts from that, but I think we\u2019re set up to completely cover that up. Arun Viswanathan : And then, just kind of just understanding the three-year outlook on an earnings basis, what kind of cash deployment do you have in there and how\u2019s that split bit between buybacks and acquisitions? Mark Rohr : Yeah. I mean like we said we have a $1 billion earmarked for buybacks at this point in time and we will bring some of that forward in front loaded. We will continue to deploy cash back into the business as our first choice through organic investment. And we had earmarked $1 billion and we said that may take a little higher than that towards the back end of these three years. And then on acquisitions we\u2019ve said about a $1 billion for acquisitions over the same period. So, no, we haven\u2019t done on a regular basis but this year we haven't done at that level but, as Scott said, we have some attractive things that we see potentially coming next year. Arun Viswanathan : Right. Is there capacity to increase those given the over $3 billion that you could generate over three years? Mark Rohr : Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And we're going to continue to be opportunistic with what's in front of us. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. All right. Thanks. Mark Rohr : Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Hi there. Two quick ones. On EM you'd normally don't discuss trends on a regional basis and so I'm just curious as you think about the way the project pipeline is evolving if the large customers start re-jiggering their global supply chains over the next two years, three years would you see any hiccup in the pattern or how would you flex to adjust for that? And secondly, Mark, your comment about productivity and taking advantage of more opportunities across the system, some companies characterize this in terms of spreads and some characterize it in terms of taking advantage of volatility, and a few years ago you used to talk about having a $100 million or so several chunks of headwinds that would happen under the surface and you would try and offset them is the issue sort of spreads or volatility, or is it just that there is fewer adverse areas of lumpiness that we've seen in the last few years? Mark Rohr : So, Scott, why don\u2019t you take the first one which has sounded sort of \u2013 Scott Richardson : Yeah. Mark Rohr : A view of changes in the world and the supply chains moving around and what impact that would have on the others. Scott Richardson : Yeah. Sure. I mean, Laurence, so in our EM business, I mean, we are growing in everyregion and yes, you see very short periods where it's slower in one than the other, but we are positioned globally to put out solutions that move our supply chain around as we need to. So we don't see any kind of rejiggering of customers supply chains and so forth impacting that business at all. Mark Rohr : Okay. So you asked a lot of questions Laurence on the last piece. So I\u2019ll try to start with productivity and carry that forward. So some folks on the call may not -- may not remember that the 2012, 2013, 2014 kind of timeframe there was tremendous headwinds that based our confident, orders of magnitude $500 million between methanol and the loss with southern contract. We had a huge step change almost overnight and FX it was really big impactful for us. We had gone out in a very blissful way and they claim to profitability from ethanol surely wasn't going to happen in there. Through that period we overcame those with a very strong productivity effort in moving our business models and had double digit earnings as well through that period. Since that time we have doubled the profitability of this company three years we have doubled the profitability of the company and we've done that in a real fundamental way employing these business models, directly to leverage our ability to manage complexity just out there unless complexity that can be to volatility, it can be from straightforward movements, it can be an EN business is related to the opportunities we bring these customers to create unique solutions and therefore differentiate themselves in the marketplace. Those models have been more and more refined we're going to another element of full refinement today based on a learning for the last 12 months, 18 months, and we think those models have yet to fully realize our potential. So we don't \u2013 we say right there that's utilized on a pure productivity through that period of time if you look at it over the last couple of years we've actually dropped our net productivity contributions. And that's not because there's not opportunities there, but we have really more to do I\u2019d say with the work on the model and that sort of thing. Now we're into a period where we can take a different look at productivity, which is to say we have volume growth opportunities out there, which give then confidence to look at embedded inefficiencies that exists in different regions of the world and different assets and take a position relative to that. So we think we have a new ground of productivity in front of us that will be a CapEx related productivity that can generate some very, very high returns. And I mentioned two of them that we've just talked about here over the last several days. So we think that, that we'll be able to move into that arena quite successfully and we see that it's enhancing the earnings capability for operation which gives us comfort this level we're at today in a broad sense is like what we said into a foundational level. I don\u2019t mean we're up every day and little bit more the next day but what it does mean we've got a different foundation base to work from. And we don't see any reason why that should really change dramatically. Yeah, trade flows move around, but they have to move around. Companies move around but that's going on. Trend is strong Trend is weak. That's all that stuff that\u2019s happened throughout that time period that we've been under the last several years and we've been able to manage to do that. So, we don't have too much anxiety about it. And to be honest we don't we don't tend to micromanage it terribly We don\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about it. We look at the big fundamentals. So you need to think of some and you know it\u2019s well as the company that has really good business models, generates a lot of profitability through thick and thin and have a lot cash through thick and thin, and most importantly we don't do stupid things. We manage that cash very well and we get it back to you as best as we can. Laurence Alexander : Yeah. Perfect. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. Good morning, fellows. Mark Rohr : Good morning, Duffy. Duffy Fischer : Quick question. A couple of years ago, your Singapore plant was fairly uncompetitive in a low oil environment, and then you had redone your carbon monoxide contract with Linde making it competitive. Do we need to worry with rising oil prices that that plant can become uncompetitive again? Mark Rohr : We are -- it\u2019s very dependent on oil and as it relates to the bunker fuel and as you know that's gone through its own set of volatilities around concerns or not concerns but uncertainty about how to manage the move to a low sulfur bunker. So, yeah, as that unit gets pressed, it's going to be a little bit less competitive. It's still a good unit for us in operation, one that you could enter a period if we get back above 100, but that unit is less competitive. Having said that, we have opportunities to do other things that can surface without. So we don't \u2013 we're not particularly worried about. Scott Richardson : Yeah, and we did do some things a few years ago as you alluded to, Duffy. That does give us a little bit more flexibility in the high oil environment. So we are exposed, but not as much as we were in the past. Mark Rohr : Okay. And then the announcement you made on Germany. Can we read into that \u2026 Scott Richardson : Duffy, you're breaking up a bit. Can you repeat that? Read into that -- Mark Rohr : Duffy, you're breaking up a bit, can you repeat that, the announcement with our -- Duffy Fischer : All right. I was just going to say with the announcement you made on Germany can we read into that? Did the Ibn Sina plant did is now on stream is filling out pretty nicely. And then if that's fair roughly how much has it been seen it contributing year-over-year because we're still annualizing I think to bump up in your ownership stake there? Scott Sutton : Yeah. Duffy, this is Scott Sutton. So I mean the announcement was made in Germany about expanding that plant right is strictly because you know we're in a real healthy business situation there you know demand supply tight and palm and it's time to add a little bit. And yes I think you can read into that that the Ibn Sina POM plant is running very satisfactory. We do see our equity earnings in that business up, almost all of that increase is due to better performance at Ibn Sina. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. Scott Sutton : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. If I read your prepared comments correctly I saw you called out 4% organic volume growth and in EM and in the sense to get back to 69% and then I guess that the 4% was maybe due to some of the pricing. I'm just curious are the customers buying less from you or are they buying more from others or so there's a push out of demand around pricing or did you actually see some share for the meantime? Mark Rohr : Yeah. Well really I mean the main driver of that and he can't look too much at quarter-to-quarter. But the main driver behind that was we have lifted price quite a bit to overcome the raw materials inflation so you know we ended up being successful at getting all that price and still growing volume as well. So I don't read any kind of fundamental shift in demand in that. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Just as a follow-up on the goal of the 5000 project wins, how would you characterize \u2013 do you have to have the intellectual capital needed to get to 5000 projects at a time and do you have the sort of physical R&D footprint necessary or would that be more investments in people and facilities necessary to scale up that way. Mark Rohr : Well, we I mean we continue to invest in people. We have a very good team growing each, each day in terms of capability. We continue to invest in R&D. A lot of it is incremental capability as we improve the model as well. Vincent Andrews : And then on the physical side of things anymore... Mark Rohr : Yeah, on the physical side of things I mean, you've seen us make quite a number of announcements. We are in the process of expanding compounding capability in at least four or five sites. We\u2019re expanding two of our polymers that we've made announcements on, as well both POM and our GUR ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. There'll be some more of those. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Understood. Thanks very much. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Shehan with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jim Shehan : Thanks. In the engineered materials or organic growth, you just spoke to the deceleration that occurred because of the higher pass-through of raw materials. It sounds like you did quite well in automotive. So which end market actually experienced that demand destruction, was it medical, was it industrial or something else. And what gives you the confidence in getting a reacceleration in that organic growth to the high single digits. Mark Rohr : Yeah sure. I\u2019ll start I mean, I\u2019ll let Scott to run you the details. I think I would, Jim, I would \u2013 I think it's best to look at this not as markets. We talked at our April session with you guys about the embedded growth process that we deal with so we look beyond markets in those specific application so for us it's a very generic world out there, but generic being that everything we do is specific to some unique trait and the ability we can have and it's independent of the market. So we don't look at these light markets and we don't \u2013 and we don't analyze our movements nor we put our teams in place, we don't do anything relative to markets, we really work at it as applications, differentiation and we do anything we lump together simple application to create programs that go into certain arenas. So it's \u2013 I like to answer your question but we really don't look at it even that way. Jim Shehan : Thank you. Mark Rohr : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from our Alex Yefremov with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Alex Yefremov : Good morning. Thank you. Understanding that your POM portfolio is mostly differentiated if you look at the industry as a whole is POM operating at a high rate at this point? Mark Rohr : Yeah. I mean the answer is yes, and we have a lot of differentiated products, we also have some more standard products as well but the whole industry is operating at a pretty high rate. Alex Yefremov : Understood. Thank you. On your guidance for 2019 is there any buyback or M&A assumption within that? Mark Rohr : Yeah. What \u2013 Yeah, not really. If you look at where we are from the earnings point of view the buyback we're talking about is a pretty de minimis effect and so to imply that we have the ability to forecast things in the 10%, 20% kind of range and we don\u2019t have that ability. So, no, not in there. Alex Yefremov : I understood that. Thank you. Surabhi Varshney : Anita, let\u2019s take one more question and it will be the last for the call. Operator : The last question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The release mentioned that project wins and EM were up 58% year-over-year. Could you provide a breakout or maybe any sort of general commentary on how much of this growth is coming from existing customers and how much is coming from new customers and where do you see the most opportunity going forward? Mark Rohr : Yeah that's right. I mean Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year it is up those kind of percentages we did close 925 projects and that comes from a real mix. I'm not going to give you the exact numbers, but I think it's safe to say that both existing customers are comprehensive solutions portfolio is being applied to a bigger set of their needs and at the same time, we're also out there trying to translate those wins or those technologies to a new set of customers what really is both. Matthew Blair : Great. And then in the retail chain we saw reports of a fair amount of planned and unplanned maintenance in Singapore and then geeing in Q3, but then obviously the results were really strong. So it\u2019s curious if you felt like you left any opportunity on the table in Q3 and if so how much? Mark Rohr : No, no we didn't. We really don't believe what up to any other type of boss. I mean we're back in every corner of the world to do what we can to make money. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. Thanks. Mark Rohr : Sure. Surabhi Varshney : We will now conclude the call. Thank you for your questions and for listening in this morning. We are available after the call to address any further questions you may have. Anita, please close the call. Operator : This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Jerry. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This is Chuck Kyrish. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliot, Senior Vice President, Acetyl Chain. Today\u2019s presentation includes forward-looking statements about expectations for the future results. Actual results might differ materially from these statements. Please see our SEC reports for risk factors relating any forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. You can find information related to these non-GAAP measures and reconciliation to their comparable GAAP measures on our website in the Investor Relations section. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials are available on the SEC\u2019s EDGAR system. Celanese Corporation distributed its fourth quarter 2018 earnings release via Business Wire and posted slides and prepared remarks about the quarter in the Investor Relations section of our website yesterday after market close. Since we published our comments yesterday, we\u2019ll go directly to your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Wondering if you could help us with the Acetyl Chain and just obviously a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter after a phenomenal year. What would you think the range of outcomes is this year in 2019? And what are the dynamics that would bookend that? There was a lot of conversation in your prepared remarks about sort of the interplay of methanol and oil and ethylene. But maybe you could just unpack that for all of us and help us with a framework for modeling purposes. Mark Rohr : Right. Well, let me \u2013 that\u2019s a huge question. So this is Mark and I\u2019ll kick that off, ask Todd to make some comments here. Let me start kind of from the beginning. I think a lot of this conundrum the world finds itself in today regarding sort of the economic environment really relates to the collapse in oil prices that occurred really last year. And that collapse in oil prices kind of rippled through so many raw materials, petrochemical industry in a broad sense. And of course, that had huge impacts and ripple effects back on ethylene in China, the MTO in China and ultimately methanol. So you had all these dynamics that kind of rolled into that. So we saw weakness and we saw slowdown really as we ended the fourth quarter. The back couple of months of the fourth quarter in the chain business, we saw some settling with that. And in that process of settling, we think that, that\u2019s, I wouldn\u2019t say run its course, but it seems to be kind of normalizing now at the level. And we think we\u2019re going to see that start to recover as we get into the end of this quarter and start the next quarter going forward. The broad dynamics are of that is it was \u2013 and Todd, again I\u2019ll ask you to give some more color on this in a second. But really is around China and the impact in China that we saw, the pricing we saw in China. And in many ways, it was a little bit contained in that region of the world. So we see and we feel that we have \u2013 and I\u2019ll talk about this more when we talk about earnings, our earnings forecast. We think with this business is going to step down a little bit this year. But we feel very good about the fundamentals of this business and the ongoing earning power to this business in this range of around $1 billion. So Todd, do you want to provide more clarity perhaps on just what you saw throughout. Todd Elliot : Well, just on the note about global capacity utilization, so the macro fundamentals, we believe, are still in play. That is that when you look at the diversity of end uses across that, acetyl is growing around 3% per year. Stack that up with the capacity picture, we still see those macro utilization rates in about the net 80% range across the whole system. So what Mark was describing is this end of the year, instantaneous utilization rate change mainly on slower demand, particularly in China. So as that sorts itself through as we get into first part of 2019, you kind of march through the quarter, particularly after Chinese New Year, we think that will bump up those instantaneous utilization rates into \u2013 back up into the 80% range. And that will allow some price recovery over the course of the year. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow-up, the decision to take the capacity out of Asia as you ramp up new capacity in the U.S., is the math effectively that the savings you\u2019re going to get from doing that and the optimization more than offsets whatever sort of the EBITDA opportunity was there? And then obviously, you also get to take some capacity out of the market, which might help the earnings power of all your other assets. Is that the right way to think about it? Mark Rohr : Yes. I think what we\u2019re trying to convey here in a big sense \u2013 and it\u2019s part of sort of the ongoing debate about whether people are giving value back to our shareholders for this business. But we can \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 to be honest, we\u2019re the only company in the world that can take and make these investments at very modest level, get this kind of high return on productivity only. So you don\u2019t have to have a view that the market\u2019s going to grow or the demand is needed for us to add yet another $100 million to our foundation. So what we think that foundation are based on in the business is plus $100 million for that through these kinds of moves. And be it that or be it the VAM investments, that\u2019s what you see. So this is a way for us to, we think, keep balance within the \u2013 what we feel will be the demand picture as we have at that period of time with plenty of upside capacity to tackle that in a more EBITDA and return return-friendly fashion. Todd Elliot : Yes, absolutely. It\u2019s about always looking for another series of value creation steps that adds to the foundational level of earnings in acetyl. So this is the next wave that we\u2019re embarking on, so bring significant production. Ultimately, to Clear Lake, we have advantaged integration backwards to methanol, soon to be in carbon monoxide when that acquisition clears. Also we have other sources of CO there. First, we have the VAM downstream usage there on Clear Lake, just expanded that unit by 150,000 tons. So think very good integration benefit, a huge range of operating rate flexibility more so than we have today particularly in the Asian side. So that helps us. And to Mark\u2019s point, it\u2019s largely a productivity measure when we look out on this. So it\u2019s a nice combination of value addition steps. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. And welcome back to Chuck. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Mark, just on Engineered Materials, can you provide a little more color on the 2% operating profit growth in the quarter? Why was it so light? And looking forward to 2019, maybe expectations for that business in 2019. Mark Rohr : Yes, I\u2019ll start with the last one. We expect that business to grow \u2013 kind of as it has grown 10% kind of earnings contribution year-over-year. So you plug that into your model. If you look at the fourth quarter, we did see slowdown in this business as well. We were out there pushing pricing a lot to tee up what we felt was a better return for many of our polymers as we entered 2019. And we\u2019re doing that in the face of the destocking that was naturally occurring for the reasons that I listed for that. So the world \u2013 what we really saw here for the quarter is we saw good uptick in both volume and pricing to be offset a lot by extraordinary costs that rolled through our system. From inventory costs that we had as we worked down some of our inventory, extraordinary cost with logistics and things like that really impacted it in a negative way. So it\u2019s really a more cost-driven reduction versus any kind of falloff in the base business. David Begleiter : Got it. And just on \u2013 sorry. Scott Richardson : No, sorry, David. This is Scott Richardson. I just want to add there. I think it\u2019s important also to remember the project wins that we had in the year were right on track with what we\u2019ve said. So we finished north of 3,200 projects during the year. So the business continues to be on track for those controllable factors that we stated. And we\u2019re very clear about the importance of driving price as raws moved up during 2018 and we\u2019re very successful in doing that. And that should yield benefits from a margin perspective moving in to 2019, which can lead to the growth that Mark talked about, around 10%. David Begleiter : Very good. And Mark, just now you reaffirmed the 2020 target, $12 a share, which now implies about 14% EPS growth in 2020 versus 2019. Can you probably provide a bridge, given that\u2019s a little bit of a robust target, given a pretty lackluster macro backdrop? Mark Rohr : Yes. Let me just \u2013 there\u2019s \u2013 in the fundamental sense, if I look at it versus where we think we\u2019ll end this year, that\u2019s probably another $300 million or so of upside. In a real simple sense, we expect as we\u2019re ending this year and starting next to be moving back into plus $100 million kind of range for the AC business. We think that $1 billion, $950 million to $1 billion, is pretty much what is in the cards for us there. We expect we\u2019re going to add another $100 million incrementally in EM as we go \u2013 as we move into \u2013 from 2019 to 2020. In that process, we\u2019ll have, of course, in AC, which is essentially to establish our basic strategy \u2013 I mean, in acetate tow, our basic strategy. That leaves a balance of the last time we were leasing $50 million that\u2019s from M&A that we\u2019ve got our eyes set on. And the other $50 million is productivity. David Begleiter : Great. Thank you very much, Mark and Scott. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Mike Sison : Hey guys. Mark, when you think about the Acetyl Chain near term, I just want to make sure I understand. Can you maybe walk us through how those utilization rates went through the fourth quarter? And then I think I got the feel that it\u2019s under 80% now. And what could get that above 80% as we head into the second half of the year? Just want to make sure it\u2019s more demand-related than supply-related. Mark Rohr : Well, I\u2019ll ask Todd to give specific numbers here. But in a broad sense, it\u2019s not supply-related at all. The slowdown in China was just a slowdown. And so we saw industry utilization rates across the board in China well beyond AC drop. End result, actually we saw less activity in terms of Clean Sky initiatives and stuff because actually there wasn\u2019t nearly as much industrial production going on as you would normally have. So that in the fundamental sense is what happened. And I think we dropped into the very low 80s. Now whether it was \u2013 whether we touched the 70% or not, we don\u2019t know, but certainly stayed on 3 to 4 turns, I think, on capacity utilization on a short-term basis. We also believe that, that\u2019s largely run its course. The business seems to have settled in. And this has happened in a very short period of time. That seems to have settled in. And we have a fair degree of confidence that as Chinese New Year ends and some of these other problems get cleared up, we\u2019re going to see it march right back up. But Todd, do you want to maybe give some specific numbers. Todd Elliot : I think if you see the capacity at 15 million tons of global demand, 18 million tons of capacity. And that\u2019s about 83%. And these are numbers that we talked about before. VAM is 6 million tons of demand, 7 million tons of supply, that\u2019s about 85% utilization. We think those big macro numbers are still in play. There have been little to no additions to that supply base. So this is really, as Mark described, an end of the year, first part of 2019 demand slowdown for various reasons, oil prices falling, ethanol prices falling, sentiment, trade, fill in the blank. Now that can quickly reverse itself when customers start buying again. And this is particularly acute in China. It\u2019s really what we\u2019re describing here. If we look at our order books elsewhere in the world, in Europe, in Americas and then also when we extend beyond just the acetic acid discussion into vinyl acetate or emulsion, order books are actually pretty good at the start of the year. So this is really a short China out in the near term. And that really speaks to that instantaneous dip under the mid-80% range, pick a number, probably high 70s or something for a few weeks here at the end of the year, start of the year. But that, again once inventories dry out, once demand kicks back in, that can quickly start to come back into balance, which we expect it will. Mike Sison : Great. And then shifting gears to EM, the new projects continue to roll. And what type of organic growth do you think EM could generate this year? And then is the pipeline for acquisition still pretty robust to build on that as you go forward? Scott Richardson : Yes. Mike, we expect to get back up into the mid to high single-digit type volume growth as we work our way into 2019. Now Q1, we think, will be a little bit softer on that. But we do expect to be able to grow. So we may be in the low single-digit year-over-year growth level in Q1. But as we work our way into the balance of the year, as we see this destocking work itself out, we think that will recover. We continue to be very \u2013 we see the pipeline being very favorable for us. And we saw that play out even towards the end of the year as our growth that, for example, in automotive was around 3%, whereas the industry declined. And so the controllable projects and the things we continue to work with our customers are there. And that\u2019s going to get us back into what we think is going to be really good, positive volume growth numbers in 2019. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, can you talk about how much capital you had to spend or you did to spend on the syngas plant in Clear Lake? Is that a future strategy to get back with integrated? I guess, I don\u2019t see the merits of that. But if you have better uses of your capital, I just want to\u2026 Mark Rohr : The answer to your question, I\u2019m not going to give you an exact number. But it will be public before too long. But that\u2019s a legacy asset that actually Celanese owned years ago. It\u2019s kind of embedded in our asset. And of course, we had the opportunity to acquire that. When you look at in terms of reference to a new unit, it\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s a fraction of the cost of a new unit. So it presents very favorable economics for us as we look at expanding acetic acid production there. So that\u2019s how it plugs into it. Robert Koort : So that unit wasn\u2019t supplying you currently? Mark Rohr : It was. But Air Products now \u2013 Linde is building a new unit. So old Linde had lost their \u2013 had lost that contract with us. Robert Koort : And you guys obviously got more aggressive in the market. You talked about being opportunistic, buying stock at about $100 in the fourth quarter. Should we presume, given your optimism into 2019, second half of 2020 that you should be buying quite a bit of stock here in the first part of the year as well? Mark Rohr : Yes. We have $700 million still available to us between what we\u2019ve promised you guys we\u2019d buy and what\u2019s authorized to buy. So we will continue to be opportunistic with that. Robert Koort : Got it. Thank you. Mark Rohr : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess, back to the $100 million sort of productivity boost as part of your acetic acid network adjustments, can you sort of break that out between production, savings and logistics? And is it just not as important going forward to be as diversified from a feedstock standpoint? Mark Rohr : Yes, we think it is very important to be diversified from a feedstock standpoint. The economics associated with the asset bases that we have in the U.S. and in this next incremental investment in there is stunningly good. And it\u2019s so good that it overcomes disadvantage you would normally see in logistics and things like that. So it\u2019s a unique opportunity for us to restructure, reconfigure, as Todd said, and drive just on constant volume and net lower cost base of approximately $100 million. And the important message for you in that is you can present value that back today if you like to do that because it is a set $100 million and it\u2019s not dependent on acetic acid pricing or those sorts of things to achieve. So that\u2019s the message, the thematic that we\u2019re trying to get across. If we can take steps to increase and lift that floor, that foundation, whatever you may happen to feel it is and still position ourselves in it as this business grows, this capacity utilization tightens up, which we fully expect to happen, to have yet again more capacity available to drive the market around the world. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just, Mark, in your prepared comments, you mentioned some of your U.S. customers seemed a bit more optimistic looking out to 2019. Can you sort of expand on that? And then maybe generally, can you touch on Europe as well? Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Yes. I think when you really \u2013 when you talk to, as we do \u2013 we\u2019re privileged to have a great customer base working with us, works all the time. I think they in many ways are shocked or surprised with sort of the global anxiety that exists as we are. I\u2019ll say our U.S. customers, where everybody\u2019s gone through a little bit of a stutter step here in the fourth quarter, on average are quite optimistic. They don\u2019t \u2013 they see the fundamentals as being very strong, see the consumers largely in areas where we are still in there. We\u2019ve lived through a rationalization and slowdown and all the capacity and things like that. But when you look forward, they\u2019re not expecting that to continue, expect those things to reverse a bit. So there\u2019s a good bit of enthusiasm there. And as Todd said, the order patterns seem to reaffirm that, what we\u2019re seeing right now. If you go to Asia, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the same thing. China went through this stutter step. A lot of it is tied to anxiety over trade that\u2019s there as well as normal seasonality, which has been missing there. So they\u2019re sitting there waiting for Chinese New Year to end and with an anticipation that somehow we\u2019ll find a way to moderate some of the anxiety to trade. So they\u2019re not overly pessimistic. And we look at fundamentals there, we think in the case of \u2013 if you would look it at although, which is probably the most public example, we\u2019re expecting that business to not slide further but to actually rebound a bit as we entered this year. So our Chinese customers are not overly anxious or overly frightful right now. I\u2019d roll that into \u2013 if I look at Europe, and so in Europe, we talk largely Germany, there\u2019s a fair amount of pessimism there. And it\u2019s the anxiety over the exit of \u2013 Brexit. Brexit is an anxiety point. I think political pressures in country are an anxiety point. And they also feel like they\u2019ve been impacted somewhat by Chinese trade. So in the Rhine River, we see all the things. And I think that we see more pessimism on average out of Europe. And that\u2019s very German-centric when I say that because most of our \u2013 or a lot of our big customers are in Germany. So I think what we see is we see Asia in some ways leading us out a bit, leading the world out of this kind of anxiety. We don\u2019t think the U.S. is going to be impacted very much. And we think as Asia starts to recover, you\u2019ll see Europe stabilize and start to recover as well. Ghansham Panjabi : Terrific. Thanks so much, Mark. Operator : The next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning, fellows. A question just around the strategy in acetic acid coming back to you. I think the permit you filed last month showed a $425 million capital tag. So one, is that a decent number? And two, how should we think about that impacting the overall capital spend to Celanese over the next three years? Mark Rohr : Yes. It\u2019s in the range of the right number. That\u2019s what I would say. And those are numbers we\u2019re required to put in preliminary kind of numbers when we present the sort of permit application. So yes, it\u2019s directionally correct. I\u2019m sorry, what was the second? Duffy Fischer : Just the capital. Mark Rohr : Yes. So $350 million to $400 million this coming year, I think, in CapEx, moving up as we get out into 2020 and 2021, where you\u2019ll see most of this being spent. So yes, we\u2019ll be moving above $400 million, I think, as we enter into the next several years beyond this year. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then in the U.S., you\u2019re still net short methanol even though you\u2019re getting some from your JV partner. As you bring on this acetic acid, does that drive you to want to own more methanol? What\u2019s the strategy integration there? And the syngas plant, will you be net short syngas in the U.S. even if you were short methanol? Mark Rohr : I\u2019ll start this. And Todd, you hop into this as well, please. We have a wonderful partnership with Mitsui with methanol. They\u2019re the world\u2019s most efficient methanol plant and highly regarded as such. I\u2019ll let Todd talk about the options there that the guys are looking at to expand and to grow. On syngas, it\u2019s a really good fit with the first phase of capacity we announced with this expansion of acetic acid. So Todd, do you want to\u2026 Todd Elliott : Yes, the run rate \u2013 operating rate out out of the methanol unit has exceeded original design capacity. So we\u2019re pleased with that progress. So that\u2019s contributing. We\u2019re still a buyer, a net buyer. So that remains unchanged. We are looking with our partner, looking at options in conjunction with the just announced reconfiguration and expansion in the U.S. for methanol options looking ahead. Nothing to say at this point. But that\u2019s just a part of our ongoing work together with our partner, Mitsui. So we will look at options there. And it could actually take the shape in two different phases. But more to come on that one. On your CO question, we were not integrated before. So we source CO from our partners there. Mark mentioned Linde, of course, as well as their product. The other new partner will be Praxair going forward, who\u2019s constructing a unit as we speak. So this is a step into integration through a very unique opportunity that presented itself as a part of the Linde-Praxair merger. It\u2019s a small step forward but also complementary as we think about the longer-term plan for the expanded acetic acid footprint in Clear Lake. So it fits to that integration. And methanol is good news so far and more to come on that as we investigate alternatives. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : The next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. With regard to the acetyl expansion and the economics on it, it looks like it\u2019s pretty compelling. At the same time, should we be reading anything into the need to necessarily close in the Asian capacity with regard to how you\u2019re thinking about the long-term growth in that region, et cetera, because it\u2019s certainly an area that you\u2019ve been growing out historically versus cutting out capacity? Mark Rohr : No, I think this is a reconfiguring. It doesn\u2019t forgo \u2013 it doesn\u2019t imply anything in terms of our beliefs around growth in Asia, if that makes sense. It\u2019s a way that from an aesthetic sense, you can reconfigure and give yourself more optionality. And yes, so we remain very bullish on Asia. And we remain bullish with our option needs with the assets we have there and other assets we\u2019re going to put there in the future. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t look at it that way at all, John. It\u2019s simply a step-change to up our base level of earnings in the company and give ourselves more optionality in the future. John McNulty : Got it. And then just a question on the longer-term outlook for \u2013 in China in particular around some of the environmental issues. I know that was \u2013 it\u2019s been a hot topic certainly last year. It seems to have cooled off a little bit. But are you starting to hear anything? Or are there any changes in terms of how to think about some of the potential capacity closures as we look to kind of 2019 and beyond? Todd Elliott : Yes, it\u2019s \u2013 and we keep track of this continuously. The earlier policy, I guess, reveals or updates that came out of Shandong and Yunnan provinces, we\u2019re studying those. We don\u2019t see a direct impact into the acetyl business so far in terms of specific units that would need to come out. There\u2019s actually one band unit on Linde province that we think that\u2019s got a circle around it that might be removed. That\u2019s about a 100,000 ton unit. We just saw some news come out from Hubei province. And this is in conjunction with the Yangtze River changes, so the proximity to the river. So Hubei province issued chemical plant relocation list, I think, on December 13. And there\u2019s like 480 plants that are mentioned there that are on the list for review. And so it continues. And it\u2019s a real, real subject. It continues to be drawn out. And information published from respective provinces, we look at those. And as we see direct line to specific operating units, we will update as we go. John McNulty : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning. Hey Mark, you go in detail to describe how MTO production, how it connects C1 and C2 chemistry and the impact in China. And you were able to increase your acetyl spreads over methanol. I\u2019m wondering, did you flex down your production in China or Singapore to do that? And if not, what exactly did you do to increase your margins? Mark Rohr : Well, I think really what it\u2019s just \u2013 and maybe I\u2019ve spent too much time on that in the written script. But I want people to understand how the economics work. But I also want to make a point that as you \u2013 from a legacy point of view, there certainly was a strong tie between methanol price in China and acetic acid price in China. As you go up in capacity utilization, that starts to diminish. And you start to see it break away. And then as you look at the global optionality that we have and the way that Todd Elliott and company have run this business globally, we\u2019re able to find ways to further disconnect those two things. So a lot of independent actions rather than disconnect, including buying and reselling, including how we operate our units around the world. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything special in that. I look at what exactly we did for that. We did the same thing we always do, which is drive optionality to create the most value for our shareholders. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then secondly, Mark, you guide that Celanese has really good read into China with your business intelligence there. And you say that weakness was due to geopolitical issues and not fundamental. So in your mind, at what point do the geopolitical issues become fundamental issues? Do you care to comment on that? Mark Rohr : Well, I don\u2019t know how to quite answer that question. I guess, when you go through a period of growth like the world has gone through the last several years, and certainly Celanese has gone through the last years, you develop a behavior mechanism. And so that behavior is that you covet inventory. You do things like that because the world is kind of on fire. And if somebody says to the crowd, to the masses, say, not so fast, pump the breaks, the brakes get pumped. And when that happens, you have a ripple effect that rolls through. And that ripple effect has a lasting feeling to it, a lasting feeling being three, four or five months. But it\u2019s kind of the stack-up of inventories, the production planning process, delivery cycle all gets interrupted. And that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re in today. So I think when I say when you pump the brakes, what does it mean? It means a couple of quarters of this stuff is kind of what it means. Just because of the \u2013 again, the lag time of cycles that you get into. So I think the geopolitical pressure has happened several of those cycles but really just set into some \u2013 like a large order or something like that. It takes a lot more than that really to drive our country and our economy into negative growth levels. So our view is that this has been just a pump the brakes brought on by different levels of anxiety. People in China are quite concerned about the \u2013 they\u2019re quite concerned about the relationship with the U.S. They\u2019re not so concerned about trade. They think that\u2019s just an indication of our relationship. So our relationship with China needs to get better. And I see a lot of signs that, that\u2019s starting to happen in spite of some of the political and legal actions that are underway today. I mean, I think fundamentally, it\u2019s a little bit better. And hopefully, the trade this week will add to that. In the case of Europe, I think it\u2019s a little bit more \u2013 it\u2019s more of a question of what\u2019s going on with \u2013 in trade relative to the EU and Britain. Because we just don\u2019t know the uncertainty level to that ripple effect of that and whether it\u2019s going to have a bigger play throughout Europe. So my belief is we pump the brakes for a couple of months. I don\u2019t think which is how long economy oil price to drop. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see ourselves sort of come out of that. There\u2019s no reason fundamentally for it to change. In our way, it stays likely as if the political situation gets worse versus getting better. I think it\u2019s going to get better. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you for the detail. Operator : The next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. In cig tow, you continue to take kind of tactical actions to improve the business, like the shutdown in Mexico. Are there any strategic actions still on the table that you\u2019re thinking about in cig tow over time? Mark Rohr : There are. And we\u2019re having trouble making those happen just yet. But we\u2019re working \u2013 we continue to work those. And I think it\u2019s only, John, a matter of time before something surfaces there because it\u2019s such an obvious need on the part of not only the producers but also the customers out there that still want very reliable supply and expect it to. No one\u2019s asked a question on tow relative to the quarter. And we talked a little bit in the quarter, which really was related to fixed costs rolling through that were very unusual for us. And we should have done a very good job of anticipating to communicate to The Street, which we did not. And we also missed several orders, we just logistically couldn\u2019t get them out. Those things \u2013 certainly, if the orders reverse themselves, we would expect feedback in the mid-60s as we get into the first quarter. John Roberts : And then on the supply chain correction in the Engineered Materials segment, do you have any primary data on where your customers\u2019 inventories are or how much contained plastics are down the supply chain? Or are you just basically triangulating between what you\u2019re seeing in market data about end market growth versus what you\u2019re selling into the channel? Mark Rohr : We did a bit more triangulating today. I think my comments on this year\u2019s earnings really relate to kind of a view that we have a very high level of what\u2019s going to happen. And we\u2019ll be able to update that more in April. Chuck Kyrish : Hey, Jerry. We will make the next question be the final question. Operator : And that question will be from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. With regard to your acetyl rationalization plans in Asia, Mark, could you comment as to whether you\u2019re dismantling capacity in either China or Singapore? I\u2019m trying to get a feel for whether you\u2019re rationalizing capacity or production plans or both? Mark Rohr : Well, the way we\u2019ve \u2013 to answer your question, we\u2019re not fully committed to any one site to make that happen just yet. There\u2019s options in value, different values slightly, depending on which way we go with that. Our intention is if we rationalize capacity, it\u2019s rationalized. So that means it\u2019s not available. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then with regard to the syngas plant acquisition, what impact would you expect that to have on your acetic acid margins or your segment margins? And could you comment on what happens with the hydrogen coming out of that unit, whether or not you need any internally or wheel it back to a gas supplier? Mark Rohr : Yes, I think the marginal impact is \u2013 it\u2019s actually a return on capital impact is where you get it because you\u2019re avoiding a capital investment. And then on a variable cost basis, it\u2019s the same going in there. And I haven\u2019t really sat down and worked through the actual return you get. But you see it in lower levels of invested capital on return on that capital to produce the acetic acid. That\u2019s how you\u2019re going to see it. I don\u2019t know if you want to take\u2026 Todd Elliott : It fits, Kevin, with the expanded footprint, right? When we think of the three sources that we\u2019ll have, it fits there and creates a wide range of operating rate flexibility, much more than we have today when you think about our Asian footprint. So it fits with integration, it fits with future times and therefore requirement for CO and then operating rate flexibility, which we like as a part of our network process as we consider different decisions. And then the hydrogen reference, we do not have the need for it internally. That would be packaged up in an arrangement with an industrial gas supplier or partner. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. Chuck Kyrish : Okay, great. Thanks, everyone, for the questions today and for listening in. We\u2019re available today after the call for any further concerns or questions you have. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host Chuck Kyrish. Thank you. You may begin. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks Rob. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. With me today are Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliott, Senior Vice President, Acetyl Chain. Celanese Corporation distributed its first quarter 2019 earnings release via Business Wire and posted a slide presentation and prepared remarks about the quarter in the Investor Relations section of our website, yesterday, after market closed. Today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found on Slide 2 of the slide presentation and an important information. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions and other important information and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website in the Investor Relations section. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials are also available on the SEC's EDGAR system and our website. Because we published our prepared comments yesterday, we will now open the line directly for your questions. Q - John Roberts : Thank you. In Engineered Materials the affiliates underperformed the wholly owned operations. There's obviously some big regional differences between wholly owned and affiliates. But could you remind us with some of the application in plastic mix differences between the two? Mark Rohr : Yes, John. This is Mark. I'll start that maybe - maybe I'll start, Richardson could add some comments. But we did see our affiliates struggle a bit in the quarter. I think, the real issue there is that - trying to say product we're at are the global reach that we do primarily in the China and some limited application. So we continue to work with them to - to see if we can help them improve that performance. Scott Richardson : Yes, John, just to add a little bit more color. If we look that on year-over-year basis, obviously the entire decline in the equity earnings in terms due to probably plastics affiliates and really is - as Mark said largely related to the demand in China. John Roberts : And then, can you remind us how much you paid for the Linde syngas unit or is that going to be in the cash flow statement when the queue comes out? Mark Rohr : Yes, it is. It's lumped together there, John. We haven't said exactly what that amount was. It will be in the cash flow statement with our Next Polymers acquisition as well, is a very low capital, kind of optionality type investment that we made, which we commented on last quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Nice start to the year. And Mark congrats, and hope you have a lot of fun things lined up going forward. But I guess, I wanted to ask how Laurie's role will differ from yours, if any, and in terms of focusing on extracting value for the company and given your portfolio businesses? Mark Rohr : Sure, Mike. You know, this is pretty well, and the thing about Celanese is that we have a great, great business machine out there that brings a number of opportunities to us and the ability that machine to bring opportunities actually has the capability to overwhelm our internal mechanisms, being the unit operations, being the logistic systems and processes, ability to innovate as fast as we need to. And I spend a lot of my time on that and I'm sure that Laurie's going to spend a lot of her time working in those areas. We think in many ways it's the next frontier for Celanese to learn how to go from 20,000 FTEs to 30,000 manage that better than we do 20, is going to be a big part of us continuing to drive - drive value going forward. So, I think that's a major area of focus for us. The second one I would say is that when you look at the opportunities before, as you know, deploying cash continues to be the main focus of - my main focus and will be hers as well, and we have more and more opportunities surfacing and be a reality for Celanese, which would be a big part of unlocking shareholder value. So, I'd say those two things are top of mind, but you'll get a chance to meet her soon and ask the same questions. Mike Sison : And in terms of your outlook for 2Q, you noted that it should look similar to 1Q. But it does sound like the Acetyl Chain industry happening rates could improve. Now given out as you noted in your prepared remarks and then, and I guess thoughts on energy materials, your outlook still looks for good organic volume growth given project wins and just wondering what maybe headwinds that you see in 2Q that you wouldn't see a normal, say, improvement sequentially? Mark Rohr : Yes. Well, good, I'll start that, and I'm sure that Todd and Scott will add some comments here. But let me - one of things that's not readily apparent is internally the things that we deal with. So in Q2, we have a number of turnarounds in front of us. Those turnarounds will cost us $25 million, or $30 million, they call it $0.15 to $0.20 of headwinds baked in there. We're expecting raw materials - probably seeing raw materials in methanol to go up. Those kind of things that net, net record for another $10 million. And John asked a great question on affiliates and we see that affiliate number sliding a bit further. So before we even started this quarter, we've got at least $0.25 of unusual headwinds that we didn't have the first quarter of the year are quite strong in the first quarter of the year. So, I think on one hand, it's easy to say, well, life will be good you built in this point. I think the first half of this year is going to be a struggle. And I think maintaining numbers in the flat is a push for us. So I'd certainly wouldn't recommend anyone go higher than that number for the quarter. I just don't see that right now materializing. If I take a stab at EM, quickly, yes, we're pushing price really hard and we're pushing our mix really hard and the repercussions of that will not be that great as long as business starts to recover. We don't expect a full recovery in EM to start until more than second half of the year as well. You look at that in auto bill projections those things we're still down the second quarter. We should start some rebound going in the third quarter. So our fundamental belief as Mike is that we've got a bit more grant here before we get into the back half of the year where things should be starting to improve, but Todd you'll make some comments on AC this quarter. Todd Elliot : Yes. It's not only regarding acetyl, and we actually had a pretty good March, as we wrapped up Q1. Most of our - almost 40% of our business occurred in March, as we look at that profile. So we ended on a pretty good note as we wrapped up Q1. As we get into second quarter, Mark mentioned that Celanese has turnarounds, but it's pretty typical for the industry to have turnarounds during the second quarter. We've got turnaround in Bay City, Texas headwind and we've got to navigate around. We've got a fantastic network to do that with. I think a bigger issue right now is series of safety checks and audits following its provision in Yancheng and Jiangsu province at the end of March, that's put - properly a damper on operations throughout the province. So that's affected some of the downstream demand to start the quarter. So we got to see how that unfolds, but we'll certainly activate our network around these things and try to deliver the quarter kind of in line with Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Mark and Todd, you guys have talked in the past about maybe some of your competitive - competitors in China being subject to maybe a little bit more discipline and enforcement does this pace in your expectation of seeing some capacity out in China and maybe tightening operating rates even sooner and for longer? Mark Rohr : And again, I'll start with some Tom about specific color on some of the closures and stuff that comes from industrial parks. Bob the movement in China is fundamentally one in my personal view is of driving inflation. And if you think about that, the economy needs higher pricing to get a decent return on the over investments they've made for a long period of time. So when I kind of worked through that, myself what I see them doing is putting pressure on the 150,000 or so state run enterprises they are continuing to lift those earnings there. So that means environmental restrictions are going in, that means safety restrictions, and you've seen those sort of occur episodically. So we've gone through a period of safety events it seems like every six months and nine months and they continue to ratchet the impact of that and they're directing now. We are very public about the number of closures of chemical parks that are going to occur directly with that they will impact some of our competitors we think. But Todd do you want to carry on with that. Todd Elliot : Yes, I mean, just a specific follow up on this, the situation in Jiangsu. So remember before we talked about other provinces going through steps to examine environmental policy that continues, but in Jiangsu, we had not yet seen anything specifically around park policy. So what we're hearing have not see anything published yet, but we're hearing that Jiangsu will reduce the number of chemical parks from 49 down to 20, starting sometime in 2020 forward. How that ultimately is laid out and executed and started it remains to be same and the specifics remain to be same. But that's a significant development, a key set of step following this tragedy in Jiangsu. So that's probably the most impactful in our space. We've got to watch that. So think about where parks are near the Yangtze River or close to population centers and that gets more specific in terms of details we'll share that. Scott Richardson : Yes. And the only thing, I'd add to that Bob is, yes, it impacts our competitors, but it also can impact our customers too. And so there is kind of I would say a near-term demand impact of - on our customers as well as we see these audits and scrutiny continuing to ramp up. Mark Rohr : Yes. Just to follow that. So the specific kind of watch out downstream in CAA acetic acid, acetate esters, pharmaceutical intermediates kind of whole host of downstream applications are slow as these safety checks unfold and inventory levels are brought down probably the one bright spot would be terephthalic acid over the PET, that's held up pretty stronger in this period. But to Scott's point that, that's put a damper on April, but we'll see how that unfolds here as we get them. Robert Koort : Can I ask an EM question, Mark it seemed like maybe over the last few quarters you guys have been working hard on getting your price to offset raw materials. And I suspect towards the end of last year, when oil went down maybe some of your customers not only were destocking from macro fears and trying to tighten up their inventories, but also maybe hoping they'd see some relief on price oil. We've had oil rally now. I wonder if you give us a sense of where you see customer inventories destocking, restocking or ability to defer purchases in light of volatility in pricing? Mark Rohr : Well, there was - you call that right, Bob. There was definitely destocking going on as people wanted to had a view generally that prices will not come down and of course we rallied in the right kind of way to continue to drop higher prices through that period of time. So we're now in that kind of aftermath of that and waiting for a fundamental demand to pick up, which it seems to be in some areas, but again it's a bit too early to tell with that. As it relates to pricing Bob, what we've really done is, yeah, generally you've always make sure you look done as we went out and starting last year did just had a really hard look at where we were adding the most value and where we felt we were impacting customers in the most important way. We want to make sure that we're getting - our shareholders getting the right compensation for that. So we were very directly with pricing into those areas where we felt that the value was really being brought by selling these and applications and the molecules we had. So that approach is still ongoing and we don't intend to move away from that. You've asked me in the past, do we lose volume we do that? The answer is, sure, but we're really looking at a way to drop money. So everything that we do relative to pricing and if we elect not to participate on volume is a thoughtful process we go through to try to maximize the value back to our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Mark, would you expect EM volumes to be up year-over-year in Q2? Mark Rohr : I don't know. Scott, you have a view on that? Scott Richardson : Yes, I think we're going to be flattish, David, right now. I mean, we're still working as Mark just talked about. We're still working the price equation very hard. The one thing that is going to change probably slightly from Q1 and Q2 is, we'll quite have a little less destocking that occurs. I mean, it takes a good six months or so. When oil fell as hard as it did for that to kind of work its way through the value chain. And while our volumes were down year-over-year, and in the 3% range, a lot of our customers that we've talked to were kind down more in terms of 10% to 15% rage. And we were able to offset that largely through the new project winds that we had and started to flow through in the quarter. So, I would say at this point we're kind of looking at flattish. David Begleiter : Okay. Mark Rohr : Yes, at least from the discussions I'm involved in daily on this, really is China. China, if you look at projections in China, there was the view that in this quarter they'll start digging out of the hole that all those in China. And start that recovery down mid teens, sort of number in the first quarter, down less the second quarter and then actually be positive the back half of the year end up down 3% or 4%. So that has got to starts happening. If that starts happening we're in good shape. Let's say, it doesn't happen then you may see a little volume weakness as we go through this quarter. David Begleiter : And Mark in yours and Scott's comments, you mention actively considering strategic transformational options for your businesses. Has anything changed of late or have discussions picked up recently to drive these comments? Mark Rohr : Well, I think we have, when I look at the bolt on this except that for a minute we're seeing the size of bolt-ons increase and those are opportunities, does that make sense. So we're working a few now that would be in that $30 million to $70 million of EBITDA kind of range to $100 million where we've been doing that deals that have been sub-30 in EBITDA. So that's encouraging for us. We continue to work hard to position Celanese to be able to take advantage of transformational opportunities and that's a big personal thrust of mine. So as Lori comes in and takes over the CEO, I'm going to be devoting myself to that along with Lynne Puckett under General Counsel. So we'll be working as hard and we're optimistic that this deal - this year unfolds more opportunities come available and we'll work hard to see if we can capture one of those elements. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Angel Castillo : This is Angel Castillo on for Vincent. Just a quick question for me on - your comments on VAM, in terms of focusing on one VAM with also the Western Hemisphere and your ability to someone in this area. I was just curious because my understanding was that at least on the U.S. incremental down would likely be exported. So just in light of your expansion and again the comments on the Western Hemisphere, I was wondering, if you're able to sell your capacity in the U.S., or the particular factors that facilitated for you to be able to sell in the region? Scott Richardson : Yes, let me start that Mark. Yes, the expansion in Clear Lake, which we brought online in December of last year. So we added 150,000 tons of capacity, that's a key value step amongst several that were underway with an asset yield. And so the work around that started way before the plant ultimately was commissioned and that was to position our business in the most sort of attractive way as we think about contract mix around the world, good customer growth and mix around the world. So, yes, we did shift some of our profile a little more to the Western Hemisphere following that startup. So again intentional stuff keep of our value enhancement efforts and that continue into 2019 and beyond. Angel Castillo : And then in terms of your comments on China, you mentioned the high inventory obviously continue to work on the acetic side. Just curious - your thoughts take for the industry to work out of that inventory. And then also just in regards to your comment about slow start to April, I know, if you can give us more color or that just entirely related to the plant explosion or where there other things that you're seeing and that is perhaps causing more of a slow start? Mark Rohr : Yes, I mean, there's lots of trade question mark those process. But I think the main event follow the explosion in the subsequent audit and focus on inventory control throughout the country that are really just more specifically in the province of Jiangsu. So that's what we're watching and like I said before we had 40% of our business in Q1 happened in March, we thought we were starting to dig out of the softness at the start of the quarter. So I would point to that, point the derivatives acetic acid. I mentioned three before those are probably the ones to watch and that linked to the inventory bill that we saw in the quarter. Scott Richardson : Yes, so there's still adequate inventory. We think it's working its way down, but it's not down yet, if that was an attribute question. So there's still plenty of - there still excess material out there. And I think that needs to be resolved the way it will be resolved the China's economy needs to pick up a bit. It will pick up whenever there's a trade agreement in my opinion. So I think, we saw that trade discussion going on March, we saw business pick up the China's result of that, explosion and it slows back down again. I think there's still this waiting aspect going on personally going on in China. So hopefully wouldn't get that resolved in the next month or two. I think that would be good as we enter the second half of the year. Mark Rohr : Yes, and the other piece is the turnaround that I mentioned before. So in addition to ours there are multiple industry turnarounds in Q2, so that will play a role in the inventory dynamics as well. We count something like 17 of the 36 acid plants will be in turnaround in Q2. So many of those are in China, but that'll have a - play a role in the inventory dynamics. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: So question on - my question on acetyls, last quarter you announced rationalization of acidic capacity in Asia. And then you announced expansions in the US of VAM, acid and now methanol. So it seems like you're moving production back to the US, presumably because of the energy advantage here. So is that true and will you be exporting some of that material back to Asia? Mark Rohr : Yes, we know that, that's definitely, yeah, that's exactly what we're doing. When you look at the economics of that is pretty profound for us. The assets we have in China, or in Singapore, higher costs than the asset base we have in Europe and not only is that higher costs, if you look at, it's just the strip today for nat gas of five years or six years. We just roll that out. You can see that variability lasting for a very, very long period of time. I just meant economics of the day that this shows how solar power is actually offsetting the incremental gas being consumed for utilities in the state of Texas. I mean, so we have this low cost energy base here on the U.S. Gulf Coast is pretty phenomenal. And that the moves we're making really are moves to as tight as says it much better than I can, a step result from that base of let's say $800 million is going to trough earnings level for this business back up above $1 billion, about $100 million over that locked up in the acetic acid front primarily productivity just associated with that switch from Asia to the U.S. And then you add on top of that incremental methanol incremental VAM those kind of things. All those contribute towards again without any change in the basic business closing that gap gets you back to $1 billion and of course $1 billion beyond goes from that. So, yeah, that's what we're doing. So most of that material will end up offshore. The demand in U.S. is not really increasing. P.J. Juvekar: And then post all these expansions in the US, how integrated would acetyls be with your EM business. And how quickly can Scott separate these two businesses, if you decide to take any strategic action on any of the pieces? Thank you. Mark Rohr : Yes, the business are not - there's organizational integration that has to be separated and there's efficiencies associated with a single instance of SAP and those kind of things that you have to work through with some tax - things you have to work through. I think once before we talked about the penalty associated with that of being well north of $100 million per year so-called $1 billion of negative net present value. There's been a lot of work that Mr. Richardson has led over the years and we really dramatically dropped that down. Maybe it's $50 million for that. And we'll continue to work that down. But I think we'll get it to a point where should an opportunity arise that would facilitate a value creation step that way, it would be certainly possible without that kind of huge negative consequences that corporations often see when that happens. At the same time, we're seeing investment opportunities and they see we're being very thoughtful with those, every one we're doing is incremental at very, very low cost. But certainly it's getting to that point where it could do something else, we could do something else where that could make sense for that organization and for our shareholders. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Scott Richardson : Yes. And I mean depending on the deal, P.J., that we do if we got to that point, it's probably kind of a 6-ish month process for us to get something pulled off. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Leithead : It's Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning. On asset yields, first, I was hoping maybe you could remind us what your backwards integration into methanol would be after the recently announced methanol anesthetic acid expansion? And, second, is it fair to assume with your methanol expansion announced that a potential investment in second methanol unit is off the table right now? Todd Elliot : Yes, I'll do one. I'll start and you can add to that. We've talked about roughly a 50 :50 balance make/buy, and that includes as well our affiliate investment in Saudi. But the profile in the Americas is, of course, more heavily weighted towards make as we think about the methanol unit, our derivatives in the Americas. But this will nudge us up a little bit. We started that unit back in '15 with an original design nameplate of about 1.3 million tons, now we're looking at 1.7 million tons once these expansions are finished. So low cost, great returns on capital, also allows us to do some things in support of our integration here in Clear Lake. The acquired carbon monoxide, which we talked about before. We have the expansion around the corner with acetic acid. So all that adds to our configureability options there in Clear Lake. Mark Rohr : And, Mike, as I would say with the cross point, we could be full in the United States and we're totally integrated and it would be to our advantage at that point. So there's still room to do that, beyond the 1.7 million tons, down the increment that we've pushed out with this last expansion. So, yeah, we've got great partners in hand with Mitsui. We have other friends in industry, we'd like to do something with it. So we're certainly not - it's the top thing on our list today, but it's something we continue to evaluate and look at, and we'd be willing to take that step with the unit economics where it really makes sense to our shareholders. Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean that's the important point. If we focus on high return investments and for things like methanol, it's got to really make sense from a return perspective. And when we did the plant in Clear Lake a few years ago, just as a reminder, we got 50% of the capacity for less than 50% of the capital, given some of the assets we were bringing there at the site. So, we continue to look for advantageous investments that are going to be really opportunistic for selling. Mike Leithead : And then, I guess, just following up on the return element, you talked about superior returns in organic - or sorry inorganic investment for Celanese, I was hoping maybe you could touch on the relative investment opportunity set between the two businesses, EM and asset yields, either in terms of higher returns for either business or just a broader opportunity set for you guys today? Scott Richardson : No, we've been very clear in both businesses. We really target greater than 20% returns on investments and we don't really look at either one definitely from that perspective and a lot of what we're doing - in asset yields, we've talked at length about focusing on the opportunities in the Gulf Coast, for incremental investment that really justified with productivity. And then in Engineered Materials, a lot of these are really incremental capital. So we're putting compounding lines in for Engineered Materials. It generates a lot of value that is paying back in a couple of years. So, that's really where we're prioritizing our investments right now. I think we've said we got kind of nine projects or so going right now in Engineered Materials from a capital perspective, all of those are pretty small when you look at each one individually. But as a collective program, it's pretty sizable with, again, a return profile that's better than 20%. Mark Rohr : Yes. I think the next generation for us too in EM is going to be to restructure our power base to better fit the consumption demands that we see in the future. So, right now, we're very heavily U.S. and European based in our base polymer production and we're seeing continued opportunities in Asia. We see that growth quite dramatically, which we currently satisfy from the U.S. So we think there's a whole new round of opportunities that are surfacing and will be part of the new three-year plan to think that we talked about. We'll make those investments out there and Todd's just talked about some of these. So we do believe that our investment opportunities are getting greater as we grow this company and I think it's pretty evenly split between the two. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : In Jiangsu, over a longer period of time, do you worry that environmental constraints may either close your capacity or limit your capacity in some way or limit the capacity of your suppliers, your customers. Do you view these environmental efforts over a longer period of time as a clear positive or a clear negative or neutral, you can tell for your business there? Mark Rohr : Well, Jeff, that's a great question, yes. So when we - first off we're in the Nanjing Park and it's considered one of the top two or three parks, maybe the fourth most favorable park in the entire country. So it's a very good park, it's well managed. The role that companies like Celanese play there and BASF and others as we partner with the politicians really to support their move to become more focused on safety, environmental stewardship. So we play a key role and really helping them put forth the kind of regulations and protocols we have as a corporation and the other multinationals do on that park and on organizations that work there. So that relationship is really positive. So could it end appropriately for a park like that? I suppose it could. But what we do is pretty unique and I have a hard time believing that anytime in the near future it represents moves to improve China really represent a threat to that park or a real threat to our asset base there. When you get out beyond let's say a park like a big industrial park like chemical park like Nanjing, you get to a lot of industrial parks. Industrial parks don't run that way. They have lots of mom and pop or smaller operations there and those are the ones that seem to be feeling the most pressure now. So I think it's really more customers that could be impacted as time goes on, in every going. And right now we don't have a way really to assess that. But it's something we're going to keep our eyes on. Scott Richardson : Jeff when we started planning for that site 15 years ago we really tried to build it both from our own construction belts or upstream gasification suppliers construction with an eye towards the future. So if China had an environmental regulation very similar to what we see in the western hemisphere that's what we built for. And so it's not to say that to Mark's point that you couldn't see some crack down possibly in the future but we really did built that plant with an eye for the future. Jeff Zekauskas : And in Engineered Materials, is there a few percentage points of volume growth from acquisitions in the quarter year-over-year. I don't know 4%-- 3%? Mark Rohr : There was a little bit - there was a little bit from next that rolled in this quarter versus last quarter year-over-year. Scott Richardson : Again it was pretty small. Jeff. I mean was that --it's more like 1% to 2% is probably in there. So as I talked about earlier, year-over-year when you look at on a straight volume basis it was 3%. What we're hearing from our customers and their demand is down considerably more than that. So you know if you pull that acquisition, roll that through there\u2019s more kind of \u2013 base, base is probably 4% to 5% down. We feel pretty good about that given the environment that we were in that we were able to offset that with new projects. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Q \u2013 Ghansham Panjabi : I guess first, you know on going back to the first quarter results sort of relative to your initial guidance at the time of the 4Q Earnings Report. Well, what truly surprised you the upside in the first quarter and then related to that Mark, in your prepared comments you mentioned confidence and an improvement in China and just broader underlying demand. Is that embedded in your reiteration of guidance for 2019, I am just trying to clarify. Mark Rohr : Yes, so what I would say is that we guided pretty flat \u2013 we were starting the year very, very slowly and so we were focused solely on what we could bring to the table. And so what I was pleased about is that we brought a lot to the table through the incremental productivity, through incremental sales, through mix shift that occurred in our portfolio and sort of work that went of that and you add on top of that a stronger March than we really, do we really kind of anticipate. So that kind of lifted us up a bit about over that initial kind of view we had. Now entering in this quarter and I've just outlined I think you heard there's probably $0.25of headwinds today that we didn't have last quarter that are real. So we're starting out not at 260, we're starting out more like 230ish. I mean it's that kind of that kind of spot and we've got a build back into that. What my optimism for the years was centered upon is that I really do believe that China is going to improve as we get into this year and end this year. I do believe it almost seems like the machine is trying to get started only for something and knock it off course. And we know the Chinese people well. We know that region well and our customers well. So there's a desire for them to do better. And my belief is --is as you get into the back half of this year that we'll see that machine come alive and start to ramp more of a foundation which is not only good for us but good for our affiliates and things like that. Q \u2013 Ghansham Panjabi : And for my second question kind of going back to the EM segment, volumes down 3% in the first quarter. Obviously, comparisons are much more difficult given a year about size growth in the choppiness in the macro but the trend line is nonetheless weaker over the past few quarters. I guess going back to the 4000 projects guidance for this year. What sort of visibility do you have towards that number that gives you confidence in being able to hit that? Thanks so much. Mark Rohr : Well, I think there remains this overall press to differentiate customers very much want to do new things and serve markets right away. And so what you actually see is you see that trend increasing. The flip side of that is that the numbers tend to start weighing down being a little bit smaller in size because the people are less confident in that. So we feel very good about the 4,000, we feel very good about their contribution, and that is not a function of us thinking - business itself it's going to get better, the market's going to get better, just the need for customers to differentiate themselves versus our competition. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Nicholas Cecero : This is Nicholas Cecero on for Laurence. So for Engineered Materials, you mentioned that the projects used in battery separators is expected to double again in 2019. I'm just wondering, if we should expect the current cadence of growth to continue over the next three to five years. And then maybe you can just size the potential market opportunity here? Mark Rohr : Scott, you want to try? Scott Richardson : Yes. So we do see that trend continuing, that growth trajectory is extremely strong and I mean at the end of the year its probably one of the really good bright spots we're seeing in China. We are in the process of finalizing the expansion of our GUR Ultra-high molecular weight, polyethylene unit there in Nanjing, which will help satisfy that demand in the near term but we're already looking at what is the next wave of investments because we don't see that growth trajectory changing given the focus around electric vehicles in China and the batteries playing a critical role in that growth. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : In the prepared remarks you'd pointed to seven project expansions in the EM segment. Can you kind of help us to think about the earnings power tied to them and the cadence at which they may come in over the next couple of years? Mark Rohr : Well I'd love to John, I don't have that in front of me, so you should think of all these as being small and being incremental all adding millions not tens of millions of dollars to that process all baked into that push we have to grow this thing $100 million per year which we've been doing in that scenario. So I think it's - these are small incremental step chains that make us going from 690, up in the 770 or so this year we have that number turns out to be 760 and then up from that into 850, 860 next year. So part of that. Scott Richardson : Yes. And it's really what allows it to satisfy the demand growth that we have from the project wins, that we've been very talking about in great detail in the last several years. And so I mean my point is either by this million dollar type project each one of them plus or minus. So we're not talking a huge capital for each one. John McNulty : And then I guess with regard to M&A you indicated I guess again in the preliminary remarks that the pipeline was strong for both businesses, aside from the syngas unit that you just acquired, I don't really recall a whole lot happening in the \u2013 chain, I guess how should we be thinking about the opportunities for M&A there and what types of either assets or ventures you might be considering or looking at? Scott Richardson : Well, we think in that area, there's partnership opportunities there, that are available to us at least in theory on paper. We have come very close to acquiring businesses that would be derivative like businesses that would fit our emulsions business well in the portfolio of products we sell there well, there's upstream opportunities there that could involve M&A. So anything I was trying to extend that chain laterally and also a back integrating that chain. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Mark, could you comment on the size of your investment to expand methanol at Clear Lake by 25%, as well as, the timing of that project? Mark Rohr : The timing, that's several years. I think two and 2.5 years because you've got to do the next turnaround. We haven't talked about the dollar amount but it's well less than $100 million. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Scott Richardson : Yes. So, Kevin, think of the timing similar to the startup timing with the expanded acetic acid. So there's option - there's configuration benefits with both of those units starting up about the same time, there's some recapture on the CO2 side and - hydrogen benefit at the side. So there's all kinds of integration benefits associated with this and a market point capital of the minimus and would be funded through the venture itself. Kevin McCarthy : And then I wanted to clarify a comment you made earlier regarding potential costs to separate your businesses at $50 million to $100 million. How did you reduce that cost and as a clarification is it operational cost or is it inclusive of potential tax effects as well? Mark Rohr : It's sort of all the above. I mean we look at all of the implications of everything from the credit arrangements we have in changing of those arrangements out there, the cost of the SAP systems, now you reconfigure those systems both positive and negative relative to that, people that have joint jobs and we how we deal with men and women like that and ways to take care of them. So every aspect of that we've looked at and we've got pretty good that the 100 and it's actually a number of higher than we first started looking at that, we saw ways that we can invest money and improve our ongoing operating efficiency to get that number lower. So our path has been on new productivity to pull that down and we think contemporary number today is closer to 50 for that ongoing impact. And Scott and others are working to even get that lower over time. So that's how we did it. It's not, there's no magic, - there was one thing, there's hundreds of small things that we just had to go after. Operator : Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Acetate Tow side of the house, the expectation when you - when you offer guidance for the first quarter was that it would be equivalent to the third quarter of last year which was around $65 million, you came in at $72 million. Now I noticed in the slides you talked a little bit about your dividends perhaps being a little bit larger. Can you talk - at that you also mentioned that business you believe has returned to a stabilized earnings profile. Can you provide a little more color on what went right there and what should our expectations be for that business? Mark Rohr : Yes, really a quarter-to-quarter, we had a couple of things came in a bit higher than we thought, you know price peaked up a little bit. There was just some sort of return to a normalized pricing so it's pretty flat year-over-year, but it is improvement quarter-to-quarter, we have some energy favorability with few million bucks in there, spending was down as part of our productivity initiatives came in at those things all added up to some pretty good money and then on top of that equity earnings came in a bit higher, that was a pop up that you saw there. I mean, it was settle back down in that mid 60s kind of range and we think run out the year, we have to continue look at ways to add productivity, do more productivity on arena and we'll think we'll need you to keep these earnings flat next year but I don't know if that's enough color for you, but I think the business is top performing the way we thought it would and we expect it to be flat as we end this year, year-over-year. Frank Mitsch : And just a clarification Mark. Obviously, you indicated that you thought China was going to improve and just curious is a trade deal necessary for you guys to hit that [1050] number or not? Mark Rohr : Well, it's a great question and I want you to please understand that I'm talking and this is a feeling just haven't got back from there recently on in the team and since last time over there. But if you look at the data come out of China, what you see as you see starts and stops of things. It's like momentum starts to build in something knocks it off course, momentum starts to build something knocks off course, so actually as an economy it's not sliding down. It's already taken that step down. It is trying to recover and there is not a good reason for it to be down. I mean if you go there you see this I mean it's a thriving economy still today $14 trillion economy it's going to grow 6% that's probably twice the economic contribution globally to the world it is the U.S. So to me getting that incremental $800 billion or so coming from incremental growth as Chinese economy to be critical not only for China, but it's also critical for the world. So I do believe that for the world to get better China needs to recover. And I do think the jumpstart the economy in China the trade deal needs to happen. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question. Jim Sheehan : Regarding larger scale M&A is that all in EM, is that all in the engineered plastics area or would you consider other kinds of businesses. And then on Acetate Tow, you once considered a joint venture there. What's your strategy for enhancing shareholder value from that business? Mark Rohr : So yes, when you look at the bigger deals we're looking that they tend to be more EM oriented and that's a bit of a balance equation. If you look at AC, we have more control on a growth that\u2019s the AC. And we thought we need fewer partners, we have already have a machine and we can I\u2019d like to work with people. I just do all investments and so they tend to be more EM oriented. That's what I would say there. Yes. As regards to AC, we continue to look ways to try to involve others in that we think that's the right thing to happen over a long period time. Having said that that business is directionally starting to improve and we do believe that we can get through the next year or two with flat economics. We'll see a period of time without that whether we do a deal or not with somebody else will soon start to get back on course and improve naturally. Scott Richardson : Yes. And Jim as we look at deals in Engineered Materials, they have been really are focused on deals in the engineering thermoplastic space. So other materials are similar materials to what we have today. Jim Sheehan : Terrific. And how should we think about the earnings left from the 15,000 ton expansion in Nanjing? Scott Richardson : Yes. It could be a few cents on a full year basis. Jim, it's kind of embedded in the projections that we gave as part of our four year plan last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : I'm just real quickly on the synergies you've cited there the 59. Would you like to see that I guess go to break even before any kind of you proceed forward with any kind of action in the JV transaction or our separation? Thanks. Mark Rohr : Arun, you were talking about the co-business, or the AC business? Arun Viswanathan : The AC business. Mark Rohr : Okay, yes, I'm - you guys don't like me very much for this comment. But I think you don't make money by just blowing something up, you make money only if you catalyze a unique growth profile. Right now, we have that under way for AC. We're not holding back money for AC. So I think until we started holding back money from a growth point of view, if the shareholders are getting the full value for that within the portfolio. So, we would see it as part of some catalytic event. I do believe or if there was a need for a lot more money we willing to put in place then you could rationalize it's the right thing to do to bring in a partner or do something else to try to unlock that shareholder value. Operator : Our next question is from Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura. Please proceed with your question. Matt Skowronski : This is Matt Skowronski on for Aleksey this morning. I'm just following up to Kevin's question, in the past you mentioned that CapEx in out years to 2020 plus, it's going to be around $400 million. Is that still a good number to think about, now that you have these expansion projects going on? Mark Rohr : No, it's drifting up and I don't know, I am looking at Scott. I think we've rolled out a number there. But, we'll update that shortly. I think, clearly the syngas expansions in there and that what include originally - so it'll be up a bit. Matt Skowronski : And then within engineering materials, is destocking limited to autos or were there other end markets? Mark Rohr : Primarily auto. Scott Richardson : Yes, auto electronics - probably two biggest where we saw where we really didn't see much impact in our medical business and consumer goods is actually held up pretty well also. So it's really mainly cellphone, other electronics and automotive. Mark Rohr : Thank you, Rob. The next participant will be our last question. Operator : Our last question is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Just one for me. You mentioned a pretty heavy turnaround schedule in Q2 that also seemed like you had some downtime in Q1. Does this mean that your turnaround schedule for the back half of 2019 is pretty light. And can you provide any numbers around that? Mark Rohr : Yes, it's pretty light. We have, I think we have EM outage plan in the third or fourth quarter as well. But yes, we tend to like most companies we tend to do more in the second quarter and so, it's pretty normal for us that $30 million, $40 million kind of hit in the quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chuck Kyrish for closing comments. Chuck Kyrish : We thank you for your questions and for listening in today certainly. We're available after the call to address any further that you have. And that I'll wraps this up. Rob you can close this out. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Chuck Kyrish. Thank you. You may begin. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Rob. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. With me today are Lori Ryerkerk, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliott, Senior Vice President, Acetyl Chain. Celanese Corporation distributed its second quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared remarks about the quarter on our Investor Relations website, yesterday, after the market closed. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as the prepared comments document. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Since we published our prepared comments yesterday, we will now open the line directly for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Lori, just on your implied Q4 guidance, what's driving the expected improvement in engineered materials and how much of improvement do you expect in that segment in Q4? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, David. If we look toward second half through the third quarter into fourth quarter, we do see indications that kind of the acute de-stocking that we've seen in first and second quarter is unlikely to continue. In Acetyl, although inventories are high, it really represents only a few weeks and we see some indications that there's some movement there. On engineered materials, again, talking to some of our key customers, some of the folks in Tier 2s and Tier 3s in the supply chain, especially automotive and thing, we see indications that stock levels have pulled down quite significantly in the first half, and we don't expect that to continue.  So, we're not forecasting re-stocking. [Technical Difficulty] expecting to see demand going back to more normal levels and we're suggesting that would have not as much seasonality than in fourth quarter, because we've already seen the de-stocking occur this year. Just, by way of evidence on that, if we look at our order book for July, it\u2019s already about 10% higher than it was in April at this time. So that's really the basis for our outlook for the rest of the year. David Begleiter : And just update maybe on the M&A pipeline and the transformational transaction that was discussed at the last earnings call. Lori Ryerkerk : So, we continue to look at all levels of M&A, David, both kind of small bolt-on acquisitions as well as the more transformational activity that Mark is busy looking at. On the bolt-ons, while we have so many prospects we're looking at, while we haven't found any that are delivering at the value we would like it to complete this year, but that activity will come through; and as I said, Mark continues to work on the transformational M&A, but as we told you all before, that that will come when it comes and little bit uncertain on that timing. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : In your engineered materials business, your equity income was down in the second quarter year-over-year. And, you have some strong comparisons coming up. What's the trajectory of equity income? I know that there are timing issues, having to do with oil prices. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so if we look at equity income year-over-year, we saw about a $27 million decline there, actually almost two-thirds of that, 16 million of it was really due to affiliates and of the affiliates, 10 was due to turnaround timing at Evancina [ph]. So clearly, we expect that to reverse itself. We had some weakness in other affiliates in the first -- in second quarter and in the first half, as I think we described last quarter, specifically around our China affiliates that were more exposed to auto. We've seen some strengthening of that in second quarter. So, I think going forward again, we\u2019ll see the reversing of that turnaround time in Evancina. We are seeing some strengthening in our affiliate performance. And then the remainder of that, kind of the additional 10 million year-on-year is just general market conditions, which, as I described to David's question, we do start to see some signs of starting to recover some of the demand, as we go into the second half. Jeff Zekauskas : Is acetic acid pricing in China getting better sequentially, and might it make a difference to your returns in the third quarter. Lori Ryerkerk : Well, certainly if it gets better, it only makes a difference to our returns in the third quarter. I think indications we've had in the last few weeks is, we are starting to see some firming of pricing in acetic acid. Things move around most, so whether that\u2019s sustained or not, I think is a question.  Scott, do you have any comments you want to make around acetic acid pricing going forward? Scott Richardson : Yeah, Jeff, the demand situation in China is probably the most important thing to watch. We saw demand come off by at least 10%, probably more than that for acetic acid up sequentially, Q1 to Q2, that's an industry comment, not a Celanese comment. But, that's weighed on demand conditions, of course and then therefore pricing conditions and pull-down utilization rates in the second quarter. We're watching it very closely, we\u2019ve pivoted our business to derivatives, mainly vinyl acetate and emulsions and have grown that space by 9% sequentially on volumes, and that's lifted the overall Acetyl business by about 2% sequentially. But to your point, we're watching China price, we\u2019re heavily involved, of course, in that part of the world, and demand is a key thing to watch at this stage. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Bob Koort : I was wondering if you could give us some breakdown of your CapEx, you talked about 0.5 billion in 2021. Can you give us those buckets in terms of maintenance or cost reduction activity, and then gross spending in maybe some of the highlighted projects that are in there? Lori Ryerkerk : So if we look at where we are in, let me just start with \u201819, so in \u201819, we're approaching 400 million in CapEx. If you look at where that's being spent, about 50% of it is in EHS and what I call maintained margin projects. So turnaround, reliability-related projects, maintaining the equipment to basically maintain where we are, about 25% of it\u2019s in cost reduction projects. And I think what\u2019s significant about that is that it\u2019s about three times more than we've had in previous years and that really reflects our continued focus on helping ourselves, if you will, through productivity by doing relatively minor investments, so that yields large future cost savings.  And then about 25% is in revenue generated. Now, as you go forward, and you\u2019re seeing that number getting closer to 500 million, all of that growth is really in revenue generation. So it really is \u2013 and/or productivity. So, it is projects like methanol expansion, it\u2019s projects like the VAM expansions we\u2019ve done, we have additional compounding lines starting up as we go forward as well as some de-bottlenecking activity in various polymers in the US and in Europe and in Asia, actually in all three regions. So, the real growth is all in revenue generating activities, either volume and/or productivity, and in almost all cases we can trade off productivity for volume. Scott Richardson : Yeah. Bob, I think on a go forward basis, I think what I would bake in there on that is about 150 million of MOB type CapEx and the rest is exactly what Lori talked about from a cost reduction and rev gen standpoint. But, we look at the entire bucket of CapEx and the returns we generate on that entire bucket, inclusive of MOB, at 20%, greater than 20% return. So that's kind of what I would bake in on a go forward basis. Bob Koort : Can I ask on the EM side? You guys had some pretty explosive growth there 4, 6, 8 quarters ago, it started to slow. And then you're also battling maybe on raw material pressures and being more selective on your pricing. Well, this quarter, it looks like both volume and price got dinged. I guess I could see the volume side. But can you talk a little more about what's going on in price and maybe how your pricing in EM correlates to what's happening in the raw material? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah so, if we look at engineered materials, we do see, as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve seen a decline in auto demand, we've seen the decline in electronics demand. Clearly in some areas, especially nylon, for example and elastomers, which has been heavily challenged by those declines, we have seen a lot of competitors in the market driving price down. And we've seen a lot of pricing being done to compete for volume. Now, we haven't followed that all the way down. And obviously, that's why our volumes are somewhat off in those areas. But we have seen some pricing pressure, especially in those areas and especially as it applies to automotive.  What I would say there, nylon and elastomers are heavily impacted by the M&A we had over the last two or three years. So that's also kind of a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, we're not, we haven't had any significant M&A in the last year. So that is a change from say, the past several years. And what we see with our affiliates is while we're happy overall with their financial performance, a lot of the volume that came in with, sorry, not with our affiliates, those are acquisitions, a lot of the volume that came in with our acquisitions were not as differentiated as our base portfolio, not generated using the same project model and therefore not as sticky as some of our base portfolio. So, as we've gotten into this more challenging economic backdrop, we've seen some of those volumes not be as resilient as our base portfolio. Over time, we expect that to change as we are developing those volumes consistent with our business model. But we have seen those influences come together in this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Just a question around your capacity in acetyls in Asia, there were some reports during the quarter that you were taking your own utilization rates down. So, could you discuss that a little bit and then help us understand where rates are now in the third quarter and where you expect them to be? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So maybe, I'll start and ask Todd to weigh in more specifically. I mean, in \u2013 generally in acetic acid in China, we are seeing a demand decline of more than 10% in the second quarter and that put China capacity utilizations around 70%. And that's versus, if you go back say a year ago, that was well in to the mid-80s or even a little bit higher. So, we're certain utilization is significantly down in China, in general. Our own capacity, I'll let Todd come on, on that. But I will say, we did see some other producers in China take units down entirely and take capacity back in response to that, as that combined with kind of historically low level of pricing made it unaffordable for folks to run.  Maybe Todd, do you have comments on that operations? Todd Elliott : Vincent, we black power Acetyl\u2019s network on a daily basis. I mean, this is what we do every day and every week and every month, try to get into and try to get to maximum value we can in each of the products and we did a great deal of that in Q2. Our activations were up 30% sequentially and this is our measurement of really actions and decisions that we take to just flex our network in the best way. So remember, we had a couple of turnarounds in the system in Q2, we had a vinyl acetate turnaround in Bay City, as well as in Nanjing, so that kept VAM rates lower in those two units.  Acetic acid wise, if you look out a little bit, we do have turnarounds, the first part of a turnaround in Singapore toward the end of this quarter, Q3 and then mainly into Q4. So without giving specific rates by unit, I think the key takeaway is our flexibility, our ability to pivot, whether acetic acid or derivatives, is really the differentiation that we would point to. So, we intentionally moved plus 5% of our acetic acid tonnage downstream to our derivatives.  So we shifted to VAM, shifted to emulsions 5% sequentially. That allowed us to grow VAM and emulsions by 9% volumetrically from Q1 to Q2 and then therefore lifting the overall chain by 2% sequentially. So those choices, those options and choices are what we would point to and really the end result is profitability, 189 million, if you would take out the turnaround that I mentioned before, which were about 15 million of headwind in the quarter, plus it's about that $200 million run rate for the business on a quarterly basis, while keeping EBIT margins above 20%. Vincent Andrews : If I could just ask in EM, on the volume side of the equation, you call it a couple of things that a little more color would be helpful. One, it sounded like in the first quarter, there was an inventory bill from some of the healthcare customers, can you just kind of help us understand how that volume does swing around from quarter to quarter. It seemed like in the first quarter, volume was strong, if I go back and look at the comments from them. So, how does that work if their volume shifts around? And then secondly, I think there was a comment that volume was also hurt by a mix effect. If you could just help us understand what that is? Lori Ryerkerk : And actually, those are really the same things. It continues to be a very strong sector for us, but it is a very relatively small volume sector with very high margin. And so actually small swings in volume can have a very big impact on our earnings. And what we saw in the first quarter is we did see customers, particularly in the UK building volume, in anticipation of a Brexit move, but it didn't happen, worrying about tariffs and availability and everything else relative to Brexit.  And what it does again, it's not a huge volume, but it's going to good bit of the margin. If you look at our EM kind of quarter-to-quarter, first quarter to second quarter, of what we say is a volumetric impact, is of that volumetric impact, so 7% of the volumetric impact, 4% of that was actual EM volume, 3% was just the mix with most of that being medical. So just the fact that medical volumes got moved into the first quarter from second quarter, we see this from time to time, it was particularly big first to second quarter, but medical tends to be a bit lumpy. If we get a big order, once we had FDA approval and people will dock up as they prepare for run, and then they'll go down. So, it tends to be a bit lumpy or maybe there's some of our other business that we did see the first to second quarter, primarily because of the Brexit impact. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Mike Sison : In terms of the Acetyl Chain, just curious, you guys, as you've talked about do a good job pivoting, seeing upstream, downstream geographically. And so if you think about the second half of the year, where do you think you're going to need to pivot to make your earnings outlook for the year, and maybe it's hard to say, but just any current that you\u2019re going to stay downstream, that type of thought? Lori Ryerkerk : So on the Acetyl chain, quite frankly, we're quite pleased with where we are, I mean, continuing to turn in, seven consecutive quarters above 20%. And I think the second quarter is really just a good example of the strength of the model in Acetyl and the ability to have optimization to continuously do activations, as Todd just described, most value at wherever it exists beyond the chain. I think, an interesting point and maybe a bit to your question, if you look at the very low pricing we're seeing in Acetyls in China less, than $400 a ton, the last time we saw this level of pricing was back in first quarter of \u201817. And if you look at the earnings in first quarter \u201917 for Acetyl, it was 109 million.  You compare that to the second quarter now at 189 million, we've had an $80 million uplift in the value of the Acetyl chain in basically the same economic conditions based on the strength of the model and the focus on productivity and all of the other steps. Put another way, margins on Acetyl went from 14% in first quarter \u201917 to now 22% in second quarter \u201819. So I think that really speaks to the strength of the Acetyl Chain. Really to achieve that 10.50 [ph] view for the year, it's really just continuing to activate that model and continuing to deliver on that 200 level quarter-on-quarter. And obviously, if we were to get for whatever reason, a good run up in the price of acetic acid in China in particular, that would just be more on top of that. Mike Sison : And then as a quick follow up, in terms of EPS, you did about, like $5 in the first half. And adjusted EBIT about, close to 800. So, if you look at the second half, you need a little bit more obviously in EPS by 50. This year, just the EBIT have to go up a lot in the second half to do better, or is it -- maybe just a thought on how the second half adjusted EBIT looks relative to the first half? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, we are assuming some improvement in market conditions based on my earlier comments. So obviously, EBIT will go with that. But, clearly, also on an EPS basis, we\u2019re helped by the share buybacks that we've had in the first half of this year as well as last year. But let me turn it over to Scott to maybe give a more complete answer. Scott Richardson : Yeah, I think that's really the point. I think we do need a slight improvement in the adjusted EBIT and I think Lori talked earlier about how to expect that, given the de-stocking we saw in the first half, that we believe the second half can be better. Order book, starting out in July, a little better than we saw, particularly in the second quarter. And then just what we saw in the first half of this year, we're currently not baking in the same level of Q4 seasonality. So, when you kind of take all those things into consideration, you did have slightly a better adjusted EBIT in the second half plus the benefit of the buybacks we did in the first half and what we expect to do in the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. John Roberts : Methanex is going forward with its third unit in Geismar. Todd, could you give us an update on the Fairway Methanol expansions that you're doing with Mitsui? Todd Elliott : Yeah. Thanks, John. As we announced last quarter, our plan is to take that unit up to 1.7 million tons. That would be operational sometime in 2022. We're pleased with the output of that unit that continues to contribute value, is it running above the original design capacity. But we're on track again to raise that up by about 150,000 tons that would be shared with our partner and again, on track towards 1.7 million by 2022 and we\u2019ll update that specific timing as we work through the progress. We did receive the requisite permit from Texas to proceed down the path here. John Roberts : Okay, and then Lori or Scott, in the engineered materials business, could you share with us how much the automotive business was actually down during the second quarter? Was it down double digit percent? Lori Ryerkerk : So, if you look at automotive bills, we actually saw about a 3% drop, most of that coming entirely out of it. The US was actually up a little bit on the spring, so trust that EU was down. Of course, bills is interesting, but what really matters to us is what we're, what the demand for product is, and there, in our discussion with the tier 2 and 3 suppliers to auto in all regions, we were hearing from some of our key customers and distributors declines of 20% to 30% on volume. So clearly, an indication to us that de-stocking was continuing into the second quarter. John Roberts : Were you down in line with those tier 2 discussions that you had? Lori Ryerkerk : No, our EM volume on an -- actual volume was down about 4% in total. Scott Richardson : Yeah. And John, auto, the auto piece of that was just, maybe about a percentage point higher than that. Operator : Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar: Lori, as a center of gravity for Acetyl shifts to the US and at the same time, for EM, the focus of growth seems to be China, does that mean that there would be less integration between the two businesses going forward? Lori Ryerkerk : It was an interesting question. P.J. I don't think there's less integration going forward. I mean, we have raw materials available in China, there's plenty of acetic acid producers. It just may mean that less of our own material is going into EM in China, but we continue to have a growing EM business in the US. So, I don't see it having a significant change in terms of the amount of integration between the two businesses. P.J. Juvekar: And as acetic acid prices drop, you nicely pivoted to VAM and emulsions. And so that's a great tactical move from your team. But when do competitors catch up with that move, or are they not that flexible, because I would imagine that these are big, large companies that are global, and they should be able to do the same thing? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so, the interesting thing is, I think, there aren't any competitors who can do the same thing. I mean, that's the beauty of our integrated model. I mean, there's a lot of competitors who make acetic acid, there are competitors who make VAM and there are competitors who make emulsions, there's not many who make all three from the start of the value chain [indiscernible] and methanol all the way through emulsions. And that's really where our model is, I think, differentiated from others and is strong and allows us to give less volatile results and this level of earning is because we are fully integrated to the chain and fully integrated geographically, which not all of our competitors are. So, we have the ability as we did this quarter to reduce our exposure to Asia and increase our sales into the Western Hemisphere, where margins -- available margins were higher for VAM and emulsions. Operator : Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays Bank. Duffy Fischer : A question around Lori's comment that your $80 million a quarter better now in this kind of a tough acetic \u2013 Acetyl\u2019s market than you were in Q1 of 17. It would strike me that that's got to be one of three factors either better realized price versus the posted price, better cost or you're selling more volume into the market? Can you break it down into those three buckets that $80 million? Where does the majority of it come from? And how much do you think is structural versus maybe just some transitory fortunate business? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, so Duffy, I mean, I think we work very hard for these results. So what I would tell you is, I don't have the exact breakdown in front of me. I mean, it's a little bit of all of it. But it really is the ability to flex our model and make choices about where we take value out of the chain. So it's certainly price and the price we're realizing for VAM and emulsions, if you will, versus acetic acid. But, I think the point is, it is the strength of value chain, the strength of the geographic model, and the talent of our folks, if you will, to be able to constantly flex and make decisions every day about where to extract value in that chain, which makes us confident that we can continue to deliver these results, even in periods of low margin environment like we've seen in the second quarter. Scott Richardson : Yeah. And Duffy, I could add, remember, we've added integration with methanol, we've added integration more recently with carbon monoxide, we expanded our vinyl acetate unit in Clear Lake by 150,000 tons. We've achieved more options, frankly, with this global network that Lori just outlined. So it's really the combination of that and the real time use of data, which provides us insights to make these calls, these activations to affect these decisions that contribute to the results we believe is repeatable and we're going to look to add additional value steps going forward. John asked the question about the methanol expansion, there's other value addition steps that we're pursuing, and [indiscernible]. Lori Ryerkerk : And I think we shouldn't ignore productivity, I mean, for Celanese, we are delivering about 100 million a year in productivity steps. So again, roughly kind of 50-50, that certainly doing that year on year on year is making us more competitive as well, lowering our overall cost base. Duffy Fischer : And then, does the market believes that the coal gasification explosion at EMA is going to be a big deal for the acetic acid in the Acetyl\u2019s market in China. Scott Richardson : Yeah, Duffy, I think it's too early to get into that. And it's a terrible, terrible thing, many, many lives lost and multiple injuries in there and then on province, there's something like 11% of domestic Chinese capacity in that province. So it's a, from a country perspective, that province is a big producer. This particular unit was only a couple of hundred thousand tons, so call it two percent or so of the domestic capacity. So we're watching that, we're \u2013 it remains to be seen what the province does across the other units in [indiscernible] and what are the steps they take to curtail operations there. We're focused on what we can do with our customers to keep our efforts and business connected, and ultimately, work to Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Two quick ones. First on the uptick in the order book that you've seen recently. Can you give a sense for how broad basis is this or if there's any particular regions that are stronger than others, in terms of the pace of improvement? And secondly, on productivity and turnarounds, is there any lumpiness that we should be thinking about for 2020 and 2021 in terms of timing of outages going forward? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so on the order book, we're seeing it fairly broadly, I would say, because of the declines we saw in second quarter, I mean, it's probably more noticeable in some of those grades, nylon, elastomers that I talked about. We\u2019ve seen good recovery in palm, good recovery in [indiscernible]. So I'd say, it's pretty broad across the different grades that we make in the order book and then also pretty spread between the regions at this point. Scott Richardson : Yeah. On turnarounds, Laurence, we're doing that work right now on kind of planting that up across the corporation as we do turnaround planning and we\u2019ll provide more insight into that probably in October. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning. And Lori, congratulations again on your new role. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess going back to your EPS guidance iteration for \u201819, and sort of the embedded expectation for improved demand fundamentals as per your comps in the press release, are you basically assuming that the inventory destocking, the pressure in the first half is now behind you? Or are you assuming any sort of acceleration in end market volumes, including in the EM segment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So that assumption is, we are assuming that de-stocking is pretty much behind us. Now, we're not assuming any re-stocking if you will. We're really assuming a return to normal demand in the third and fourth quarter and some assumption around not the amount of seasonality in fourth quarter we usually see for destocking, because we believe the de-stocking has already occurred. Ghansham Panjabi : And then just in terms of some of the supply chains for markets such as electronics, perhaps moving away from China into other parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, at least directionally, how are you sort of balancing your focus on expanding your VM footprint in China? Would you call that in your prepared comments, versus some of the other regions across Southeast Asia more broadly? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so we are very focused on expanding [Technical Difficulty] China, and not just our sales. I mean, I think if you go back historically, most of our EM business in China really started with following big auto, if you will, into China and people that we supplied in other regions of the world, whether it be Europe or the US, basically supplying the same materials into China. And so it's very much on exporting material from the US, exporting from Europe into China. So if you look at it, the large percentage of our EM materials, in fact, quite the majority are not just produced, but also compounded outside of Asia, and then imported, into Asia and into China.  That worked when we were doing a lot of auto and things that had long lead times and things that had pretty long life. But if you look at our business now and especially as you go into consumer and electronics and things that maybe change every six months to a year, it's just not a supply chain that can meet our customer demand to get products more quickly, development more quickly. So we are already -- have a couple of projects going in this year to add compounding line in China. And our future capital program over the next few years is focusing on adding poly as well as additional compounding in China really to shorten the supply chain to meet the needs of our current customers in China and the rest of Asia. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Lori, in your prepared remarks, you had highlighted the ability to accelerate some of the actions around cost cutting. Can you quantify or give us a magnitude as to what you can pull forward to 2019 this year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so we pulled forward about 60 million, let's call it, of capital projects, capital thin. So, to give you an example, these are things like retrofitting and refurbishing natural gas boilers to get better energy efficiency at plants. I mean, these are things that, we won't necessarily see the payout this year, but we'll see the payout next year and the years that follow. But to give you an idea on productivity, the combination of capital projects and other productivity, where we had been doing a run rate of about 100 million a year on productivity, that number for this year will be between 150 to 200. So we've been able to pull in, call it 50 million to 100 million on a full year basis now, obviously, not all was implemented January 1, so we won't get all of it this year, but, call it 50 million to 100 million. John McNulty : And then with regard to EM, I guess, how much or what percent roughly of your products can be kind of swapped out quickly, if there is competition around pricing, because it does sound like that may have been a little bit of an issue. And then how much of it\u2019s really kind of specked in [ph] and it's really tough to displace around random price cuts or lapses in discipline. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I'm not sure I know the exact numbers. I\u2019ll ask Scott to back me up here, but right now, I would say, it's probably, a third of it\u2019s really very sticky, I mean very, very hard, a third of it is specked in, but probably others could be or either already specked in and could be and then a third of it is more, what I'll call, me too kind of product, which is easier for people to come in and out of based on price. Scott Richardson : Yeah, I think that's exactly right. John, we're \u2013 I mean, about a third of the business is a little bit more transactional, it's still an engineered solution. So it's not something that changes, I mean, from one day to the next. But it can be switched out. The reality of it too, is, we can also switch out between polymers. So that's an opportunity for us as well, depending on, where various raw materials are and given the breadth of our portfolio now, and the fact that we have over 20 different polymer families that we can go into, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in this market, depending on where raw materials are in the more transactional spaces. But it continues to be important for us as we build a project pipeline and really start to try to put more focus on that specked in, sticky business that Lori talked about. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : A question on the Acetyl\u2019s industry. As we look at some of the trends, it seems to us that there's a relatively large number of outages across the industry in recent months, recent quarters. My question is, do you agree with that? And if so, do you have a sense for how much or how many of these outages are maintenance related among your competitors versus, caused by economic reasons, with market prices, thinking, do you see competitors throttling back simply because, they go cash negative, for example? Lori Ryerkerk : It's always a little bit hard to say, but let me ask Todd to follow up my comment. We know in China that some capacity has been intentionally shut down due to the combination of demand and pricing. Second quarter is traditionally a fairly heavy turnaround quarter as well. So, certainly in the US and in Asia, we see some taken out. Now, having to run operations for 35 years, I can tell you, people make a lot of decisions around extending maintenance outages and doing them at a slower pace and things when economics are like they are now. So, it's always a little bit unclear about how much is economic versus how much is maintenance. But certainly we've seen both. Todd, you may have more specific. Todd Elliott : Yeah, Kevin, it's a good question. And to Lori's point is, it's hard to know the exact figure. But if we were to try and track utilization rates, with that, demand dropped sequentially by over 10% in acetic acid Q1 to Q2, we believe that would have pulled utilization rates down on a global basis to just under 80%, so call it around 79%, with China actually dipping under 70% utilization rate. So on the heels of that, to your question, to your point, we do believe kind of intentional curtailment occurred late in Q2, we would call a run rate typically around 300,000 tons of sort of normal outages, we think that that might have doubled, if you kind of ramp it up and factor all that in, it's, again, hard to be absolutely precise here.  But there had to have been some intentional action, we certainly do our part with our own network. And that's what we do to take care of our customers and also to maximize value for shareholders all the time. So, there were some curtailments indeed and as we go into Q3, that's important to track and watch and really sets the tone for improvement as we go into the second half of the year. But demand is critically important. We've got to focus on demand conditions and starting to see that that industrial space, particularly in China, starting to recover and that will help a lot, really all of our businesses. Kevin McCarthy : And then as a follow up, again, sticking with Acetyls, what are your latest thoughts on rationalization of Celanese\u2019s capacity in Asia? Do you need to get through IMO 2020 and really see how the fuel markets react in Singapore? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I mean, we've announced our intention to do an acetic gas reconfiguration. We are still progressing with that project, but ultimately the decision, it is based on productivity by the way, it is based about utilizing lower raw material costs in the US Gulf Coast and taking capacity out of Asia. But that decision of where to take capacity at Asia will depend on exactly what you said, where do we end up with bunker fuel pricing, what does that mean for Singapore capacity? Where does coal pricing go? What does that mean for Nanjing margins? And we'll make that decision at that time, based upon where we are on both of those. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I just wanted to go back to the guidance for both Q3 and Q4, I guess looking at Q3, between Q1 and Q2, would put it maybe at 250. And then, your statement is in the past to the 1050. So that would probably be around $3 [ph]. Just, I just want to understand that path a little bit more. I guess, the mechanics would be both Acetyls and EM going up and margins and price and volume, where you see the greatest confidence in that path? Is it in EM or Acetyls and where do you see the risk factors as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So, the thing we\u2019ve said, we really feel confident in our ability to continue to deliver Acetyls in the 200 range. Clearly, if we see firming in acetic acid pricing, as we've had some indications, if that\u2019s sustained, that could be further upside for Acetyl. And for all the reasons we discussed earlier, around de-stocking, et cetera, we expect to see recovery in engineered materials, as we go forward through the end of the year. And then of course, since we're talking earnings per share, we also have the impact of the share buyback and seeing kind of the full year impact of that on the numbers. Arun Viswanathan : And, do you also expect to update your longer term targets that you provided last year for \u201918 through \u201820 at some point? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so we're working out through a strategy refresh, we\u2019ll be working through that through the end of the year, clearly, part of that will be to look at 2020 again, and kind of relook at our view for 2020. So hopefully, in the October timeframe, we'll have that certainly, as we work through the strategy into the end of the year, we\u2019ll have a view of 2020 as well as the out years beyond that. Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov with Nomura. Alex Yefremov : In engineered materials, how should we think about your margin sustainability? Was the level of margins for wholly owned business in the first half representative of what you could see in the second half? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think, for all the reasons we described, I think we expect second half to be stronger for engineered materials than it was for first half. I think certainly for our acquired businesses, we expect further strengthening in those business models and the delivery against the models for those going forward as well as the general improvement with the market conditions, with not anticipating further destocking. So I think for our own businesses, as well as for our affiliates, but especially for our own businesses, we expect a stronger second half than first half. Scott Richardson : Yeah, and Alexi just, typically volumes are strongest in Asia in Q4, margins are a little bit lower there versus the Western Hemisphere, just with Chinese New Year in Q1, kind of moving into that timeframe. So typically, our Q4 margins are a little bit lower. So that would be something to keep in mind as well. Alex Yefremov : As a follow up, you guided third quarter between first, somewhere between first and second quarter, should we think about that guidance as sort of the midpoint, or are you kind of closer to the first quarter level or the second quarter level in your thinking about 3Q? Scott Richardson : Alexi, I think, we're still fairly early as we start the quarter. And so, I think it can really be how demand materializes. I think there has been some pretty public announcements from some of that, for example, automakers taking some or shut downs. But, we do expect to kind of more or less destocking coming to an end as we talked about. So, it's in that range and, as we work our way through the quarter, we\u2019ll have a better idea on where we finish, but it's somewhere in that range. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson. Jim Sheehan : Share buybacks were pretty robust in the quarter, are you still targeting around a 7% share count reduction for the year? It does seem like you're on track to do even more possibly. Scott Richardson : Yeah, Jim, we've been very open about the fact we're going to be opportunistic with share buybacks. We expect this year to be in the range of where we were in 2018. We did 800 million in 2018 and we expect to be in that general range, with finishing the first half at 500 million, in the last 12 months, we bought back about 9% of the outstanding share. Jim Sheehan : And on the full year outlook, $10.50, you're assuming an acceleration of sorts in the fourth quarter. If you don't see that uptick, what kind of downside do you see for full year 2019? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so if we were to see market conditions continue similar to the first half, then we would expect our earnings per share to be down 3% to 5%. Chuck Kyrish : Bob, we\u2019ll make the next question our final question. Operator : Our last question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : Could you talk about how the month of June performed relative to the entire second quarter for both Acetyl Chain and engineered materials? It kind of sounds like maybe June was the strongest month of the quarter in EM, but potentially one of the weakest month in Acetyl Chain? Is that the right way to think about it? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so let me talk about EM. So, typically the last month of the quarter is the strongest quarter for EM. That's just typical. So just the way people run their businesses. So definitely, I think June was, actually probably not our strongest month in the second quarter, but it was a good quarter for us in June. Interestingly enough, we actually saw an increase in auto in China in June, the first increase in sales, in terms of auto sales that's occurred for, since May of last year in China.  We don't necessarily think that\u2019s sustainable because it was faced with very heavy discounting going on in China to move vehicles that won't meet the new air emission standards that are going into place. So, June was a bit of an interesting month. So, some areas of strength, some areas of weakness, I\u2019d say for EM, not, a good month for the end of -- a good month, but not atypical for the end of the quarter. I think in Acetyls, I don't know that it was significantly different. I can ask Todd to comment, I don't actually think it was particularly strong or weak as comparison to the rest of the quarter. Todd, do you have any? Todd Elliott : No. That's good. I think that's right. I mean, the middle of month was probably the lowest of the three, but not to your point, pretty balanced overall. Matthew Blair : And then Todd, could you talk about the Chinese VAM market so far in Q3. It looks like pricing might have come off quite a bit already this quarter. There's been some reports of economic run cuts from some of the major producers, including Celanese, do you have any more color there. Todd Elliott : Well, again, similar to the comments from before, with respect to our operational activity, so, we will flex our unit, as we see the match with customer needs, customer demand, cost, profitability. So we'll do that in all units around the world. That flexibility is important for us. So I would not characterize VAM China as declining at this point. I think it's been fairly healthy as we go Q2 to Q3, more to come and certainly we got to watch the development over the course of the quarter. But no, I think that was a little too severe of a characterization in terms of the Q to Q drop. So, we're working hard to deliver the quarter in Q3 as we outlined before. So, the one thing we do have to navigate through, we do have a turnaround in Q3 in Frankfurt on VAM, so we've got probably a 10 million headwind there that we've got to work around, but that's probably the one thing from an operational perspective we've got to work through. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Chuck Kyrish for closing comments. Chuck Kyrish : Thanks, Rob. Certainly, we would like to thank everyone for listening in today and the good questions. As usual, we\u2019re around after the call to address other questions that you have and Rob, with that, you can close this out. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Christine. Good morning and welcome to Celanese Corporation third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. With me today are Lori Ryerkerk, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliott, Senior Vice President, Acetyl Chain. Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared remarks about the quarter on our Investor Relations website, yesterday, after market close. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release, as well as the prepared comments document. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Since we published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open the line directly for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Due to time constraints, we ask that all callers limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, you may requeue and those questions will be addressed time permitting. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Sorry, had you on mute. Could you give us a bridge of -- I'm just looking at the guidance for 2020 versus your midpoint for the full year of 2019 and the low end would be 13.4% growth and the high and would be about over 20%. So if you could just help us bridge to the low end. I understand the high end would require some economic improvement. We all understand what that would be. Lori Ryerkerk : Vincent, thank you. Look, let me start with what we said last quarter where we bridged kind of from the $10.50 to the $12, because I'm going to use the same factors. If you remember when we were going from $10.50 to $12, we kind of said it was a-third market demand business growth a-third -- sorry, a-third productivity and a \u2013third from our cash deployment, whether that would be M&A or share buyback. So if we look at this year, excluding the impacts of Clear Lake, we feel like the year would end around $10. And so, if we add productivity to that, that's $0.50. If we add another -- if we add the cash deployment to that, again, that can be either M&A or share buyback, that's another $0.50. That gets us to the $11. So the $11 that we reflected in that outlook for 2020 is assuming basically current market conditions. Obviously, if we get any upside going forward from an improved demand environment or price, that can move us towards the $12. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And as a follow-up, when we think about engineered materials into next year, the volume has been trending lower. And you talked about destocking last quarter and maybe this quarter there's a bit of residual destocking. But as we enter into 4Q, should we start to see volume turn positive again? And what type of volume growth do you think you can expect for 2020? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So for engineered materials, I mean, we are up sequentially on volume second quarter to third quarter. We saw the volume up about 3%. So the residual destocking that we referred to was really pretty specific to Europe where we saw autos decline another 15% quarter-on-quarter. So that's really specific. I would say, consistent with what we said last quarter, we really didn't see size of destocking in China. In fact, we saw volume growth in China. And the U.S. stayed flattish, so we think we were at the bottom of the destocking last quarter. So really the residual destocking was just in Europe. So for engineered materials, volume up second quarter to third quarter by about 3%. Going into the fourth quarter, I don't know that we'll see volume growth. We see some seasonality, typically in the fourth quarter. We see China continue to grow in advance of their first quarter holiday. But typically in the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see slowdown. So I don't expect volume growth third quarter to fourth quarter, but certainly we expect volume growth based on the project wins that we've had this year, as well as just normal seasonality into first quarter next year. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. What was your -- how many shares did you buy back in the third quarter? Scott Richardson : Yes. Jeff, so we bought about $275 million worth of shares and that was at roughly a price a little over -- between $105 and $106 a share. So that's kind of where we finished and we expect to finish the year at about $1 billion of repurchases for calendar year 2019. Jeff Zekauskas : So I assume that means that you bought no shares in September, is that right? Lori Ryerkerk : No, we've been steadily buying shares that since September. You know, prior to that we were more opportunistically buying them but since then we've just had a steady pattern of repurchase. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Lori, when you think about leverage to maybe better times and the extra dollars is that dollar to $12 -- I'm sorry is the extra dollar per share to $12 kind of evenly split between the Acetyl Chain and EM? And what do you think needs to happen in terms of those segments to, sort of, get that extra push? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, Mike I think that's right. The -- I would say it's pretty much evenly split between Acetyls and EM. You know, we don't expect any year-on-year growth, obviously, in Acetate Tow. So -- in acetyls that growth, of course, we're already assuming no impact from Clear Lake, but that growth really probably comes from tightness in the market and improved pricing into next year. In EM, I would say it comes from volume with no destocking and starting to move closer to a return to normalcy in terms of market conditions and demand. Mike Sison : Right. And then in terms of acquisitions given that it is an area that could boost earnings next year any thoughts on the environment size? Where do you think the opportunities are focused on going forward? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So if you look at our use of cash first -- our first priority is really organic investment. And if you look, of course, this year we are up against $400 million for CapEx. Next year that goes up to $500 million and that's really investment organically in ourselves in growth projects and productivity projects. So that's kind of the first use of cash next year. M&A we continue to look at everything bolt-on acquisitions to transformational. Look we haven't found anything yet this year we wanted to invest in quite frankly because we have a lot of people wanting to get 2018 kind of multiples when we're in the 2019 price environment. So we're only going to do an M&A if it makes sense and it's the right price and it adds value to the shareholder and we just haven't found that. So if we look forward into next year we're going to continue to look for opportunity. Clearly our main focus is on the EM side trying to acquire additional molecules or different technologies or additional geographies that we want to be in. But quite frankly we don't have anything lined up at this point. We just continue to look to see what's out there and talk to various companies that we think would be attractive. Mike Sison : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Lori, could you talk a little bit about\u2026 Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning, Bob. Bob Koort : \u2026maybe some specifics on the supply chain improvements you got teed up in Engineering Materials? What, sort of, efforts are you making there? Can you give us some granularity on exactly what you're doing there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So Bob, really as we've grown our EM volumes and particularly after we had the acquisitions over the last couple of years in nylon and TPE and a few other product lines we really found we were straining our supply chain system because we've added a lot of SKUs. We've had a lot of small volume materials. And while this is good for earnings it has been a strain on our supply chain system as it exists today which is largely manual or self-spreadsheet base. And so really we stepped back and said, okay, what do we need to do right now to make sure we continue to deliver high-quality product to our customers on time? And so we've taken efforts over the last six to nine months really to strengthen our existing systems. So we've added some people. We've added some processes to really continue to do it manually, but to do it more effectively and more efficiently. Our next phase is really -- and that's kept us running well and kept us in good shape with our customers. But our next phase is really to try to automate that. So we're looking at more IT overlay, more use of for example better forecasting, using statistics versus the very manual process we have, an IT system that handles skew better, adding bar coding at our site where we don't have it to make this all more automated. And so that effort is going on now Phase 2. We're working with a consultant to really identify the systems and the pathway to do that. And that should be completed over the next 12 months to 18 months. Bob Koort : Got you. And could you give us on the acetic acid side maybe a look around the world in terms of operating rates? And I'm particularly curious in China. I know you guys have talked in the past about maybe seeing a few more plants there might come out of the market and help tighten things. Where does that stand these days? And I guess, I saw your main rival there is thinking about adding one million ton plant in China. So what's sort of the outlook you guys see there? Lori Ryerkerk : So, I think if you look over the last few years we've seen a few plants come out for environmental and other reasons in China. We haven't really seen any build. As we have we've seen a few people maybe crude capacity a bit. But I'd say volume supply has been flat to maybe slightly declining in Asia and really around the world. We also saw the announcement obviously that would take some time to get built and maybe I'll ask Todd to comment more specifically. But generally, I'd say we've seen supply be fairly stable. Now, in 2018, there was a lot of outages in the industry which helped tighten supply a bit. This year we've not seen as many outages. So, going forward again other than our expansion in Clear Lake now the one that's just been announced we haven't seen any other builds going on. And quite frankly the economics for most people haven't supported builds other than the kinds of things we've been able to do with capacity creep and very economical builds versus Greenfield builds. So, Todd do you want to-- Todd Elliott : Yes Bob. Hey, it's Todd Elliott. We're tracking with our reconfiguration project in Clear Lake. Of course we're adding about 800,000 tons there in Clear Lake by 2022. So, permits in place both for that as well as the methanol expansion plan for Clear Lake. So, that tracks. That will we think be the first world-scale best technology unit that hits the marketplace in the near-term. So, we're tracking towards that date. More specifically to your question today if you just look at utilization rates I think you are focused mainly on China. Of course, 2018, we saw utilization rates around the world push up in the 90% range both globally as well as in China. China fell down to the probably under 70% utilization rates for most of this year. We saw that nudge up towards the end of Q3. We would call utilization in China around 70% and then towards the end of Q3 probably around 75%. So, we actually saw some improvement. Some of that was supply related due to some supply disruptions as well as this improved demand prior to the Chinese national holiday. So, a little bit better trading conditions in China at the end of Q3. We also saw pricing move up at the end of the quarter. I think the question now is is that sustainable? We're watching that of course as we -- as we're into Q4 and certainly looking for better conditions into the New Year really main focus on demand recovery. Bob Koort : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. In acetyls you drove down the inventories of the downstream products to make up for the shortfall. It sounds like you plan on rebuilding those inventories. Why not just continue with low inventories at least in the early next year given the economic backdrop here? Lori Ryerkerk : So, look we do have lower working capital this year. That is certainly helping us. Typically we have lower demand for VAM and emulsions in the fourth quarter for seasonality anyway. So, that's quite frankly why we felt comfortable driving down our inventory. Look it's just a choice point. Typically we see a good pickup in first quarter. And there's little raw material costing right now, so we still think it makes sense to take advantage of that lower raw material cost and rebuild inventories to the extent we can in the fourth quarter. Todd Elliott : And maybe John -- it's Todd again just to add on. This shift to derivatives has been intentional this year. I mean we saw opportunities to move about 5% of our acetic acid mix downstream to either vinyl acetate or to emulsions. And I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks we're up over 15% year-over-year if you just look at our volume patterns downstream to those derivatives. We think that that's been a positive move that's allowed us to keep earnings up around $190 million all year really since Q1 all the way through and maintaining margins above 20% on an EBITDA as a percentage of sales basis. So that intentional shift to derivatives we think has been the right call from an activation perspective this year as we saw better opportunities in those trading conditions. John Roberts : And then as a follow-up in engineered plastics, you cited both light-weighting of traditional vehicles and EVs as growth -- both growth drivers here. Can you just remind us of the relative Celanese content in a typical traditional vehicle versus a -- I don't know if there is one in average EV so is content higher on the EV side? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say -- so the opportunity for content is higher on the EV side because obviously you have the battery which requires film which we provide a lot of. There's also a lot more electrical connections in an EV vehicle than a traditional vehicle. So, the opportunity for content is higher on EV, but frankly, EVs are still a very small percentage of the fleet. So, we have a -- we're happy with the amount of content we currently have in EVs, but it's still a small percentage. So, I see vehicles are still highly important to us now and for the next many years. The good news there is that as we continue to have good penetration in auto we continue to increase the amount of content that we have in vehicles. You might have seen the comment that we've grown more than 11% annual growth rate in the amount of kilograms per vehicle. Now, about two-thirds of that actually comes from our M&A and that's why we did the M&A to acquire nylon and TPE to have that opportunity to penetrate more on vehicles about one-third from our kind of legacy materials. Obviously, volume is a metric. We're also very important on what is the value of the materials we're putting in vehicles, because we want to be contributing high value, high margin; obviously polymers into vehicles. So we're looking at both. But again, all of the trends light-weighting, avoidance of paints, because of emissions, our order, our durability, replacement of other plastics for functionality, these are all important trends both in ICE and EV. John Roberts : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: A question on Acetyls. Looks like you pushed more acid into China, and then in Western world you diverted more volumes to VAM and emulsions. Is that a strategy sort of going forward? You had a similar strategy last quarter. And what is the future of Singapore plant? You talked about rationalization in Asia. So what's the future of Singapore plant, especially in light of the new capacity announced by BP? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So thanks P.J. So, really our strategy in Acetyls is to follow the money. So, if you look at second quarter, we actually pulled volume out of China into the Western Hemisphere where you see acid pricing was better. We pulled it into VAM, another derivatives where pricing was better. As Todd referred to earlier, we've actually seen an increase in pricing in Asia, especially here at the end of the quarter. And demand for volumes, we actually moved more volume back into China, move volume out of Europe where we saw a real softening in the third quarter, and as we started to see softening in the Americas, move volume out as well. So, we're really -- that is our business model, which is to have the flexibility and capability to move our molecules around between regions and between acetic acid and derivatives in order to maximize our returns, and that's how we deliver pretty stable Acetyl Chain returns. As far as Singapore, I mean we're still working through that. Obviously, with the announced expansion in Clear Lake, we\u2019ve said we'll take capacity out of Asia. We are still looking to see how everything develops in terms of pricing in China, pricing in Singapore. Obviously IMO 2020 and the impacts on pricing for fuel oil could have an impact around that decision. So, we are still preserving our options in both cases until we see where the economics lead us. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. And a question for Scott. Scott, you did a $275 million buyback. You're on pace to buy $1 billion worth of stock. It looks like the pecking acquisitions aren't quite there. So, can you give us an update on the overall M&A strategy? There is some talk about strategic splits or an R&D transaction. So, can you talk about that, and generally sort of the ongoing consolidation in the industry? Thank you. Scott Richardson : Yeah. Let me hit the buyback question first P.J., and then I'll let Lori comment broadly on M&A. So, we did $275 million in the quarter. That was at an average price around $113. We did -- we've done $775 million for the year at an average price between $105 and $106. That's kind of where we sit when we finished the quarter. We expect to finish at $1 billion as I said earlier. We're going to be opportunistic with that cash flow. We are increasing CapEx. Organic investment is our priority for extra cash and we're taking CapEx up. We're going to finish around $400 million this year. We'll take that up to $500 million next year, possibly even a little more than that as we have attractive projects. And that's always going to be our first choice. Then we look at bolt-on M&A. In this environment, we have not seen people really being overly willing to sell in a more depressed economic environment. And so we've repurposed that cash towards buybacks, and we'll continue to do that opportunistically. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. And a transformational M&A, I mean I know there's been a lot in the press and many of you have written about it and taken certain positions. I think correctly many of you said you weren't surprised by discussion of transformational M&A. And I think we've been very clear here, and Mark before me about we will continue to pursue whatever form of M&A is the most value added to the shareholder. Look, we regularly use advisers to help us evaluate options. It's an ongoing activity to -- for us. That hasn't changed. And quite frankly, there's really no change in our philosophy around whether or not it's attractive to split the company. If, at some point in time it becomes attractive to do a split, because we've done other activities, we would consider doing that. But it is still our opinion that to split the company as it is today, really wouldn't add value to the shareholder because of the dissynergies associated with the split, and what we see as not much value uplift just from having a split short of some sort of other transformational activity. P.J. Juvekar: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning. Just want to dig in a little deeper. You called out disappointing joint ventures in the EM segment. Can you kind of walk through Saudi and Korea and Japan? And what are you seeing there that's disappointing? Is it structural? Is it just macro? Maybe kind of tease some of that out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I -- look I think the -- let me start with Saudi with our Ibn Sina joint venture. We had indicated last quarter that we expected about a $10 million uplift from Ibn Sina this quarter versus second quarter coming out of the turnaround in Ibn Sina.  We actually only got about $4 million, so a couple of things there. One is, we have a little bit of residual turnaround expense that still hit the books in third quarter. And the other thing is, we had a GAAP tax rate adjustment that we booked this quarter. So we didn't get everything we wanted out of Ibn Sina this quarter. Also if we move to the POM joint ventures, what I would say is, as we really work to move POM and as we've seen challenges in POM pricing with the downturn in autos our joint ventures have suffered as well, and maybe even more so than our own volumes. So we've not seen the returns from those joint ventures that we enjoyed for example say in 2018. But I would say, it's generally reflective of general market conditions for the products that they make and the regions that they make them more so than anything specifically around the operations of the joint venture. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then in tow with the shutdown of the Mexican plant happening this quarter, what's the impact of that on earnings? And then what should we see when we come out of that from kind of increased earnings on the backside? And when will that hit? Will that hit squarely in Q1? Or will we have to wait a little bit for that to flow through? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So Ocotl\u00e1n will shut down at the end of this month as we had discussed earlier. There was about $100 million to $110 million of costs that came with that shutdown, $10 million for personnel and another $95 million of non-cash items. So, really accelerated depreciation and impairment, so we'll see those hit this year. That shutdown and the savings that come with it going forward make up a significant portion of the $50 million of productivity we needed to see to maintain flat earnings in Acetate Tow going forward. So what I would say is, given that and the market dynamics, I would expect Acetate Tow going forward, so next year to look very similar to what it did this year because these savings are already baked into that. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey guys. Good morning. I guess first off back to the 2020 guidance, Lori. How would you have us think about quarterly phasing as we think about 2020? And related to that, how are we thinking about volumes at the low end of guidance? How would that shake out by the two core segments EM and AC? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So in -- look I wouldn't -- we haven't really looked at it by quarter. So I would assume quarterly volumes tend to follow what has been -- had been our historical patterns for quarterly earnings. I wouldn't think that's much different. We see some fourth quarter seasonality. We usually see some down in the first quarter for China. I mean, I will just look to the past really for how the quarters tend to the bake out. We don't see that being very different this year. I mean obviously we start to -- we see these full year impacts of some of the expansion projects, we've done so that has some volume uptick in the Acetyl Chain. But we should also start seeing some volume impacts as well as some productivity impacts from some of the new projects we've done in EM, so the new compounding lines that we've just completed in Nanjing and Suzhou. So I would -- typically we see increases in EM of kind of mid to high single digits; acetate a little bit lower than that, a couple of percent. I wouldn't say that a lot different next year. A lot of what we're seeing in terms of what's baked into the 2020 outlook is, just similar markets to this year, the absence of Clear Lake and really productivity and cash deployment, so the things within our control. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. And then in terms of the destocking comments you made specific to EM and Europe, do you see that sort of phasing through as we enter 4Q? Or do you think -- still think that there is going to be some residual destocking with -- specific to autos for fourth quarter in EM? Thanks so much. Lori Ryerkerk : No. Look, I really think if we look at fourth quarter, what we're seeing is pretty typical of the seasonality we see. I mean China as an example, if we look at our order books in October versus July, China is up about 2%. That's pretty typical that we see China come up in the fourth quarter and have good demand in advance of Chinese New Years in the first quarter. On the other hand, the U.S. and Europe are flat to slightly down across the sectors which again is also fairly typical from a seasonal basis. So I don't really see a lot more destocking occurring. Like we said, we saw it really in Europe as a result of the really severe decline in auto in the last quarter. But we really -- every other signal is that we're really -- we've really seen the destocking occur in all of the other sectors. And so we don't expect destocking to occur in fourth quarter. But again, we will see some lower volume outside of China, associated with just seasonality, both in Acetyls and EM. Ghansham Panjabi : Yeah, understood. Thanks so much, Lori. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Could you flesh out a little bit more detail, what you're thinking about the longer-term optionality for Acetate Tow? Or what -- to what degrees freedom there are more limited than you might it thought initially? And secondly, can you update your thinking about opportunities to pull forward productivity and working capital efficiency gains in 2020, 2021? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So look, I mean Acetate Tow, I think, we feel confident going into 2020 of our ability to maintain relatively flat earnings. We do see pressure on volumes, as we've seen quite frankly that slowing down a little bit especially in China, where in fact China recently we've actually seen growth in cigarette demand. So, we do expect continuing volume and price declines in Acetate Tow. But with the Ocotl\u00e1n, exposure with other productivity we still see and expect that to be able to maintain flat, certainly through 2020. Scott Richardson : Yeah. And then on productivity and working capital Laurence, I think, a lot of the investments that we're making, as we increase organic investment. A lot of those are tied to revenue generation. But it's also tied to productivity and working capital. So for example, we've talked about the need to invest more in Engineered Materials, in Asia. That improves our supply chain. It also lowers our overall inventory level. So a lot of this is very consistent with the investments that we're making. We've aggressively been working capital now for a while. You've seen that reflected in the improvement of free cash flow. Productivity is -- we've seen an uptick in productivity this year. We expect that cost reduction productivity to continue into 2020. Because we're really focused on what we can control, what are the controllable actions that are unique to Celanese that are going to drive the earnings growth from 2019 and 2020, because as we said earlier, we're just not expecting fundamental improvements in our end markets. Laurence Alexander : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. You've indicated about a $500 million capital expenditure budget for 2020. I guess two parts, can you talk through how much of that is growth versus cost-reduction projects and maintenance? And then more broadly, that's about double what the company was spending from 2014, through 2017. Should we think of $500 million as a new normal level for the company? Or would you expect that level to come back down in the out-years as you complete your expansions in Texas for example? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah, so it is about double. Let me characterize it for you, so, if we -- if I look at historically, where we spent, we spend roughly $200 million a year for EHS and what I call, maintain-margin projects. So, reliability, relighting of equipment things we need to do just to keep the current assets running and running consistent with good safety standards and environmental compliance. So that's $200 million a year. We spend another $200 million a year like this year, $200 million a year in productivity and revenue-generation projects. So things like that Clear Lake expansion. Things like improving energy efficiency at boilers. Things that give us a high-quality greater than 20% return. As we go up to $500 million all of that growth is really in productivity and rev gen. So it's the Clear Lake expansion project. If we -- so I would just say $200 million is kind of our base level run and maintain capital. And then everything you see above $200 million is really towards productivity and revenue generation. Just to put it on that perspective, our return on our total portfolio, including kind of those non-return base projects is greater than 20%. So we still have great opportunity to invest in ourselves and value-added projects that will be a great return for the shareholder. If I go past 2020, so 2020, $500 million, if we go into 2021, 2023 we actually may see levels above $500 million as we look at our Chinese localization projects, building additional EM capacity in China, other productivity and rev gen products around the globe. But I would say kind of post that period of growth that we've outlined, we would return to the approximately less -- the less than $400 million level of ongoing capital. Kevin McCarthy : Great, that's very helpful. And secondly, if I may, I want to ask you to just talk through the outages in a little bit more detail. I saw in your management remarks last night that you had brought Singapore down for maintenance, I think just prior to the incident at Clear Lake. Did you have other outages? And what's your latest thinking on when the CO unit might restart at Clear Lake? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So let me address Singapore first. So, Singapore was a planned turnaround. The timing for the Singapore turnaround and the duration of the Singapore turnaround is tied to our CO producer's turnaround in Singapore. So, we only have one source of CO in Singapore, and they had to take that unit on turnaround on a planned basis. And that really accounts for the duration of the outage in Singapore. So, I would put that into the kind of normal operational bucket of events. Clearly, Clear Lake was an unplanned downtime. We've been working through the impacts of that outage. As of today, methanol is back at full rates, acid has restarted and really at partial rate \u2013 and we'll be a partial rate until we get the CO plan up, VAM we'll be up before the end of the week. And we continue on our CO repairs, which will put us back at full rates some time within the fourth quarter. Kevin McCarthy : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning. David Begleiter : Lori, going back to BP's one million ton JV announcement, what do think they're seeing in China that you're not as you rationalize some of your capacity in that region? Lori Ryerkerk : So I'll ask Todd to comment, but as we've looked at that I don't know that they're seeing anything we're not. What we do know is they have the demand for that much acetic acid in their own derivatives system. And apparently, as we have done with methanol and others they have decided that being more integrated along their value chain will give them greater value. So, we wouldn't actually expect any of that acetic acid just show up on the market. We expect that to be consumed in their own derivatives, again based on our view. But Todd may have more color on that. Todd Elliott : Yeah, Dave, it's Todd. We're just studying the news and trying to understand it better. And this is at least as far as we can tell an MOU announcement at this point. So it's early days in the project. It will take some time to work through the details, I'm sure and all the work that we follow in terms of engineering ultimately time line of projects. As I said before, we're pleased that we're on track with our expansion in Clear Lake by 2022. So, we'll \u2013 we think we'll be first with this capability. I think Lori is right. I think this is largely an integration move upstream PX down through PTA and ultimately a polyester to service of the Chinese localized demand for polyester in the region. So, we think it's largely an integrated announcement. It will have little effect on a merchant market. David Begleiter : Got it. And just lastly on Acetate Tow, any potential for a price increase given perhaps higher supply/demand post the closing of your Mexico facility? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So, we do believe in time as we rationalize others rationalizing the industry that there will be potential for a price increase. I mean, quite frankly, what we see is for more transactional of short-term contracts. We have been able to push through price increases for some of our longer-term contracts. We've seen price decline. So it's about in balance at the moment, but we certainly project going forward all the \u2013 continue to be tension around price, we actually think the price environment will be fairly stable and at some point in the future some opportunity to push price up. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the portfolio questions. In the past I guess you had noted that the dissynergies have kind of come down to around $50 million a year from your prior estimate of $100 million. Have you continued to make progress on bringing those down? And if so how would you characterize that now at this point? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So, look we continue to always look at how we can do this, but there is a certain amount of dissynergies, which is always going to exist, if you're splitting into two companies. You have to have standup two management teams. You have to have two back offices. I mean, there is always going to be a certain amount of dissynergies associated with that. So, maybe let me ask Scott, if he has any more specific comments. Scott Richardson : Yeah. I mean, you're right. With that, trajectory of statements that we've made in the past $100 million down to $50 million we continue to work it, work on the tax side of things leakage et cetera. So we have brought it down below $50 million, but I would say its closer to $50 million than it is to zero. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. And just kind of understanding, when you think about China what's it going to take for \u2013 what are some of the markers you're looking for to see that there is an improvement in primary demand or at least the stabilization? Would it be inventory levels or anything else that we should be watching? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. Look, I think as much as anything we look at price volatility. I mean, we're anxious to get whether past this national holiday to see, if demand returns prior to Chinese New Years. Obviously, the same factors affecting the rest of the globe concerns about tariffs concerns about global recession. These also impact China. But we're just looking for the signs of sustainable \u2013 kind of sustainable demand lift to occur. I mean, again we saw an increase in Asia in the third quarter in volumes and price. It seems, it's not greatly improving at the moment, but it's also not greatly declining. So we see that as somewhat favorable. But we need some sustainability in the response which is probably what we haven't seen yet. Todd, anything you want to add? Todd Elliott : No, I think that's right. In acetyls we -- just like Lori said, we look at order books on a daily, weekly basis. Supply/demand, utilization trends are critical as it affects the pricing environment, raw materials of course be it methanol or olefins, MTO rates. Your point on inventory levels, I'm sure that's the same across the whole of the company both finished good inventories on a customer side particularly. I mean so all those classical markers those fundamentals are what track and watch all the time. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. The prepared comments mentioned Nanjing was running at lower rates due to a request from local authorities. Was this around air quality? And would you expect it to persist in the fourth quarter and 2020 as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. No, you're exactly right Matthew. So what we had and what all of the industry had was a request by the Chinese government to reduce rates for air quality purposes in advance of the national holiday. Since then they -- when we went back and asked to have that lifted they were willing to do so I think reflecting on our long relationship with them and their understanding of our business need. Since then I think that's mostly been lifted through most of industry in the fourth quarter. So look I expect it's going to continue from time to time in China. I would expect maybe it will happen again right before the Chinese New Years. That tends to be a pattern. So I think it will happen again. Right now, we're not seeing that being an impact on fourth quarter. Todd Elliott : And the good news is we were able to ramp rates back up as needed following the Clear Lake incident. So we worked with the team there and certainly with the local government and we're allowed to run at full rates as we expected. And that was helpful to cover the -- from a network perspective the loss of the Clear Lake capacity. The only other thing to watch maybe late in the year is the winter season heating season. I mean typically depending on the energy profile and sources for energy production and as well as industrial activity there can be curtailment activity towards the kind of late November, December time frame depending on various conditions. So we'll watch that. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. Thanks. And then your EM project wins last year rose about 47%. You're on a similar pace this year, but EM volumes are down about 5% this year. Could you just help me reconcile those two numbers? I mean I guess that implies your base business has seen some pretty significant volume declines. Is there anything changing in terms of the size of the profitability of the average project? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So look I would say the size of the average project, if you talk about volume is less than it was. And it reflects the fact that we're doing more projects and more different types of projects. I think it's also important to realize that look some -- these projects come in through buckets. I mean, you have some that are very long-term-return projects. So for example in the medical field and some of the auto some of these are projects that continue to pay out for 5-plus years. And then you probably have another bucket that maybe you get one year from that or maybe two years and then you have a number of them that are actually very transactional. So it's a project that moves volume, but it's a onetime move. So not all of these projects are things that pay out for five years. And so what you see is while we can have up to 15% growth from EM projects in a year's time frame, it could very well be that only 5% or something of those continue. And then of course you have attrition normally from other projects rolling off as well as just other attrition. So I mean project wins is an important metric for us, because it's just as how good are we generating materials. But they are smaller this year because of the economic conditions and we are seeing kind of more attrition in the base with lower GDP and lower demand around the world. So that all comes into play, but we still think it's important, because this is what's allowing us to show the sequential quarter-on-quarter growth that we've shown in the last quarter. It's continuing to deliver these projects. And as we referenced in our notes, we had a lot of great project wins this quarter. Now not all that volume doesn't show up this quarter. It shows up -- many of those were long term with the medical project wins. We had some auto project wins. A lot of -- we have some 5G product wins. A lot of those will show up over the next two to five years not necessarily next quarter. Matthew Blair : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question. Jim Sheehan : Good morning, thank you. How should we think about plant turnaround costs in 2020 versus 2019? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, great question. So turnaround in 2020 we actually see -- expect to be up about $50 million. Overall, we have a number of big turnarounds next year including our joint venture methanol plant in Clear Lake some of our POM units. So these are big units that only come up for turnaround every three to four years. So we do have a significant turnaround workload next year. But that's baked into our numbers. The additional productivity that we're delivering will help offset that and that's already anticipated in the 2020 outlook that I gave you. Jim Sheehan : Thanks. And regarding the General Motors labor union strike, how are you thinking about automotive shutdowns and whether the impact this year will be normal or above normal? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So for the GM specifically that's not a big customer of ours. So, we didn't have a lot of exposure to GM, so we haven't seen much impact from that. Clearly there are other autos that would have had a bigger impact. I don't know that we've seen that as a major impact going forward for us. I mean, we tend to be spread across quite a lot. Obviously we have a lot of auto in Europe that maybe a bigger exposure. China as we said auto actually have picked up recently. Now, I expect some consolidation of auto in China, but again I think we're well positioned for that. Jim Sheehan : Thank you. Chuck Kyrish : Christine, we\u2019ll make the next question, our last question. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew DeYoe : Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you just walk a little bit through the buckets on the productivity gains of $0.50 then? Because if I recall from Duffy's question, you had mentioned part of that savings is going to go the savings from the closure in Mexico and then you just mentioned part of that will go to offsetting the maintenance expense next year, which is already looking to maybe be offset by the $45 million in losses you're taking this year on Clear Lake. So where those $0.50 bucketing out? And then does that mean the net gains from productivity are less than $0.50? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So well no, no. I'd say well, no, the net gains -- this is net gain is $0.50. So this actually because of turnarounds and everything else, obviously, requires a much higher level of productivity than that. So this is net what we get of plus turnaround plus productivity et cetera, et cetera. So where does it come from? So Ocotl\u00e1n, as well as Lebanon, as well as other shutdowns that we've had and footprint management reduction that goes into the productivity bucket. There's the bucket in there, which is we work very hard on energy and cost savings. In energy like I said boiler configuration things to help lower energy usage that goes into productivity. There's also raw material contracts and things we've done to buy forward or do things with raws to manage our raw material cost versus the spot market. That -- those for example are going to productivity. So I'd say those are the major buckets as well as just normal optimization and maintenance spend, optimization of personnel. We've done a lot, which you've seen show up in terms of rightsizing our organization and reorganizing for the most productive organization. You've seen some of the severance costs associated with that. So those are all buckets within productivity. Scott, do you have any other perspective on that? Scott Richardson : No, I think that is it. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. And then so my last one I guess. Price was down about 2% sequentially and year-over-year in EM. I think you'd mentioned P-O-M, POM as being one part of weakness. But what are the other primary markets responsible for the softness? Is this competition or deflation in raws? And then on the latter comment where are you seeing the primary savings in EM as your spread to raws has improved? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. A good bit of it I would say is mix. I mean in general we've been able to hold our price in a declining raw material market. So that has helped us. But there in a few of our materials we've seen some mix impacts for example less medical, more leads or less leads, more general GUR. I mean so there's a few areas where that's happened but I'd say it's more the mix this year because in general we've been able to hold pricing despite a decline in raw materials across EM. Matthew DeYoe : And then I guess was organic volume growth in EM, what would you say -- or I guess what the better question is how much did acquisitions contribute to EM volume growth on the quarter? Is that about 2% or something? Lori Ryerkerk : No. So volume growth on EM was up about 3%. I would say most -- all of that is organic. There wasn't a notable difference in terms of acquisition growth. Matthew DeYoe : I was thinking year-over-year sorry. Lori Ryerkerk : And that's all the acquisitions or the acquisitions, which happened a while ago so. Matthew DeYoe : Yeah. I was just thinking year-over-year, but I can square that. Thank you. Operator : Mr. Kyrish, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Christine. I would like to thank everybody for listening in today and thank you to those who participated. As usual we're around after the call for other questions. And Christine you can close the call out after that. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Celanese Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you, Donna. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chuck Kyrish, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today are Lori Ryerkerk, Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer; and Todd Elliott, Senior Vice President, Acetyl Chain. Celanese Corporation distributed its fourth quarter earnings release via BusinessWire and posted prepared remarks about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday after market close. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures also on our website.  Today's presentation will include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as the prepared comments document. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open the line directly to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Lori, if you could just clarify on the outlook for EM for 2020, the 10% EBIT growth. There was a lot of commentary in your comments about your differentiated volume performance from the innovation. And I just wanted to get a sense of how much volume growth you are expecting in the year? And how much of that will contribute to organic growth towards the 10% target versus the self-help measures that you also discussed? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks for your question, Vincent. So maybe just to clarify, what we're saying for EM for next year is we are saying 10% EBIT growth, but there will be an offset to that because of the -- some offset to that because of the turnaround load next year in EM, specifically the Bishop POM turnaround. So that 10% EBIT growth really comes from a couple of items : one, we do believe we're at the end of destocking, so we're seeing more normalized order rates; we are also seeing the benefits of the project wins, those from 2019 and moving into the wins for 2020. So project wins from our existing customers, but also new project wins, as we called out in the script from things like electric vehicles and 5G. Further on the 10% EBIT, we'll see some help from raw materials and specifically, really, the raw materials help that occurred in '19, but we didn't see in '19 because of the length of our supply chain and inventory. So we should start to see some help from raw materials as we move forward. And then, of course, additional productivity, which is going to occur in EM that has occurred. For example, Lebanon shutdown, which happened last year, are in 2019. And then this year, we've already announced the shutdown of our compounding facilities in Shelby, which will have [indiscernible] some help in 2020. And in addition, we have the help from some of our new capacity that's come on. For example, the 4 lines we've started up in China in the second half of last year, which will help with our supply chain cost and being close to our customers in China. Vincent Andrews : And as a follow-up, if I could just ask you, you mentioned in relation to the Clear Lake shutdown in the fourth quarter that acetic prices didn't respond to that. But you also noted that you were able to not see a volume decline. So I sort of see a tension between those 2 things, and I'm just wondering if -- how you weighted continuing to ship volume versus maybe letting the market tighten up a little bit and seeing improved margins? And just how you thought about that in terms of the overall profitability of the segment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it's the whole thing. So I mean, really good work by the acetyl team to offset the impacts of the Clear Lake outage in the fourth quarter. A little counterintuitively, because we had lower pricing, we didn't see as much impact from the shutdown in Clear Lake. You have to remember also, most of our volume goes from the U.S. towards Asia, so we actually weren't shipping as much that way. So that's actually a bit of a help, although it cost more to produce in China, obviously. So when you put that all together, what we saw is, with the shift downstream to derivatives, moving more into VAM and emulsions, keeping what volume we did have in the Western Hemisphere where the pricing was somewhat better, we were really able to offset the impact of Clear Lake. But we did see it in the pricing. But there, again, the team was also able to offset nearly 50% of the pricing impact on the year, again, due to the move to the Western Hemisphere and due to the moves with derivatization into emulsions, into VAM and VAE. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Roberts of UBS. John Roberts : Do you have a special strategy review underway, as was speculated in the press? Or do you just have your normal ongoing strategy activities? Lori Ryerkerk : So we've actually gone through a big strategy exercise in the second half of 2019. This is really as it relates to our core businesses. So what we're going to do in the Acetyl Chain, you saw some of that in the emulsions announcement that came out. Obviously, the Elotex acquisition is part of that strategy as well to strengthen and further extend our Acetyl Chain. It is in Engineered Materials, where you saw some of our comments around a move towards Asia localization, for example, which is about getting closer to our customers and shortening our supply chain with our customers. In Acetate Tow, it is about looking for next-generation uses of cellulose acetate as we see the decline in the tow industry and being able to move flake into other applications. All of those are outcomes of that strategy review, which we undertook in the second half of '19. So we will be continuing to review that with our Board here in the first half of the year, and anticipate an Investor Day sometime midyear, where we'll be able to share that strategy with you all in more detail. Obviously, that strategy anticipates some bolt-on M&A. Again, you saw that with Elotex. I will also tell you though that strategy is very focused on self-help, organic investment, organic use of cash to grow our own networks and our own capability short of anything that can happen with M&A. John Roberts : And then secondly, in engineering plastics, how much did lower raw materials help the earnings on either a sequential or year-over-year basis? Lori Ryerkerk : So really, raw materials, '18 to '19, we didn't see much help in 2019. We expect to see more of that help rolling to 2020. And that just reflects the long nature of the supply chain in Engineered Materials, where it has to be polymerized, then it has to be compounded, then it has to be moved to the customer. So that is a fairly long supply chain. So we actually expect that help to show up more in 2020. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : If you had to compare your net turnaround costs in 2020 with your net turnaround costs in 2019, what would be the 2020 benefit? Or what's the difference as best as you can tell? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So the impact from turnarounds in 2020 is a total of $70 million to $80 million, and that's $50 million more than we had in 2019. So it will be -- it's a hurt in 2020 of $50 million, which we will offset through additional productivity and other actions. And -- but that's fully baked into our plan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : So in your materials, you talk about an aspiration of $11 a share in earnings. To reach $11 a share, you've got to grow your EBITDA by, I don't know, $140 million. Given the current business conditions, if you had to size that $140 million to reach your aspirations, where would it come from? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So let me kind of do that walk. So if we look at that $11 that we've put out there as the challenge we put to the organization, if we start -- I'm just going to do it on earnings per share, because it's easier. If we start with the $9.53, we will see an uplift next year of, just call it, $0.15 to $0.20 because we won't have the Clear Lake incident impact. So that gets us right to the $9.70 range. We add another $0.50 due to share buybacks and cash and other forms of cash deployment, and so that's another $0.50 that gets you to $10.20. We have put in $0.50 of net productivity, so that's also offsetting $0.35 of turnaround. So to put it in perspective, that's about $125 million of net productivity, which we have to achieve to do that. We're targeting between $200 million and $250 million of gross productivity, so we can offset price increases, energy variations, et cetera, et cetera. But -- so we think that's very achievable, consistent with what we've been able to do in the past. So it's $0.50 of gross -- of net productivity gets us to $10.70. And then we need about $0.30 more of improvement, I will say, in demand. I mean, really, we lost about $0.30 just in fourth quarter of this year. And that was really due to the stronger-than-expected seasonality in Engineered Materials, as well as a really dramatic price drop-off that we saw in acetyl really in December. Both of those occurred in December. So if we just return to kind of the first 3 quarter level of demand and pricing in our businesses, we will recover that $0.30. So that's how we get to the $11. Obviously, we're not going to wait for the market to give that back to us, so we're also trying to identify is there other steps or other productivity measures that we can take to also recover that $0.30 and make sure we get to $11. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Robert Koort : Lori, in the prepared remarks, you talked about operating rates in acetic, I guess, declining 7% globally last year. Can you give us some sense regionally how that looks? And then what your expectations are in 2020? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So if we look at, really, utilization for the industry. Full year, year-on-year, '18 to '19, we saw almost a 10% drop in China utilization. Now globally, that was just over 5%, and so most of that was coming from China, and most of that in '18 to '19 was coming from demand. Interestingly, in the fourth quarter, we saw that similar kind of 10% drop, just third quarter to fourth quarter in China, and that was really due to less outages. It wasn't a drop in demand, third quarter to fourth quarter. It was because there were less outages in China in fourth quarter. And that really put us in an oversupply situation, which, again, we also then saw reflected in pricing. Globally, fourth quarter was a little under 10%, again, mostly driven by China, a little bit driven in demand in other parts of the globe. Robert Koort : And I guess, in the past, maybe to your last Investor Day, you guys had talked about expecting some more takeout in the industry, some more capacity reduction. How has that path been relative to your expectations? And is there some left that you think might come out of the market in acetic? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it's a great question, and one, frankly, we think about it a lot. I mean, obviously, if you look at the amount of supply that was in the market in the fourth quarter, you'd have to say, not much capacity has come out in China. However, we believe China remains committed to their environmental targets. And so we still expect some to occur in the future. But we're just not -- we just didn't see that much through 2019. Todd, do you have any additional comments? Todd Elliott : Yes. Bob, it's Todd Elliott, I would add that, that utilization drop over the course of the year, about 7%, that is, to Lori's point, a combination of some demand over the course of the year. More availability throughout the year relative to '18, certainly. But we think the fundamentals are there. If we -- to the point also on EM, similar to asset deals, if we get a kind of normalization of demand patterns as we go into the new year 2020, we think that, that utilization rate will come right back into that mid-80 range on a global basis. So we already saw improvement in pricing to start 2020 in the first quarter off of December levels that already started to move up. We need to see that through over the course of Q1, given the conditions in front of us there. But one other point that I think is important to mention. While acetic acid remains a key product for us, very, very significant in terms of our position, we're growing our derivatives as well. And you think about our volume profile year-to-year. We were down about 15% on acetic acid volumes in '19 versus '18, but we didn't stop at that point. We actually took about 6% more of our acetic acid and moved that downstream to VAM and to emulsions.  When you look at the volume profile of VAM and emulsions, they were actually up 8%, '19 to '18. So we have actually intentionally moved our mix regionally, Western Hemisphere as well -- Western Hemisphere-focus as well, and that will allow us to add some resiliency and actually create some more diversity. And then the step we just announced yesterday with Elotex' acquisition as another leg on that chain -- or another link on that chain, which will allow us to take our emulsions business into now the powders product line and provide more resiliency as well going forward. Robert Koort : Got it. Yes, that's laudable. And I also want to thank you, guys. The continued way you present your earnings is very efficient and appreciated, and we're hopeful maybe your peers will start doing the same thing. Operator : Our next question is coming from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Patrick Fischer : Maybe another way to hit the acetic acid. In the last 4 or 5 months, there have been 2 very large announcements for new capacity. So you had ZPCC plus BP and then Reliance. Now I know we've had a lot of announcements over the last decade that haven't come to fruition. If you were handicapping these 2 kind of helping us with our supply model going forward, how likely are these? And kind of in what time frame should we expect them to come up, do you think? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, look, Duffy, if I would tip the current economics around acetyl, I think it doesn't support new investment. So we really have to consider what other motivations these companies would have to build out acetic acid capacity, and I'll ask Todd to comment on that. But I would also say, from experience, any new capacity being announced now, it's probably a 3- to 5-year period to design, construct, get permits, et cetera, depending on the location. But I'd say it's 3 to 5 years before we would actually be able to see any of that capacity to come online. Todd, do you have anything to add? Todd Elliott : Yes, Duffy, I think that's right. On the first one you mentioned, we were asked that question last quarter and continue to see that as an integration step associated with the change to polyester. So it's in our view, it's just an integration move and it's probably multiple years down the road. Patrick Fischer : Okay. And then a question around Ibn Sina. So after the expansion there : one, how has Ibn Sina run in the interim? And then two, do you see any change in the ownership structure with Aramco's investment in SABIC? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So Ibn Sina, of course, had a big turnaround this year, that hit our earnings this year by about $30 million. That's a normal turnaround. I think operationally, we're happy with the Ibn Sina operation. So far, we've seen no real impact from the acquisition of SABIC, the ownership change to Saudi Aramco. I don't anticipate that will really change anything, and we certainly haven't seen anything yet. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : If I take a look at adjusted EBIT for the Acetyl Chain in the fourth quarter and even add back Clear Lake and annualize it, it's a little -- it's below the $750 million to $800 million that you talked about in your prepared remarks in terms of your earnings level that you think is sustainable. So I guess, is that kind of the outlook for 2020 to be in that range? And then, if so, how do we sort of improve from fourth quarter levels? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So if you look at just fourth quarter, Mike, I mean, 2 factors. Clear -- so Clear Lake, $20 million, and then typical seasonality in acetyl is $20 million to $30 million. So I think if you add those back in, you pretty quickly get us back to that $750 million to $800 million foundational level that we believe we're at in acetyl. Michael Sison : Okay, great. And then I think earlier, maybe in the fourth quarter, given where your stock was, the thought was that the portfolio made most sense to stay together. We're a little bit far from that level, unfortunately, now. So any thoughts there and what you think you need to do to get a sustainable appreciation for the portfolio that you have? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I agree. We still think it makes sense to keep it together at this point, because of some of the dis-synergies associated with splitting it. I think we see the whole market down right now, so it's kind of hard to say where we'll end up if we see some turnaround as we go. We're actually quite excited and optimistic about 2020. We think we have a good path laid out in front of us. We think we'll be able to continue to show the potential earnings capability and high multiple capability of this business as we move through 2020. We're also really excited about our strategy for the next 6 years and the earnings growth potential associated with that strategy. Again, based on things under our control, which is organic CapEx investment and productivity. So we think this continues to be a really high return business. We think, as we move into 2020, that will be more recognized by the market. And just ask you guys to kind of watch this space. Operator : Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. P.J. Juvekar: One of your competitors called out nylon pricing as quite weak. Can you talk about your nylon business? What you're seeing there in terms of price and volume? And how much of your EM business is more base polymer like nylon versus how much is sort of specialty? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, good question, P.J. If you might recall back, I think it's the second quarter earnings, we actually did call out softness in nylon pricing and demand back then. And possibly, we see it sooner because we don't polymerize. We buy polymer and we compound nylon. So we were seeing the softness back in midyear. Frankly, through the second half of the year, it's been where we expected it to be. And so that may be the difference between us and our competitors. I would say, again, if you look at our EM business, 1/3 of it is really highly differentiated, kind of we're uniquely spec-ed in; 1/3 is differentiated, where maybe we're spec-ed in with someone else, but still differentiated; and then the third is, maybe more towards commodity or MTO-type products. I think that's the best way to characterize our EM business. And we constantly work to minimize that last bucket and move things into the more differentiated space, which specifically the nylon is what we've been doing [Technical Difficulty]. Operator : You may resume. Chuck Kyrish : Go ahead, Lori. Lori Ryerkerk : P.J., where did you lose us? P.J. Juvekar: I think you were talking about 1/3 unique, 1/3 differentiated and 1/3 commodity. Lori Ryerkerk : Right. And so look, and then what I was saying, specifically to our nylon, since that's our more recently acquired business and I think I talked about this also a little bit in the second quarter, what we found with that acquisition is they tended to have more commoditized nylon. And as we've gone through the last 1.5 years, we've been working to transition those to -- with using our project model to transition that to becoming more differentiated, so it will be more insulated to the market demand like we see kind of 2/3 of our portfolio. Todd Elliott : Yes, P.J., I think it's important, that last bucket Lori talked about. I mean, it's important that we play in that standard space because a lot of customers are buying a wide variety of different polymers and grades for various applications. And so having a presence in that part of the portfolio is very important to enable really that higher-margin part of the segment. P.J. Juvekar: Can you talk about the acetic acid cost curve? Because I think you take -- effectively take good advantage of that cost curve by moving downstream or moving products around the world. Can you just talk about your observations on the cost curve? Lori Ryerkerk : So there's a couple of different aspects of that, P.J. The first I would start with is, the vast majority of our acetic acid is produced in Clear Lake. And the reason for that is the cost advantage we have with natural gas pricing in the U.S. So I think that's the first piece. And clearly, that was a little bit of an impact with the Clear Lake downtime in fourth quarter. But we see that as an advantage, which continues well into the future and is the reason for our acetic acid reconfiguration project, which allows us to produce even more in the U.S., take advantage of that raw material as well as economy of scale productivity in lieu of making product somewhere else. And then as we've talked about before, our ability, which is unique, we think, in the industry, why we can go off-stream and make choices around how we acquire CO and methanol or make it ourselves, whatever is most economic, and then making choices about where to take value out of the chain, whether we move material into VAM and VAE or into emulsions, and now, another option to move into redispersible powder. We think that gives us a unique capability to manage a variety of economic conditions and make choices about where to take value out of the chain. That and the fact that we're globally located. We can choose where to sell for any of the range of our products, whether it be Asia or Western Hemisphere, and take advantage of those. And we've seen it -- we saw it in '18, where it made sense to move a lot of acid into China because of pricing. This year, we see the opposite, where we've moved significant volumes, Todd mentioned them, into VAM, VAE and emulsions and into the Western Hemisphere to take advantage of better pricing. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Lori, can you just talk about, within EM, how much of the business is auto related? And how much was that business down in Q4? And how much it was down in 2019? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. So about 1/3 of our EM business is tied to auto. And if you look at auto, auto was down about 6% globally in 2019 versus 2018. It's really all regions of the world. The U.S. is a little bit better. Unfortunately, 2 markets that we play very heavily in Germany and China were down closer to 8%. And then if you look at what that impact is on us, I mean, that's auto builds, but what we saw is with destocking at many of the molders and things in between us and the auto build, we actually saw double that amount of impact in terms of demand on materials going into auto. So we're really talking kind of a double-digit impact if we were based just on build. Now fortunately, we've also been continuously working to get the volume per vehicle up that we have. So since 2015, we've seen about 11% per year increase in the volume of materials we put into vehicles, part of that being M&A, but just 2% to 3% in the base volume. So that's offset some of that impact, but still clearly a significant impact this year. David Begleiter : And Todd, can you just comment on where acid profitability is in China today? Maybe where it was a year ago? And what your expectations are for it to go over the course of the year? Todd Elliott : Yes, I think we touched on it a bit. I mean, pricing did fall over the course of '19 versus '18, and probably, call it, about a 40% drop, '19 versus '18, so significant. And even during the fourth quarter, we saw it notch down each month to the low point in December. And that's why we intentionally pull product out of the region, moved it elsewhere, moved it downstream to derivatives, position that into different parts of the world, different applications to offset part of that development late in the year. Going into Q1, going into this fourth -- first quarter, we've already seen pricing up almost 10% in January. We think it's going to move over the course of the year. I mean, that's part of the ramp up to our $11. We're going to play a big role in that. We're ready to work hard on our network to move pricing over the course of the year. We've got to get through these two turnarounds -- or three, actually, in total. Methanol is down as we speak here in Q1, and we have both acetic acid and in Nanjing and in Clear Lake in Q2. By the way, those turnarounds are unusual in that there every four years in the case of methanol, and every three years in the case of acetic acid. So we're going to get those out of the way. We've got Clear Lake now back at full strength. And so we're -- we think we're well set up to move price over the course of the year once we get demand back to normal levels. David Begleiter : So Todd, on profitability, though, where profits -- where people are breakeven levels in, in Q4 in China? I saw a little bit more on profitability than pricing. Todd Elliott : Yes, I can't -- I can't answer exactly where everybody is there. I think it was a tough, tough end of the year for -- certainly for those producers in the space, given the combination of where methanol ended up, the MTO dynamics. I think it was a tough end of the year, but largely on soft demand, availability and just uncertainty. But I think that'll improve as we go forward. But our job is to maneuver within our network and position Celanese in the best way to take advantage of our network capabilities. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Matthew Krueger : This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. So sticking with the China theme. I just wanted to dig into what impact could coronavirus have on the acetic acid market in China? And how could this impact the global supply chain? Do you believe that any disruptions or related tightening would be a net positive or a net negative given the kind of demand, but also the capacity and pricing puts and takes there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, it's a great question. We don't know how long or what the impact is. Our first priority right now remains the health and safety of the over 800 people that we have in China. At this moment in time, we don't have any employees affected, and our operations continue as they were going into this. So at this point, we're not seeing an impact. I mean, clearly, if producers shut down, if this is extended, there could be a drop in demand, but there could also be a drop in supply. To that impact, specifically to Celanese, most of what we make in China stays in China. So we think that will be somewhat balanced for us. But quite frankly, it's just too early to call until we see how this further develops. Matthew Krueger : That's helpful. Understood. And then just wanted to touch on kind of the global growth in mosaic. So if global growth were to decelerate from current levels versus kind of inflect higher in the back half of the year, which seems to be what we're expecting, where does the sequential -- what primary levers do you have under your control that could maybe drive earnings stability or earnings improvement, even if global growth doesn't cooperate quite as much? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So just to clarify, our outlook for 2020 is really based on an economic environment similar to the first 3 quarters of 2019. So not increase in demand or increase in supply. And the real lever we have in front of us to -- in addition to working our business model, moving into derivatives, acetyls, the project model and EM, is productivity. I mean, the one thing I have to say is, the 9 months I've been here as CEO, I am just so impressed at the embedded productivity culture that exists in Celanese. I mean, it is not a once-a-year exercise. It is not even a once-a-quarter exercise. It is an everyday exercise for our folks to look for ways to reduce cost, improve raw materials, improve utilization. I mean, this is happening every single day. I mean, clearly, going into 2020, we realize we have a big uplift required. And so we have taken additional steps to try to identify other things that can happen. But just maybe a few examples. I mean, so we're constantly working on organizational efficiency. So revamping our supply chain and how we manage that and moving to a more digitized, modern system for supply chain is a way that we'll get credits this year and over the next several years. Increasing digitization of all of our operations, not just our manufacturing operations, but also the way we handle customer orders and every other aspect of our business. Really looking at our global and regional org structures to make sure that they're properly sized and configured to best support our businesses going forward. We also look always at our footprint. So you saw the announcement around shutting down compounding in Shelby. We shut down the Lebanon facility this past year. You're familiar with the Ocotl\u00e1n shutdown. I mean, these are all things constantly look at doing, which is how do we drive cost out? How do we improve efficiency? How do we improve utilization? Just a few examples. And I think this is something Celanese does extremely well, and I'm extremely proud to be a part of, which is continuously kind of keeping the future in our own hands rather than just being dependent on the market. Operator : Our next question is coming from Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : So just related to that. Two questions around sustainability. In your prepared remarks, you called out sort of the overall outperformance of EM against the underlying market. If conditions stay weak for several years, do you see the gap of outperformance being stable? Or do you think over time you would converge -- or you'd lose some of that excess outperformance? And secondly, on productivity, with the step-up that you're doing this year, how should we think about the ebb and flow, that is, if conditions improve, does the pace of productivity slow down? Or do you now see a line of sight to 3 to 5 years of $250 million of gross productivity because you've changed your approach or you found different angles that weren't previously gone after? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Laurence. Look, on the outperformance versus the market. This is built into how we do business. And I don't think that changes under varying market conditions. So again, I talked extensively already about the strength of our Acetyl Chain and how that differentiates us from our competitors because we have so much optionality around where to take value out of the chain and geographic optionality. That exists no matter if we're at high acetic acid prices or low, and I think sets us uniquely apart. And Engineered Materials, our project business model, which we've now overlaid with more of a program focus on emerging markets, things like EV, 5G, medical, we think that will allow us to continue to outperform. And again, based on my experience, I think our productivity measures far exceed -- and our consistency of productivity measures far exceed that of most of our competitors. So I think under any range of economic conditions, we will be able to continue to outperform the market and outperform our competitors. Todd Elliott : Yes, Laurence. I think 1 thing that's important is that the shape of that productivity changes over time depending on where we are in the market. And so if we get to a period of growth, our productivity tends to shift a little more towards revenue generation projects and debottlenecks, for example. So those are all things that the program of productivity that we operate here really is always looking at the things in the hopper and then matching which projects we accelerate depending on where we're at from a demand landscape perspective. Operator : Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : I wanted to ask you about two different derivatives. First, in VAM, I think 1 of your competitors declared force majeure about 3 weeks ago. I was wondering if you could talk about your near-term outlook for VAM. And then secondly, you announced intention to expand in VAE, 155-kiloton split between the Netherlands and China. I was wondering if you could just talk about what is driving that? Is VAE tight? And if so, why is that the case relative to other asset yield derivatives? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I'm going to ask Todd to comment. Maybe just a bit broader. So we actually see both of these as great opportunities for expansion. We see demand continuing to increase, and we think we have a favorable cost and technology position. And so in Clear Lake, in VAM, we actually have just completed a 150-kiloton expansion. We have another 150 kiloton over the next several years that we can do through small and low capital expansions in other locations. And then as you said, in VAE, we recently made the announcement about the expansions there, primarily in Nanjing and Geleen, but also some other areas. Again, we can do these in a very low capital way, which we think makes it very attractive for us and into the markets we're in. But let me hand it over to Todd, and he can add a bit more color. Todd Elliott : Yes. We're well positioned in that building space, think of self leveling, flooring, wall texturizing applications such as that external thermal insulation systems, both today and then going forward with our powders acquisition. So if you back up to the VAE news that we rolled out, the first wave of those are very targeted debottlenecks. So some capability enhancements that we'll bring into Geleen in the Netherlands as well as in Nanjing. Those are principally in reaction to customer pull. So we are fairly full, and so it's not a build way ahead and try to wait on demand. So these are really in response to customer needs, position us for the near term. And then following that, the next wave will be polymerization expansion in those 2 sites, looking out over the next several years. And that will dovetail nicely with the addition of the downstream step, which is the powder -- redispersible powder, largely built on VAE emulsions. So it's really a looking ahead. It's adding a derivative capability, be ready for customer demand, customer pull, and then we'll activate those operations in conjunction with customer needs over the next several years. Operator : Our next question is coming Matthew DeYoe, Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : Yes, just following up on that question. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the trajectory of methanol as it relates to VAM and acetic. What kind of decisions are you making to push more of your material down into VAM and acetic? I mean -- and what's your margin outlook, especially given weak methanol -- a weaker outlook for methanol? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I guess from a big picture overview, I would just say we don't really make decisions around investment based on kind of our outlook on short-term economics. I mean, what we have found in this business and what I continue to believe is true is having more optionality in the chain over a long period of time gives us the opportunity to optimize and stabilize our earnings out of the Acetyl Chain over the long term. So that's -- methanol is not really what's driving our decision for VAE and VAM investment. I think Todd described that. Todd, I don't know if you have any other comment? Todd Elliott : Yes. I mean, methanol is a key raw material. A strategic raw material. We made the investment a few years ago to produce, therefore improving the balance between make or buy, and that's how we think about it. I think it's interesting, when you look at our earnings profile last year, '19 versus even 2017, right? So we had $727 million of earnings this 2019. In 2017, with the exact same revenue, $3.4 billion of revenue, an almost identical tonnage, just over 5.2 million tons. We increased our earnings by over $150 million. Just think about that. From $575 million back in '17 to $727 million this last year, and raised our EBIT as a percentage of sales from 17% to 21%. So we aim for north of 20% EBIT margins. We do that with this optionality that Lori has outlined, and that's how we're going to run the business. Pricing for acetic acid, partly to your question, we think is more influenced by supply-demand dynamics versus methanol. Matthew DeYoe : That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. Just curious on the cash flow side. Do you think working capital is going to be a source of funds this year? And if so, could you size that for us just given the raw material backdrop? Todd Elliott : Yes, Arun, I don't know that it will be a huge source of funds. As we see business growth, it tends to be fairly neutral to possibly a slight increase in working capital. We're going to take -- continue to take aggressive actions around our controllable items in working capital to improve that, but I think it's going to be relatively flat. The big change in free cash flow year-over-year is going to be the increase in CapEx. So we expect capital to be around $500 million year-over-year and an expectation in our current cash flow forecast that we will have a payment to the European Commission. Operator : Our next question is coming from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Yes, Scott, just a follow-up on that. Can you talk a little bit more about the $89 million you reserved for the European Commission investigation? Where does that stand? Where might that hit to? Scott Richardson : Yes. Look, right now, Frank, I can't provide a lot of comments. I mean, based on everything we know to date from the commission, we don't expect to book any further reserve. And like I said, it's in our cash flow forecast for 2020. Frank Mitsch : Okay. And then, Lori, in the transcript, you highlighted the GM strike had a bigger-than-expected impact in your fourth quarter than anticipated. And you outlined some reasons for that in terms of the supply chain from the Tier 2 suppliers, et cetera. I'm curious, is this something that was -- if it didn't happen in the fourth quarter, is this something that could be a first quarter event? Do you expect this to rebound and impact your first quarter or perhaps second quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : No, we really don't. I would say, we hadn't really expected much impact at all from GM because our assumption was, once the strike was over, they start back up and kind of take that volume. They stayed down a bit longer, as did many of the auto builders, by the way, a bit longer through the holidays. And so we saw more of an impact, but we do not expect this to continue into the first and second quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. James Sheehan : Lori, are transformative M&A options now completely off the table because of potential dis-synergies? It sounds like in the past that you said that dis-synergies were not a barrier to considering that. So if that's off the table now, why is that the case? Lori Ryerkerk : I mean, so maybe I should clarify. Dis-synergies are not a barrier to consider. It is just a hurdle that has to be come over. So the deal has to be good enough to be able to carry those dis-synergies. So as I said before, we continuously look at M&A, both bolt-ons like the Elotex deal, which we've just closed as well as transformative M&A. If and when it happens, if it's a good deal, we'll do it. But we're trying to position our strategy so that M&A is an option for us, not a necessity. Scott Richardson : Yes, Jim. I mean, we've been very consistent on this over time. I mean, we are focused on creating shareholder value. And so we look at ways in which to do that. And that's both bolt-on as well as transformative, and those deals -- and those -- the things we look at there are really never off the table. James Sheehan : And on nylon pricing. The prices peaked in the first quarter of '19. So do you think that supply-demand has balanced out here? And that the first quarter of 2020, that these headwinds will be behind us? Or do you see more downside risk in the nylon dynamics into the second quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : I think -- look, I think our current view on nylon is it seems to be more balanced. We think we're through much of the destocking. There's still some inventory out there, but generally we would see it more balanced going into the year. Todd Elliott : Donna, let's make the next question our last one, please. Operator : Certainly. Our next question is coming from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : I had two questions on just cash flows here. So you provided free cash flow guidance of $900 million. Could you just talk about the split you're thinking about for 2020 between buybacks and M&A? And then the second question, your debt level has moved up a little bit in 2019. You're still within your leverage targets, but how should we think about debt in 2020? Would you look to repay any or perhaps take out some more? Scott Richardson : Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Matthew. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we are always very consistent in how we look at cash deployment. Our first choice of cash deployment is going to be organic investment back into the company. And given the projects, they're extremely attractive from a return standpoint today, as Lori talked about earlier, that CapEx is moving up over the next several years. And so we're going to be around $500 million of CapEx because those -- it's just the projects are extremely attractive. And historically, our return profile on that was right around 20%. That's always going to be our first choice. Then we look at M&A, and making sure we're very disciplined in looking at M&A, we're not overpaying and that we're acquiring companies that have high degrees of synergies. But those are going to be episodic. And so when we don't have M&A right in front of us, we're going to deploy that cash for share repurchases. So last year, we did $1 billion of repurchases. This year, given the fact we've already announced 1 M&A deal, I would see that number probably coming down a little bit. We're targeting at least $500 million this year.  Regarding debt, debt moved up a little bit as we pulled on the revolver. And the early part of the year for us is always high cash outflows. So Q1 is always a high cash outflow quarter for us. So you see that revolver stay pulled on a little bit higher in the early part of the year and then come down throughout the year over time as we have consistently done it. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chuck for closing comments. Chuck Kyrish : Thank you. So we'd like to thank everybody for listening in today. As usual, we're available after the call for any further questions you might have. Donna, feel free to close out the call at this time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's event. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Abe Paul, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Abe Paul : Thank you, Brock. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Abe Paul, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, our Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its first quarter earnings release via BusinessWire and posted prepared remarks about the quarter on our Investor Relations Web site yesterday after market close. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You will find the definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations of the comparable GAAP measures on our Web site. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as the prepared comments document. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. I will turn the call to Lori for opening remarks before we open the line directly for your questions. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you, Abe. Before we turn it over for questions, I would like to take a moment or two to make just a few comments. We all recognize the unprecedented challenges the world is facing right now. On behalf of Celanese, I want to extend our sympathy to all of those affected by the coronavirus pandemic and express our gratitude to those who are working tirelessly on the front line to keep us all safe. I want to acknowledge and thank our employees across the world each one has been impacted in some way. And amid their very individual circumstances, they have collectively performed exceptionally well. I particularly want to thank our manufacturing employees around the globe who have kept our plants running to make and ship products to our customers. I also want to acknowledge our employees working from home who are still supporting customers, closing deals, signing contracts and closing our books. Our first quarter earnings per share of $2.29 reflects their efforts, and was not far off from our original expectations before all this happened. The first quarter was tough and the reality is the second quarter is shaping up to be far more challenging. Simply put, we do not yet know how far demand will ultimately drop or how long this will last. We have tried to be transparent in sharing where we have visibility. Fortunately, one of our great strengths at Celanese is a culture of resiliency and a can-do attitude. I would like to thank Mark, who recently announced his retirement as our Executive Chairman for his support of me throughout the CEO transition, but also for fostering over many years the development of this remarkable Celanese culture. Our culture is one of actions. We have a lot we are working on to counter these challenges. I outlined much of that work yesterday in the script, and we are looking forward to doing much more. In this environment, we are focused on three imperatives; first, keeping our employees safe and healthy; two, driving resilient cash flow in 2020; and three position us for growth as we move into recovery. As a result of our work over many years, we are exceptionally well-positioned today to weather this environment. Celanese is leaner, more nimble and a more diversified company today than it has been at any other time in its history. Above all in my almost one year at Celanese, I have gained trust in our people and their ability to rise together to meet challenges. They have done it many times in our past, and I am confident they will do it again. We are collectively focused on driving long-term shareholder value and positioning ourselves for robust growth when these challenges pass. On the lighter note, like many of you we are all doing this from our homes today, so please be a bit patient if we have lags or speak over each other, or if you hear any strange noises in the background. With that, Abe, I'll turn it back over to you. Abe Paul : Thank you, Lori. Brock, you may now open the line directly for your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup. Please go ahead. P.J. Juvekar: I hope everybody is well. I have a question for you. You guys were making a long-term move to add downstream capacity VAM emulsions in the U. S., but with oil prices falling and natural gas prices kind of hanging in there. What's your take on the U. S. advantage? And how do you think the future regional capacity for Celanese breaks down? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it's a question we've been looking at ourselves, but let me try to put it a bit in perspective. We think the U. S. gas, even at these low oil prices, will continue to be well advantaged. So just to put that in perspective. If we look at the difference between let's say asset production between Clear Lake and Nanjing, our cost of production at Clear Lake is half as Nanjing, even at low oil prices. And Singapore, which is affected by low oil prices, but it just comes down slightly below the cost in Nanjing. So you still have a two to one advantage at Clear Lake, and that advantage rolls through VAM and VAE and everything else. So while we don't have as much advantage now in the U. S. Gulf Coast versus other producers, it is still a big advantage versus producing out coal or producing out of a low oil environment. So our plans have not changed. We will continue on pace with our VAE and our VAM expansions. We are slowing the acetic acid reconfiguration project as we noted in the script. Those productivity gains and the reason for doing that project are still intact, but we will pause it for a period of time to allow us to take advantage of these low oil cost environment and what that means for our Singapore operations. P.J. Juvekar: And a quick question for either you or Scott. You know, Mark Rohr had talked about for some time potential RMT transaction, given the pandemics and Mark's upcoming retirement. Would you think probability of a large transaction is lower now? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Our first priority has been and will always remain generating the most possible value for the shareholders, and we constantly look at options to do so. I think in the current environment that we're seeing demand environment this is difficult to do. Clearly, if you're looking at cash still that's very difficult in this environment as everyone's valuations are down. We do though think there continues to be room for mergers of equals or RMTs, and we think there will be even more opportunities for these things as we move towards full recovery. Operator : The next question is from Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Please go ahead. Duffy Fischer : I was wondering if you could just give us some help around the decremental margins you gave, some helpful quantitative numbers around what you think demand is going to do, acetyls is down 15 to 25. But say at the 15 level versus 25, is there going to be a difference in a decrementals and kind of same thing for EM, if you were? Just walk through how should we think about the profitability relative to the sales fall? Lori Ryerkerk : So let me talk a little bit about the guidance we gave for Q2. So what we indicated in the script is, we do expect to see in Q2 engineered material volumes down 25% to 35% versus Q1. Now with that, about two thirds of that volume is still relatively sticky in terms of pricing, so we would expect those margins to maintain, possibly even get a little better as well as continue to go down. At the same time, you know about a third of it is tied to raws so we'll see those prices go down, margins generally stick around the same. For acetyls, we project the volume decline of 15% to 25% and Q2 from Q1, couple things around that, India lockdown, Southeast Asia lockdown, we're just not seeing the volume demand there. And margins they\u2019re tend to follow, methanol and other things a bit. So probably expect to see our margins going down somewhat, but we would still expect acetyl margins in the mid teens or so. So we do expect some margin compression in AC, expect margins to be somewhere in EM but down with the volume. And if you look at what that just to maybe put some numbers around it. We saw a $25 million to $30 million hit in Q1 just from Asia. And Asia represents 20% of our overall business, and that was really in February and March. So consider that we've lost $10 million to $15 million per month on 20% of our business. It's not unreasonable to expect we would see a similar impact in Q2 on the other 80% of our business in the Western Hemisphere. So if you do the math on that, we do expect somewhere between $150 million to $250 million impact on Q2 EBIT, from the combination of volume and margin degradation. And how that -- as we go forward into Q3, Q4, we've done a lot of scenario planning, as I'm sure every company has, we think it's unlikely we're going to see a V-shape recovery. So coming back in Q3 that we do. We have done scenario planning around an U shape or L shape and broadly, expect Q3 to also be down but some recovery in Q4. But again, we don't really know how broad this is going to be. We don't know the degree of the downturn, nor do we know the duration and of course, Asia recovery, how fast that actually happens is a big factor. Duffy Fischer : And then could you speak to how you're JVs have performed vis-a-vis how you performed particularly in EM? I know at times over the last several years, Celanese has made the comment they saw some of those JVs were a little bit under managed on the cost side. So maybe just kind of walk through how you think they're doing versus the markets? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me start and then Scott may have some comments as well. So in general, I mean in first quarter, our JVs look good but generally our JVs report on a quarter lag. So we would expect some downturn in the second quarter for our JVs that may not show up so much until third quarter. Ibn Sina maybe slightly down more because it has a closer tie to crude, but that number and those JV numbers are baked into that $150 million to $250 million impact that we expect in Q2. Scott Richardson : Duffy, as we look at what our JVs are doing, they're very focused on cost right now as well. I mean, they're not immune to this environment, particularly our two JVs that are focused in Asia, were hit with some of the softness in demand that we saw in Q1 as well. And that will flow through a little bit into the second quarter. But hopefully, we'll start to see continued demand improvement, which will help them there but that doesn't mean that they take their foot off the gas on working the cost side of the equation as well. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Robert Koort : Lori, you surprised me a little bit with your commentary about how much better your cost position is in clearly than the Nanjing. Can you talk about how much it's compressed though or maybe what the broader industry cost curve has done over the last two or three months, is it substantially flattened or maybe characterize some of that for us? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say, we haven't seen a big shift in coal pricing, so that's really what drives Nanjing. So we haven't really seen compression between Clear Lake and Nanjing. The real compression is versus oil base, so like Singapore where everything's really priced out of bunker fuel. So, that's really where we've seen the compression, not as much advantage as we used to have between U. S. natural gas rate base and oil base. So Singapore and some of the European producers for example, they tend to be oil based, that's where we've seen the compression. But again, what we've seen, at least in the low oil environment so far is just we still have kind of a 2 times advantage in the Gulf Coast as we do in other location. Robert Koort : And then I guess China's economy is directed in a different way or managed in a different way, but it seems like that recovery is in the manufacturing sector, at least started pretty aggressively. How would you anticipate any cues from China informing what might happen in the Western markets for you as we go through the second and third quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : So I think what we need to watch for in China, well, a couple of things. So you're right, people are up and starting to run again in China. We see some China internal demand recovering. I would say two watch out and one -- and maybe the reason we're a little bit more pessimistic on AC at this point than others, as we are starting to see inventory build in China. So people are running, but there's not a lot of exports yet from China. And so, we are starting to see some build up there. And so, I think until you see more of the Western hemisphere start to recover and you see consumers\u2019 confidence come back, maybe some of the stimulus packages, especially for auto that are coming on, that's really going to drive the demand around the world, allow China to start exporting again. I think that's what we need to wait and see. And as of right now, we really haven't seen a resumption yet of China exports. Again, not a big impact on us directly but a big impact on some of our customers around the globe. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeff Zekauskas : With oil prices coming down, some of your competitors probably have a lower cost structure than they did before. Does that lead to a weaker supply-demand balance in acetic or VAM? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me talk about again about China, because I think that's generally the swing producer. We saw a lot of China production online in the fourth quarter. We've actually seen some reduction in utilization in the first quarter, because of the very low pricing that we're seeing, I think people are choosing to run at lower rates, not necessarily shutdown but running at lower rates. So I think the thing is that price is just so low. So especially in China, we're at maybe $300 per metric ton today. We saw that price down in the $260 range early in April. It was at $300 or less in March, that's just not a price where folks can run out of a coal base and it's not a great price even out of an oil base as compared to natural gas. So I think the advantage is there, it's less. I don't think it will impact our Clear Lake, but it is causing some producers to slow down, which is a good thing. And we've actually seen the price start creeping up again in the last few weeks from where it was. So there seems to be some discipline in the market, not to produce into a losing situation. But again, it depends how long this goes on. But right now I would say, you know coal is the marginal producer, which is China. And we are seeing some discipline in that market and we're seeing prices slowly come back up. Scott Richardson : Jeff, just to add to that. I think it's important to remember that our view of oil is that we're relatively agnostic as a corporation to hire low oil pricing. And you are going to get some compression in some areas, but you're going to get expansion in other areas. I think I've already just talked about on acetic acid, you know you would not see a lot of movement in that cost curve. On VAM, you do get some compression but that's offset by some of the gains you get out of Singapore acetic acid. On the engineered material side of the equation as already stated, about two thirds of the pricing there's pretty sticky. So you hold pricing even as raws come down, but that's partially offset by our dividend out of Ibn Sina. So with those puts and takes, we feel like we can still generate pretty agnostic returns in any environment. Jeff Zekauskas : Can you talk about why you\u2019ve deferred your larger capital projects? What the rationale is behind that? And how much operating income or EBITDA do you lose because of the deferral? Lori Ryerkerk : So we've reduced our CapEx projection for this year by about $150 million could be a bit more. of that, I'd say about a third of it is associated with the delay of the Clear Lake acetic acid expansion. Again, the reason for doing that is because with these low oil prices, Singapore becomes a much more, not more attractive in Clear Lake, but attractive enough that we decided it was better to preserve cash in this period of time not knowing how long and how deep this would be. We can choose to start that project up at any time once we start to see recovery or for right now we've just said 18 months. We've also, for our China localization projects that we were looking at, we've pushed it out a bit, because obviously we have a bit of a demand slowdown for our engineered materials, and we see that taking a little while to recover. So we've pushed it out a bit and we've also had some things change where we now are looking at minimizing costs by using some of our existing footprint preferably. So that's about another third, about $150 million. And then have a third that's kind of everything else, and a lot of that is just project re-scoping that occurred naturally, projects that we said to preserve cash and we can just push them out a year. So we're really just trying to be cautious, because we don't know how deep and how long this can go to make sure that we are preserving cash for the organization to maintain a good free cash flow. Operator : The next question is from Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Sison : Lori, I just want a little bit of clarification. I think you said for 2Q, adjusted EBIT could be down 150 to 250 . Was that relative to Q1 or 2Q \u201819? Lori Ryerkerk : Relative to Q1. Michael Sison : And then when you think about adjusted EBIT margins for the Acetyl Chain in the mid teens for 2Q. What is more important in getting those margins up, is it the volume, is it the pricing? And then if pricing is going to go up, what do you think drives that? Is it more oil going up? Is it more recouping of volume? Just some colour on what could get those margins better as the year unfolds? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think they're all related. But I think it is more around the pricing. I mean, the last time we saw below $300 per metric ton pricing for acetic acid was in 2016. So it's been a long time since we've seen this level of numbers. So I think it really is more about seeing the pricing go up. Now, that really means demand recovery for acetic acid really dependent on China for that. I think that's where we'll see the recovery in the margins. But clearly as we have demand recovery, we get some bond recovery that helps the prices go up. Again, we're pretty agnostic to what happens to oil in this scenario - that's the beauty of our models, beauty of having three different sources of acetic acid around the globe that we can pull on depending on what's the best source and lowest cost source? So I don't see oil price being a big factor for us. But certainly, China demand, China exports, reopening of India and Southeast Asia, these are going to be the big factors that can help drive those margins backup. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vincent Andrews : Good morning, and good to hear everybody's voice. Sounds like everyone's doing well. I'm wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing or what you're thinking about the outlook for demand for VAM and for emulsions in the second quarter and maybe into the third quarter. Just wondering if you're going to have the same amount of flexibility going forward to shift product out of acid and into those other two materials? Lori Ryerkerk : So we have certainly taken advantage of that flexibility even in the first quarter. I mean, if you look in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, we sold 17% less tonnage into China. As they dealt with COVID, we moved that and we sold 27% more tonnage into the Western Hemisphere. We moved 8% more tonnage to VAM and emulsion. We have seen VAM and VAE hold up pretty well. We actually see some impact on that into the second quarter. We see the demand remaining strong for paints and coatings at least so far, especially for exterior paint. Now, maybe not as much for interior paints as people are wanting to line up at Home Depot and wait to go in. But we are seeing the advantage of that capacity that we've been able to add. So I think in Q2, yes, we expect certainly some pricing pressure on VAM and VAE and emulsions. And we hope we'll start to see some more seasonal recovery in demand as we see economy starting to reopen, but generally stronger than acetic acid. Vincent Andrews : And then if I could just ask you on an engineered materials, I appreciate and respect your comments on the ability to hold price in that two-thirds of that business, that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve seen in the past in lower raw material environments. I'm just asking with volume expected to be down 30%, 35%. Is there is there no mechanism for customers to come to you and ask for lower prices? Is it fully contracted or is it just not something you have to worry about? Lori Ryerkerk : I mean, of course people can always ask. Again, if we go back to what we see, about a third of that volume is really sticky, and that we\u2019re the only person specked in. So they tend to not be price sensitive, they don\u2019t have another option. The next third maybe has a couple people specked in. We've not seen a lot of movement that way. I mean, perhaps we will as we come up we haven't. The third that tends to be more price sensitive is more of the standard type grade and those tend to follow raws a bit more anyway. But we have seen some of the sectors continue to be very robust, medical pharma, paints and coatings to a certain extent, packaging from the acetyl side, food and beverage has been robust. So we expect those to continue and not to see a lot of price pressure there. Operator : The next question is from Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. Please go ahead. Ghansham Panjabi : So Lori, just on EM segment specific to the first quarter, both volumes and margins were quite resilient, considering the late quarter sort of slow down globally. Was there any pull full forward of demand from 2Q? I mean you mentioned that the team generated high single-digit volume growth in the Western Hemisphere. Just trying to clarify that. Lori Ryerkerk : No, we really didn't see any pull forward. Auto actually was doing quite well in January and February in the Western Hemisphere. We actually had seen auto up a few percent in both Europe and Asia, and that really helped to drive some of the volumes in the first and second quarter. Obviously, consumer goods were down in the first quarter but generally, January, February, even the first part of March were pretty good, where the Western Hemisphere was able to offset some of the decline that we saw out of Asia. And even the Asia decline during that period was fairly moderate. Now, obviously that all changed kind of the second half of March and that's why we're projecting the 25% to 30% down for EM in the second quarter. But I really didn't see much volume pull forward. Ghansham Panjabi : And just more broadly, I mean you have obviously given us an assumption for each of the segments from a volume standpoint for 2Q. Can you give us a sense as to what you're embedding in terms of how June kind of plays out? I mean, clearly, most of the world's has got locked down for at least let's say half of the quarter. But how are you thinking about the back part of the quarter and kind of the exit run rate into the third quarter? Thanks so much. Lori Ryerkerk : We just looked at the second quarter as a whole. We\u2019re really assuming we don't see much recovery even through June. And if we look at auto, for example, China autos restarted but it's a bit slow. Europe is kind of starting this week, but a pretty low rate. BW for example in the ID-3, one of their platforms that we have a lot of content in, is making 50 cars a day versus what they typically make 150 cars a day. The U. S., autos are just now starting to announce they're going to restart originally some May 4th, some May 11th, most of the big plants, not till May 18th. So, we really don't see them coming up closer to full rate until late June or even early July. So, that's the effect when we break in. Obviously, as they get started sooner that's good. Operator : The next question is from Matthew DeYoe of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Matthew DeYoe : So if we look back at 2015 and 2016, the acetyl chain business generated about $600 million in annual EBITDA. Perhaps directionally you're pointing there in 2Q, but we have some outages and whatnot. So why or why not is it possible that the company kind of returns in that EBITDA in that segment? We'll start there. Lori Ryerkerk : We typically assume, we think our acetyls business is kind of a base level of earnings in a normal environment between 180 and 200. So if you look at our earnings in first quarter, just call it 144 for easy math. You know we had about 15 million in there for the -- that we didn't have for the fairway turnaround, there was 15 million to 20 million of COVID impact. And then first quarter, typically we see 10 million to 15 million of seasonality. So that gets us in that one 180 million to 190 million range that we would expect to see from acetyls. So I think what we\u2019ve showing is versus even 16, 17, we have fundamentally shifted the acetyls base level of earnings again, kind of up to that 180 to 190 but with COVID, with the turnaround , the first quarter we saw slightly lower number in the first quarter. A - Scott Richardson : Matthew, I think it's important to remember a lot of the steps that we've taken over time in the acetyl business to get us to that higher level of earnings. Reducing the fixed cost footprint, consolidating manufacturing at our large integrated facilities, continuing to lower the S&A cost structure in the business. And then further going downstream, in the past, we used to sell about 60% of our acetic acid as acetic acid and now we only sell closer to 40%. And we moved that downstream into a VAM emulsion and now into redisposable powders through the Elotex acquisition. So those very purposeful steps taken over time have led to that higher level of earnings in normalized environments. Matthew DeYoe : And then it's price in EM was down 5% year-over-year in 1Q, I would imagine it's probably going to be a little bit worse than that in 2Q. To some extent, I guess it's not surprising given the moves we've seen in the oil. But if I look back to the last time, crude really collapsed in \u201815, \u201816. We never saw a price kind of eclipse the minus 4 number. Is this because price isn't as sticky in some of the newly acquired businesses and you talked a little bit about that margin level and I would imagine things moved down in 2Q, but that mid 30s, what you\u2019d consider normal from here? Lori Ryerkerk : I think there's two things there. So we did have the raw material pass through on that kind of third of the business that is more directly tied to raws. I think that's similar to what you would have seen in \u201816. There was also an element, Q1 \u201819 was really an exceptional EM quarter and there's some timing elements there around contracts for medical and pharma some high margin businesses that showed up in Q1, which is different than Q1 \u201820. So Q1 \u201819, we had some big contracts that showed up in the book. Q1 \u201820 is, I would say more normal. So there is that variation there. I mean, we would expect as raws continues to be low and as we see volumes come off, some further impact to margins for engineered materials and volumes, like I spoke about earlier. But I don't think that Q1 \u201819 to Q1 \u201820 change that you're seeing is representative, because there were some uniqueness in Q1 \u201819. Operator : The next question is from John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead. John Roberts : Thank you. And congratulations, Lori, on assuming the chair person role. The smokers seem to be more susceptible to the more severe COVID-19 symptoms. They're guiding for stable cig tow for the rest of this year. But do you think this over the next 12, 24, 48 months, will accelerate the decline in cig tow overtime? Lori Ryerkerk : You know, it's a good question and one we've asked ourselves. But I have to say tow has proven to be probably our most resilient sector. People who smoke tend to do it no matter what, and if anything, maybe they do it more when they're home. So just a bit anecdotally, in January and February when this was really hitting China, we actually saw tow production, cigarette production up 4% in China, and sales in China actually went up by 1%, which -- that versus 2019, which doesn't sound like a lot but in a business where we expect, a couple of percent decline per year, that was certainly a reversal of the trend. We haven't seen similar numbers yet for Europe and for the Americas. So we have to wait and see. But as of right now at least in our conversations with the cigarette producers and others, they are not seeing a big change in demand profile. John Roberts : And then in engineered materials, you noted some challenges in getting new applications qualified with social distancing, while your customers having employees working from home. Do you think you have that solved or will have it solved over the next couple of months, or will it be constraining it any in any way, because demand is so weak it's just not going to be a constraining part of the supply chain or the value added? Lori Ryerkerk : I mean, look it's a great question. And certainly with COVID, we have found many new ways of working. I would say our employees or even ourselves, people, everyone continues to be highly productive and effective at home. Interestingly enough in EM, while we have had some issues getting new projects qualified, we have been able to continue to progress many other projects. So a lot of our customers have lab staff working, they're doing it. In some cases, our lab group, our technology and innovation group has actually been working with some of the customers to qualify the materials on our lab equipment. And so sometimes we've actually taken over and done some of the testing for them at our facilities for those customers who couldn't use theirs. So our folks have been really creative to keep some stuff going. Similarly, we've continued to provide great customer service. I want to share with you an example we had. We actually had a customer in Germany who had a moulding issue and our technologists were able to get on the phone via iPad and basically troubleshoot the problem, using iPad video with the customer. So our folks have been really creative. While we certainly have, we still closed the number of projects in the first quarter we expected to, we aim to do the same in the second quarter. We're just having to be really creative and really flexible in how we work and what work we do for our customers to make it happen. Operator : The next question is from John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John McNulty : With regard to the acetic acid markets in China specifically. Have you seen any permanent closures? And I guess how long would we have to see this recessionary environment drag on before we might actually start to see some of maybe the more marginal capacity just get permanently shut down? What are your thoughts on that? Lori Ryerkerk : So I would say to-date, we have not seen any permanent closures. And part of the reason for that is I think a lot of the acetic acid capacity in China is tied to downstream uses at the same company. So, they're part of the value chain for other companies, not necessarily VAM, VAE, but maybe going into plastic bottles or this sort of thing. So, what we've seen though is we have seen people slowing down capacity, so only matching their capacity to what they internally consume. I think, it will take a bit longer at these kinds of prices before we see people permanently shut down. But we have definitely seen people take, go run at lower rates, which has helped. We were really low in terms of tiny utilization in the first quarter. Those numbers are still low, just below 70%, but slowly coming back up if people cut back on runway rates to more match their downstream, internal downstream consumption. So, I don't know how long it's going to be, but I think it will be longer before we see any permanent shutdown of spare capacity in China. Scott Richardson : And John, we're focused on what we can do to control things. So we're controlling our own operating rates. We're focused on productivity, as Lori talked about. We're focused on what we can do from near-term cost reduction actions. So, those items that we have control over ourselves is where our focus needs to be. So as we see the changes in demand pivot in the coming months, we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. John McNulty : And then just I guess with regard to the engineered materials platform, I guess the magnitude of the sales drop seems a little bit on the higher end I guess than what we were thinking, especially considering you do serve some pretty defensive markets as well, like on the healthcare side. So I guess can you give us in terms of how you're thinking about the buckets of your cyclical portion of that business and maybe defensive side. What you're thinking in terms of the volumes for those? Lori Ryerkerk : I mean, on the kind of resilience side, I mean obviously I talk about tow, that's 15% of our revenue. And then we have medical pharma, food beverage, even 5G, packaging, that's kind of another 10% to 15% of our revenue. But some of our big users like for the entire company autos is about 15%. Until people start up, although, they're sticky businesses and they will come back and order from us, they're just not taking volume. So, that's really what's built into that, as well as consumer electronics and people are just not buying big durable consumer goods right now. They're worried about jobs. They can't get out. All these kinds of things. So I would say, it's not so much that we see people shifting away from our engineered materials. It's just they're not running so they're not ordering. If you look at even in Q1, we saw -- we lost about $10 million in volume in orders just in March through the cancellations, about 50% nation, 50% in other places. And in Q2, automotive is a big decline drop. I mean, April was 50% lower in terms of automotive demand for us than it was in 2019, and in the America that was 80% lower. So, these are sticky businesses but if they're not running, they're not ordering. Now in non-auto, we're nearly flat for 2019. So again, it's just that balance of those highly resilient, those that have kept running and had high demand and those that haven't been as resilient like auto where we've just seen the demand basically go to zero for a period of time. Operator : The next question is from Kevin McCarthy of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kevin McCarthy : With regard to your CapEx program, I think you indicated you're deferring capacity expansions for methanol and acetyls by about 18 months. Do you still plan to reduce capacity in Asia? And if so, will the acetyl capacity reduction there be concurrent with the new timeline? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so our plan all along has been it was really we justified the product, that project on productivity. So our plan would be to reduce capacity in Asia in that same timeframe. So in that \u201820 to mid 2023 timeframe. Again, it could be a shutdown of the facility or it could just simply be a reduction in facility. And that's a decision we'll make sometime later once we see kind of how raw material dynamics and demand even out over the next few years. Kevin McCarthy : And then on Page 9 of your prepared remarks release last night, I just had a clarifying question maybe. You're talking about the free cash flow improvement there of 300 million to 400 million, and I think it's equated to 40% decline in adjusted EBIT for acetyl chain and EM. I guess my clarification is, is that 40% in fact your forecast, or are you just sizing the magnitude of the free cash flow improvement there? Scott Richardson : Kevin, we're just sizing it for Q2 through Q4, that's really what that point was about. Kevin McCarthy : And if I may, I want to sneak in another one for you, Scott. There's a reference to I think a tax relief provision that's expected to benefit you by $40 million to $50 million. Can you just talk a little bit about that and when you would expect that cash in the door? Scott Richardson : Yes, this is mostly just timing, Kevin, and it's a lot of the stimulus packages that have been passed around the world. Actually the lesser of that number is the U. S., we have a pretty substantial impact from German payroll tax deferrals. So it's really just deferment to 2021 or 2022 on payroll taxes. Operator : The next question is from Alex Yefremov of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Alex Yefremov : Lori, just to clarify, EBIT decline sequentially, you mentioned 150 million to 250 million range. Was that for the company overall or for EM segment only? Lori Ryerkerk : No, that's for the company overall. Alex Yefremov : And turning to acetyls, just based on benchmark margins we're estimating that they were quite healthy in March and April if we look at acetic acid versus methanol, or VAM versus ethylene and acetic acid. Is that in fact true when you look at your business? And if so, are you expecting this level of margins that we saw in March and April to persist in the latter parts of second quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Scott may want to provide some detail as well. But you know again, if we look at, we actually saw prices drop very low at the end of March and in early April. And you know at those kind of prices margins in Nanjing where you have methanol coming out of coal are not that good. Clear Lake out of gas still a margin, but significantly compressed from the margins that we've had in the past. So I think we continue to see that challenge with acetyl margins going forward even in the low methanol environment again, because price tends to fall a little bit. Scott Richardson : I think we did seek a lot of compression in the first quarter, as Lori stated, Aleksey. And in the last week, we've seen a slight bit of expansion but we saw these periods and pockets at various points in the first quarter as well. So until we see I think more robust exports moving out of China and demand improving in other parts of the world, I don't think you're going to see a big change in that dynamic. Alex Yefremov : If I just may clarify, you do expect your acetyls margins to decline sequentially? Scott Richardson : No, I think we expect to see things relatively flat right now Aleksey, that's we\u2019re baking in, given that demand landscape that we talked about. And I think it's important, we're more or less on the floor here for methanol in China given where the coal producers\u2019 cost structure is and given where methanol prices are at. So we may see things move a little bit in the upstream feedstock landscape, but material movements up or down, given the inventory levels and given the cost structure, we just don't don't see things moving a lot. Operator : The next question is from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead. Frank Mitsch : As I parse through the various forecasts and understanding this isn\u2019t an exact science. Where you think the coronavirus impact is, I mean, obviously very significant impact here in 2Q. But as I look at the numbers, is it fair to say that as things stand today you think the impact from coronavirus, if we were to say parse up 100% for the balance of the year, it would be like 50% impact in Q2, I don't know 30% in Q3 and 20% in Q4. How are you currently thinking about the pace of the impact for the balance of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : We've done a lot of scenario planning and again, we don't expect a V-shaped recovery. So we do expect some continued impact. We've looked at U-shape recovery, which we'll start to see some recovery in December. We look at L shape, which has it going down into 2021. I think the answer is, we don't know even with things opening up, we have yet to see. Couple of things when does the Western Hemisphere automakers return to full production, when will we see enough relaxing the social distancing in the U. S. and Europe for people to go back to painting and as well as allow for construction to go back to seasonally normalised levels. And then as I said earlier, when do we see that improvement in China export, because we're not seeing that yet. So even though China is running, we're not seeing enough demand outside of China to really resume the pace of China export. So I think there's still a lot of unknown, a lot related to consumer confidence, stimulus packages can help. We're waiting to see how that stuff goes. But I don't think we can really predict accurately at this point what we will see in third and fourth quarter. Frank Mitsch : But I was looking at that comment from Scott about the acetyls and EM being off 40% for the balance of the year. And so it just seemed to me that it was a bit more front end loaded in terms of the impact for the second quarter and perhaps in terms of the year-over-year negative impact, it would be lessened for the balance of the year. But at this point, do you think it's maybe a little bit too premature to offer that? Scott Richardson : Yes, that 40% was really illustrative of what that magnitude of cash flow reduction would magnitude of cash flow reduction would equate to. So that's how I read that. Operator : The next question is from Matthew Blair of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead. Matthew Blair : Good morning, glad to hear everyone is safe. I want to touch on that 5% of volume gain in acetyls, which I think occurred despite some turnarounds. Would you say that was just normal quarter-to-quarter volatility or do you have a strategy to try to take share in this weak market and offset some of the price declines? Lori Ryerkerk : So we had the volume gain from fourth quarter. Remember, in fourth quarter we had the issue at our Clear Lake plant and it was down. And so, we had more volume available in Clear Lake obviously in Q1 than we did in Q4. So, that volume uptake really reflects the additional production in Clear Lake offset slightly by the COVID impact in Asia. Matthew Blair : And then any sense on the timing of the $150 million to $250 million working capital benefit that you expect? Would that be mostly in Q2 or kind of spread throughout the year? Thanks. Scott Richardson : So I think , there can be a chunk of that that is Q2 as we see the more acute demand impact that Lori talked about happening in the current environment, and we will gain working capital here. So, we will see that. We do expect with really actions that we're taking and this is not a new thing for us. We've been heavily working by working capital actions around accounts receivable, accounts payable over the last several years. And this environment really gives us that opportunity to push hard on the inventory side of the equation also. So, there's some sustainable actions that we're taking in addition to just kind of the drop from sales coming off. So, we'll gain a lot of working capital in the second quarter, but we do expect some of those actions to yield benefits in the back half also. Operator : The next question is from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. David Begleiter : Lori, Scott on the acetyls base earnings 180 to 190. I know you said you're agnostic to oil price changes. But why isn't there some variability at $25 oil price versus $50 oil price for the base level of earnings in that segment? Lori Ryerkerk : So David, I think what we\u2019d say as a company, we're fairly agnostic. I mean you will see a little bit of an impact in AC, which is my bridge including seasonality gets you to the lower end of that 180 to 200. Clearly, you will see some impact in AC. But that said, we see a little bit of an offset in EM where our prices don't typically for about two-thirds of our volume, the prices don't track down with raws. And so we get a little bit of margin expansion in EM that offsets the compression of margins we see in AC. David Begleiter : And just in EM just on the affiliates, what's happening with Ibn Sina given the low MTBE margins these days? Scott Richardson : So David, our dividend there's on a one quarter lag. So what came through in Q1 is what we saw from Q4 and then likewise here stepping through into Q2. So we're going to see most of that impact in the second half of the year that we're seeing MTBE follows oil, so pricing is coming down and we will get some compression there. On the flip side in the EM segment, you'll get upside from where we get margin expansion where we have pretty sticky pricing as we talked about earlier. Operator : The next question is Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Laurence Alexander : Do you see any opportunities to or do you have any interest in acquiring downstream acetyls assets and then hold them into your network to further optimize or give you more degrees of freedom? And secondly, can you remind us where you are on the innovation cycle in acetyls? I mean, roughly how many years [Technical Difficulty] before we see significant innovation in OpEx and CapEx on new projects? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, you broke up a little bit, but let me answer the first one. So I mean clearly, we just completed the acquisition of Elotex that is adding down to the backend of our acetyl chain with redisposable powders. We're really excited to have close that deal despite having to do it remotely. It is a fast growing market and we think it's a great addition so we do continue. I think it's just an example, we do continue to be very interested and continuing to expand our assets sale chain where it makes sense to deliver greater shareholder value, which we think Elotex did that. In terms of innovation, I mean we continue to be very flexible with our acetyl chain. We like the model that we have, which gives us a lot of optionality and gives us a lot of ability to pivot. I gave the example earlier of the amount of tonnage we can move geographically, as well as tonnage downstream. Our teams continue to innovate constantly around VAM and emulsions, and offering new products to our customers. So I think we're doing very well there. Operator : The next question is from Jim Sheehan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jim Sheehan : When we look at natural gas prices in Asia and specifically China, they're moving lower into the region naturally of coal prices. I'm wondering how you think that's impacting competitive dynamics in China? How sustainable might that be and does that really affect the acetyl chain at all? Lori Ryerkerk : I don't really know much about natural gas these days, so I can't say how sustainable that will be. What I will tell you is acetic asset equipment in China is built around coal to methanol base. It would take an amount of investment in order to convert that to natural gas and ethanol base. So I don't see that happening quickly. I think you would have to have a very sustained period of competitive and low natural gas prices, as well as some assurity of continued supply before you saw people willing to make that investment away from coal to natural gas. Scott Richardson : Jim, natural gas is earmarked for personal consumption. There's very little chemical production based upon natural gas, and we just haven't seen a policy shift in that direction. Jim Sheehan : And on social distancing, you know you talked about the impacts that might have on new project development. I'm wondering about maybe you could comment on how it's affecting your integration of acquisitions like Elotex? Lori Ryerkerk : Social distancing, besides the fact that we have about 2,000 people working from home these days, we still have another roughly 6,000 people working in our plants. And so we have learned how to operate with social distancing using personal protective equipment as needed. I think that's gone very well and we've been very fortunate. We've had no cases of COVID-19 transmitted at work. And so, I think we can learn to operate in this way. I think it's been good. I think people other -- we see the same thing in other industries, and socially people are learning to work this way, but we just need to get consumer confidence back. Operator : That concludes our time for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Abe Paul for closing remarks. Abe Paul : Thank you, Brock. We thank you for your questions and listening in today. As usual, we are available after the call for further questions you might have. Brock, feel free to close out the call at this time. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Abe Paul, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Abe Paul : Thank you, Jesse. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Abe Paul, Vice President, Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its second quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared remarks about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday after market close. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today\u2019s presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release, as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have been also submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we will now open the line directly for your questions. Jesse, go ahead and open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. Nice quarter. You noted that Asia auto builds have recovered. Was your Asian Engineered Material sales up year-over-year as well? And do you think that will accelerate in Asia after the Polyplastics deal? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, John. We are seeing \u2013 we have seen the recovery in Asia. I mean, Asia was up about 2%. But I think year-over-year, we really expect Asia to be pretty flat to 2019. John Roberts : Okay. And then you pivoted acetyls to emulsions and powders over VAM. Can you characterize the range of swing possible between VAM, emulsions and powders in your mix? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Maybe just to give you an idea, I mean, so we actually moved about just over 15% more into emulsions, as an example, in the quarter. We moved kind of 1% more into VAM. We moved more acetic acid and other derivatives back into China since that was a little bit more robust market, even though the margins were a bit lower. I mean, generally, we characterize it as we have the ability to move anywhere from 40% to 60% of our acetic acid into downstream derivative. John Roberts : Okay. So it\u2019s a 20% range then. Great. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Hi. Thank you, and good morning. Just want to square a couple of the outlook comments. Starting in the Acetyl Chain, you mentioned flat 3Q versus 2Q. And you also mentioned that, you don\u2019t expect prices to improve until demand gets back to pre-COVID levels. And then later in the comments, you talked about 2021 being as an opportunity for demand levels to be greater than 2019. So I wanted to make sure that comment was also meant to apply to acetic to the Acetyl Chain? And if you think that sort of will be the trajectory? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So on the Acetyl Chain, I mean, we do expect some volume recovery, modest volume recovery in Q3. We aren\u2019t expecting, though, a big change in pricing. As we said, there\u2019s still a lot of available capacity in the world. So we think that puts a limit on the pricing. Look, we are seeing some improvement in methanol pricing in early Q3. We are seeing some improvement in acetic acid pricing, so maybe even slightly up margins at the beginning of Q3. But we don\u2019t really see the fundamentals yet to really think maybe that\u2019s sustainable for the whole quarter. You might remember in second quarter, we also saw a bit of an uptick in margins early in the quarter, but that really flattened out as the quarter went on. So right now, we\u2019re saying modest volume recovery, pretty flat margins and that \u2013 but that volume \u2013 but we do have some smaller turnarounds in Q3 in Cangrejera, Frankfurt and Singapore, which kind of offsets that modest volume recovery. So that\u2019s why right now, we\u2019re calling it essentially flat. Again, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of margin expansion early in the quarter. But right now, we don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to sustain. But clearly, if it does, that will be a help. Scott Richardson : Yes. And I think, if you look at\u2026 Vincent Andrews : Okay. Scott Richardson : Sorry, Vincent\u2026 Vincent Andrews : No, go ahead. Go ahead. Scott Richardson : \u2026if you look at your question for 2021, it\u2019s still early on the Acetyl Chain. We don\u2019t have that long of visibility. But we do \u2013 we are anticipating, given conversations with customers that demand will be improved versus 2020 at least at the current outlook. We\u2019ll have to see if it gets up to 2019 levels or not, we did see a fair amount of destocking in 2019 in the business. But that 2021 comment was probably a little more related to Engineered Materials. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And I did want to follow-up on the destocking and the seasonality comments that you made for 4Q. I mean, obviously, recognizing 4Q in a normal year is a destocking quarter. This is obviously not a normal year when you look at sort of the volume of 2Q. And I recognize it\u2019s very hard to predict 4Q at this point, let alone August. But are you just sort of being conservative assuming that customers will destock in 4Q, because what they always do? Or is it possible this year, just because it\u2019s been such a strange year with such a soft 2Q that we don\u2019t actually have a down 4Q sequentially versus 3Q, because customers\u2019 demand is still coming back and customers don\u2019t have the inventory levels to really do it. How are you thinking about that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I would say, Vincent, we\u2019re really assuming normal seasonality. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s as much destocking as just slightly lower demands as demands come off in fourth quarter for construction and some materials and other things. So not really destocking as much as just normal reduction in demand. Now, look, we\u2019re keeping our options open. We\u2019re \u2013 maybe with the abnormal second quarter we have, we\u2019ll see people continue to run a bit stronger in 4Q. We\u2019ve seen that in some years, but we\u2019re not assuming that at this time, because, again, we just don\u2019t have the visibility that far out. So we\u2019re just assuming a kind of a normal level of demand drop off associated with fourth quarter. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Scott Richardson : Yes. Vincent, that Q4 demand in acetyls tends to be weather-related in construction, paints and coatings and our emulsions business. So, we think that will probably come to fruition, where we may not see as much of an impact is on the Engineered Materials side. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see. Even though we\u2019re bringing turnarounds forward into this year, we have enough flexibility in our volumes that if we don\u2019t see that destocking or that seasonality in EM, then we should be able to respond. Vincent Andrews : Okay, very good. I appreciate the help. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Robert Koort : Thank you very much. Lori, I was wondering you guys said, back at the last big Investor Day, talked about some aggressive, but maybe not specific timeframe for some acetic and VAM expansions. Can you just give us an update in light of what\u2019s gone on this year? How that\u2019s changed your view, if at all? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Bob. So, the acetic acid expansion was really around the reconfiguration. So the expansion at Clear Lake, coupled with some productivity moves in Asia. So as we said last quarter, we have delayed that project for about 18 months, really in response to the reduced demand dynamics we\u2019ve seen for acetic acid, as well as the low oil price environment, which makes Singapore look somewhat more attractive and closer to Gulf Coast natural gas pricing. So that\u2019s the big move in acetic acid. We\u2019ve also announced some expansions of VAM and VAE facilities. Those continue on schedule, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before, so we\u2019re really talking in the 2022-plus timeframe, because we really see the demand for those products. And as it applies now with Elotex and with others, we see a very robust future for VAM and VAE and other downstream derivatives of acetic acid. So those continue on schedule. Acetic acid is delayed about 18 months. Robert Koort : And in EM, I\u2019m just curious, given the pretty extreme volatility in a lot of polymer pricing. Has that provided some opportunity? Is there some threat there from intermaterial substitution? Can you just sort of talk about your development efforts with customers there in light of all this volatility? What\u2019s that done to the whole process that you guys have in terms of the innovation and new product wins and that sort of thing? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, I think there has been a number of opportunities that have come up in Engineered Materials. So, one opportunity we\u2019ve seen probably more so than price volatility, I would say, is around desire to have more certainty on supply chain. And so we have seen inquiries from customers and wanting to get product within the region that they\u2019re going to use it to derisk some of their supply chain. So that\u2019s been a few opportunities for us. And we also just see a lot of opportunity consistent with what we\u2019ve laid out as our strategy. So really more aggressive movement into electric vehicles. We\u2019ve seen a lot more opportunities there, especially for some of our recycled products like ECOMID and some of our flame retardant nylon. We\u2019ve seen more opportunities there for lightweighting. We just see electric vehicles, which obviously is also getting a lot of help here in the COVID environment from stimulus packages and things, especially in Europe and Asia. That has been a focus for us for the last 18 months now. And we see it really developing to where, for example, the accessible market for us in electric vehicles is about 30% greater for Celanese products than it is in traditional vehicles. So, we\u2019ve seen 5G is another area, more focus on medical pharma. That has \u2013 that provided some opportunity. So I think, some of the strategic focuses that we\u2019ve laid out in the last year, we\u2019ve really seen strengthened through COVID, as well as some new ones developing around things like people wanting more materials that are resistant to the use of disinfectants and sterilization, as well as more focus on pharma compliance. So, we actually see a lot of opportunities in Engineered Materials and are pretty optimistic about the level of project wins we had despite the \u2013 in a COVID environment. Robert Koort : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on EM. When you look across your suite of all the different polymers with the weaker demand, have you seen any erosion or material erosion in pricing caused by that weaker demand? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say across the Board on average, no. In fact, we probably saw a little bit of margin expansion in the second quarter with lower raw material. And we should see that raw material advantage continue, because there\u2019s always a big of a lag in raw material advantage. And so, while in some end applications like consumer and industrial, there has certainly been an automotive. There has been a softer demand and some of that has maybe tightened up pricing and others like electrical and medical. We\u2019ve seen higher demand and we \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen improved pricing. So, on average, I\u2019d say, our margin \u2013 variable margin has been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. And if anything, we\u2019re seeing just a little bit of margin expansion overall. Duffy Fischer : Okay. And then if we just move to Tow, the pandemic influence on cigarettes in your Tow business, I mean, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a respiratory disease. I can\u2019t imagine smoking a cigarettes is enjoyable trying to wear a mask. Have you seen any influence on demand for either cigarettes or your Tow business because of COVID? Lori Ryerkerk : No, not at all. We have not seen any impact on demand or any impact actually on smoking trends. In fact, if you look at China, China through June is showing a 2% increase in demand for cigarettes. And anecdotally, even in the U.S. if you see some of the reports coming out, like Altria is reporting only a 2% decline this year versus what they thought would be a 4% decline in smoking. So I would say in some areas of the world that would appear people have more time in their hands and are using that time to smoke more, not less as kind of strange as that seems in this period. So we\u2019re not seeing any impact in demand, if anything, a little bit of an uptick. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks, guys. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Eric Petrie : Hey, Lori, it\u2019s Eric Petrie on for P.J. Lori Ryerkerk : Hi, Eric. Eric Petrie : In the Engineered Materials, can you discuss your project pipeline you were talking about moving from 4,000 last year to 5,000 this year? So is that on track? Or has that slowed down with lower auto builds? Lori Ryerkerk : No, I mean, actually, our Q2 is on track for in terms of project wins with what we expected, despite the COVID challenges. And I would say, even if you look at kind of value per win, which is where we\u2019re trying to focus this year, which is more on value, that\u2019s actually been flat year-over-year, which we think in the COVID environment is also good that we\u2019re getting good value out of our products. I would say, our Engineered Material folks are just doing a fantastic job being creative, finding ways to actually increase the amount of contact we have with our customers, even if it\u2019s remotely, being able to use a remote environment to get higher level contact with our customers. And using some really creative mechanisms like webinars to really not just touch existing customers, but also do prospecting for new customers. And so, we have found, customers still want solutions. We\u2019re still in the business of providing solutions. Our folks are really focused on that. And in addition to the ones we called out, we\u2019ve had several great examples of project wins in this quarter. I mean, just to maybe \u2013 just put a little color around it, in medical-grade POM, we had a pretty big win there for an auto injector application in Europe. We signed a development agreement with an app \u2013 for an application of our VitalDose EVA, which came up pretty good, upfront development fee. We have a new high voltage connector application for electric vehicles for our flame retardant nylon, which we also signed this quarter. And then we actually have quite a lot happening in the 5G space as folks are looking for better signal integrity, which is a great application for primarily LCP, but also PPS, and then for lightweighting applications, which is maybe more around LFT and other polymers. So, we\u2019re really excited about the wins that we\u2019re seeing in non-automotive space. But, of course, we call that we also had big wins this quarter in the automotive Tier 1 space as well. Eric Petrie : Great. Thank you for that insight. And then turning to the Acetyl Chain, we expect some volume improvement into third quarter, but no pricing. So is that just due to the raw materials you\u2019re expecting to remain benign from methanol and ethylene? Or could you talk a little bit about those raw material push on pricing versus a demand pull? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. The second quarter raw materials was, I would say, kind of at an all-time low, it was lower sequentially from Q1 across all areas. I mean, methanol was very low in all regions. I mean, we\u2019re seeing 20% declines in the U.S. and Asia in terms of pricing. Ethylene was very low with 15% declines in the U.S., 25% in Europe. Natural gas was low. I mean, everything was really low in Q2. As I said to an earlier question, we are seeing maybe some slight movement upward in terms of raw material and also acetic acid pricing in q3, but we saw that also in early Q2 and it didn\u2019t sustain. So, our assumption now for Q3 is, we may see some movements with pricing. We may see some movement with raws. They tend to move together. So we aren\u2019t really expecting much margin compression, but we\u2019re not expecting margin expansion either. So that\u2019s our assumption going forward. If we see sustainable movement, there may be an opportunity for margin expansion, but we\u2019ve not baked that into our numbers. Eric Petrie : Okay. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter. Lori, what do you think the Acetyl Chain can get back to, once maybe a post-COVID volume number or back to maybe a pre-COVID volume, if you can get back there at some point in time? And then \u2013 and what do you think needs to happen in terms of margins and pricing and to sort of get to that run rate? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Look, we still feel like kind of foundational level of earnings for the Acetyl Chain is in that $175 million to $200 million a quarter, so kind of that $700 million to $800 million per year. We feel pretty comfortable with that. I mean, even if you look at where we are right now in this quarter at, say, $116 million, we had an 11% volume loss due to COVID, if you remove the Elotex acquisition, which was 5%. So, that\u2019s about $40 million right there. And then we had another kind of $20 million in price margin, which I\u2019d say was tied to those really low volumes in utilization, particularly looking at VAM. So if you look at that, we\u2019re still in the \u2013 we still feel like we\u2019re in that $175 million to $200 million range, kind of without the extreme impacts that we saw from COVID on volume and then resulting \u2013 that resulting impact on margin. So I really think it just takes us back to getting to more normal levels of utilization. If you look at utilization this quarter, I mean, we \u2013 this is really the lowest of the trough conditions. If you look at China, China utilization was below 60%. Global utilization was only mid-60s. So I think really, to get back to that level of foundational earnings, we need to get back to the kind of 70% and higher level of utilization. And it\u2019s really about recovering Western Hemisphere demand, because that\u2019s really where we saw the weakness in second quarter. Michael Sison : Got it. And then when you think about 2021, you\u2019ve accelerated some turnarounds, you have some cost savings. How much sort of growth do you have somewhat in your control as you head into 2021 as sort of an anchor for some profitability improvement? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So as we move into 2021, we\u2019re really looking \u2013 if demand continues at the current trajectory, we\u2019re really, then in 2021, nearing the levels we saw in 2019. As you noticed earlier with my optimism about our project model in EM, I mean, we are having a lot of new project wins, new opportunities that we\u2019ve developed that we think in the EM space will let us, again, assuming the demand recovery continues, let us exceed the levels that we had in 2019 based upon the new projects that we\u2019re seeing being developed. So again, really around the EV space. Also elective surgery, we had a bit of a \u2013 almost, I\u2019d say, $10 million surprise this quarter from elective surgery deferral. I mean, we knew they were being pushed out, but we expected them to come back yet at the end of second quarter. We really haven\u2019t seen them come back. That was about a $10 million hit in the second quarter. Even in the third quarter, while we think elective surgeries come back, we aren\u2019t expecting much of that to come back in the third quarter, because there\u2019s some inventory that needs to be taken down at the \u2013 those suppliers. And so, that recovery really comes in fourth quarter and we think into 2021. So we think that will be an upside going into 2021, as well. Acetyl inventories are generally pretty low. So we think as we see demand recovery, that will pull-through to volume and margin in acetyl. And then as you said, we kind of have a $70 million to $80 million help next year from less turnaround. Michael Sison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Matthew DeYoe : Hi, thanks. So the last few EM deals targeted nylon compounding, but I\u2019m assuming that opportunities have been tapped out now. So where do you see future cash deployment headed from a polymer technology standpoint? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So have \u2013 we have targeted nylon. I mean, we put a lot of money into nylon acquisitions a few years ago. And so we\u2019ve really been working to kind of exploit that part of our portfolio and that new capability that was the rationale behind those acquisitions. And I think, quite frankly, there\u2019s a lot of runway left for us in nylon and especially in some of what we think are unique and good offerings we have around recycled nylon. So again, our ECOMID series, as well as our flame retardant nylon. So we actually think there\u2019s a lot of growth left in nylon with our existing assets, if you will. So as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to sell that as long as \u2013 as well as our other polymers as you think about M&A going forward, our capability going forward. I mean, clearly, there are some other polymers that, that may be of interest to us. We continue to look for ways to further expand our capability within some of the polymers that we have, as well as expand our reach maybe to polymers that are focused on other end-use sources or other geographies that we haven\u2019t penetrated as completely. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. And then you talked about the European compounding footprint consolidation you put out in the press release. That \u2013 maybe I missed it. But did you highlight any savings or synergies from that rationalization or optimization? Should we expect anything there? Or is it kind of like a\u2026? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, absolutely. I mean, it\u2019s a bit tied to your previous question. I mean, when we did a series of acquisitions over the last few years, we assumed a certain level of synergies associated with being able to optimize footprint, further improve our compounding capability and skills, as well as the polymers that we acquired. And so it usually does take us a few years to really get our handle on the business and what\u2019s happening and see where those opportunities are. So this announcement of the consolidation of facilities in Europe and establishing a clear compounding center of excellence at Forli, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s just really the natural progression from those acquisitions that we made a number of years ago. And so there\u2019s clearly productivity that comes with that, as well as we think improvement in development capability, customer support, supply chain optimization, et cetera. I would think of it in terms of \u2013 we typically only do projects that have greater than 20% returns. This one falls into that category and it will have a two to three-year payout. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. What\u2019s been the growth rate in medical applications in your Engineered Materials business so far this year? Lori Ryerkerk : And so, Jeff, I think that the medical applications has been relatively flat year-over-year with some growth in some applications, but clearly offset by the decline we\u2019ve seen this year in elective surgeries and what that has been. Again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term trend. I think, as we have in previous years, we will continue to see mid-digit growth year-on-year in medical. But I think \u2013 so I think this is just a timing impact in terms of electric \u2013 elective surgery. But because of that change in elective surgery this year, I would say, relatively flat year-to-year. Jeffrey Zekauskas : You have a relatively mild volume forecast in Acetyl Chain for the third quarter relative to the second quarter. Is that because of Celanese\u2019s own, either restructuring activities or plant turnarounds? Or does it have to do with the rate of the growth of the acetyl industry itself? Maybe you could talk about the growth of the industry in the second quarter versus the growth of the industry in the third quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I mean, we did see some good recovery in volumes quarter one to quarter two, as we saw Asia really coming back earlier. But we saw a lot of decline, obviously, in the Western Hemisphere in quarter two. Now, as we move into quarter three, we do expect, as like I said, modest volume growth in the Western Hemisphere. But we are being probably a bit conservative here in terms of what we think volume growth will be in the third quarter, just based on what we\u2019re seeing is the trend so far. Scott Richardson : Yes, Jeff, if you look at Q2 on a year-over-year basis, we were down somewhere in the 20% range. If you look at Q3 year-over-year, that\u2019s probably more like 10% to 15%. So that modest increase driven by some slight recovery in the Western Hemisphere. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. If I look at your Acetate Tow earnings in the first-half of the year, your equity earnings from the JVs in China are up double digits in percentage terms, while the consolidated sales are down, looks like 22% or so. And so my question is that, that seems a lot more pronounced than the underlying demographics. Has that mix shift been more acute for Celanese for some reason? If so, why is that the case? And do you expect it to continue? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, Kevin, I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 there was a one-time event. We had a large contract, which came off at the end of 2019, which actually shifted volume to our affiliate and took it out of our own earnings. And so that \u2013 you\u2019re seeing that shift, that was something that was planned. We\u2019ve called it out in past quarters. So it really is that shift into affiliate of volume coming from our affiliate versus coming from, if you will, Celanese production. Scott Richardson : Yes. Kevin, if you even go back to our Investor Day in 2018, we telegraphed this that this would be coming. Kevin McCarthy : Understood. Thank you for that. And then second question relates to your acetyls business in Asia. In the prepared remarks last night, you referenced the expansion of some supply deals in Nanjing, as well as Singapore. And so maybe a two-parter. Was there any benefit associated with that in the second quarter? And then longer-term, does that have any bearing on your flexibility to rationalize assets in Asia if and when you eventually proceed with the expansions that you had planned in the United States? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. And so, look, I mean, these are contracts that have come up in a normal way for renewal. I mean, we\u2019ve been happy renegotiating them in this environment that we\u2019ve been able to get some additional productivity working with our supply partners. And so, we\u2019re happy about the security of supply this gives us in both Nanjing and Singapore going forward, as well as some additional flexibility we get in these locations going forward, that to really help us better manage our Acetyl Chain. So there will be some productivity out of both of those contracts going forward. Most of that, though, will occur in future years in 2021 and beyond. Scott Richardson : And it does not limit our flexibility, Kevin, to continue with our reconfiguration project in Clear Lake when we start that back up again. Kevin McCarthy : Very good. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your questions. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Quick question around the Acetyl Chain and the interplay between product pricing and raw material pricing. I mean, if I remember correctly, historically, you guys talked about raw material volatility actually being a favorable environment \u2013 being favorable for that business line, right? And if we take a look like you rightly said, through the course of the first-half of the year, ethylene pricing came under tremendous pressure, methanol pricing came under tremendous downside pressure, and everything was kind of going down in a straight line. And now, we\u2019ve seen some buoyancy in ethylene, some buoyancy in methanol, but there are enough sort of industry folks out there that expect that buoyancy to be short-lived. So the question really is, are you expecting raw material buoyancy going forward? And would that not be a favorable environment for the AC business? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, look, we have been a very low raw material pricing. I mean, we\u2019ve been very low oil tends to draw low raws. And normally, when we see low oil, low raws, we actually expect some margin compression in acetyls. We\u2019re actually \u2013 we\u2019re very pleased in Q2, that is a really great work by our folks in the Acetyl Chain and constantly pushing the envelope around activations and movement of products into \u2013 with \u2013 throughout the terrain and throughout the geographies that we were able to maintain our variable margins and not have any compression. Usually, when we see raws going up, we would expect some margin expansion. But I think, the way you characterize it is correct. We \u2013 there is some buoyancy, but we are not convinced that, that will remain. Again, we saw the same buoyancy at the beginning of Q2, but then saw raw materials go to some of the lowest that we\u2019ve experienced in a decade. So although, we\u2019re seeing some buoyancy at the beginning of Q3, we don\u2019t still see any fundamentals that would lead us to believe that, that is sustainable for the quarter. Scott Richardson : And that buoyancy we like, Hassan, as you mentioned, I mean, that up and down allows us to \u2013 we will flex our assets that are based upon different raw materials and different feedstocks in different regions. And just that uniqueness of the model in acetyls that up and down that volatility, we tend to be able to make margins on. Hassan Ahmed : Very clear. And as a follow-up, again, sticking to the Acetyl Chain, recently, we obviously saw a large incumbent exit that business, and I guess, a new entrant will eventually be coming in. And one of the reasons cited for the exit was that the company talked about how they had kind of underinvested in that business over the years and they wanted to focus on their core business. How are you guys thinking about the evolution of the market with, I guess, that large incumbent leaving, new entrants coming in and some of the statements coming out as reasons behind that exit? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, INEOS is an experienced player in the business. We don\u2019t see any meaningful change in terms of the industry dynamics or competitiveness of the industry within INEOS replacing BP. So we don\u2019t see any change. Look, I think, there\u2019s a lot of reasons that transaction took place. I think, INEOS will be a good steward of the business. And while they have an interest in expansion, I also don\u2019t believe that these margins, anybody is going to be interested in investing in these businesses at this level of margin. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thanks so much, Lori. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, good morning, everyone. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning, Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes. So, Lori, I just wanted to follow-up on some of your recent comments. Just kind of stepping back over the last three years, in particular, the Acetyl Chain has been very opportunistic in kind of flexing its global network and optimizing margins along the chain of molecules. I guess, the question is, are opportunities going to be as plentiful in a diminished sort of global demand growth scenario, where there\u2019s considerable excess capacity as you pointed out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, we \u2013 as we\u2019ve said before, I mean, we really think our acetyl model is unique. It\u2019s unique in the breadth of the portfolio in terms of going all the way from methanol, in a way now to redispersible powders. And it\u2019s unique in the fact that we have three very distinct routes from raw materials to end-use products that move in different geographies, and that gives us a lot of optionality that others in the industry just can\u2019t replicate. And so we think that opportunity continues through every scenario going forward. Look, acetyls will tend to grow at the rate of GDP. We tended to maybe even outpace that a little bit, given the optionality, given our focus on end-use customers and some of the derivatives in the Acetyl Chain. So I don\u2019t see that changing going forward. We think acetyl continues to be a high-margin business, maybe considered a commodity product, but we do not operate it in a commodity way. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just kind of thinking through the past few months, I mean, obviously, the pandemic has impacted each of the major regions differently. Just looking through the lens of Celanese, are the western regions recovering in line with maybe what you experienced in China? Or is it still too early to tell? Lori Ryerkerk : I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell. I mean, China has had a fast recovery within China. I would say, what has not fully recovered yet in China is exports from China. And you may recall last quarter, we called out one of the things we\u2019re looking for on recovery is when do China exports get back to previous levels? Because that\u2019s a good indication of Western Hemisphere recovery. So starting to see some exports, again, but clearly not up to full level. I think, the U.S., we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we saw pretty good signs of recovery, especially in auto. How Sustainable that is? I think, we\u2019ll have to see what happens with COVID. And do we \u2013 due we see the economy continue to open up? Do we see it start to contract again? I mean, that\u2019s our concern going forward. I think Europe has been a little more sluggish initially, but seems to be coming out of COVID a bit stronger. So maybe we see that continuing. So I think it is very mixed by region, both at the pace and also both about the certainty in the future. And I think we continue to watch the same things. We\u2019re looking for signs of Western Hemisphere recovery, a lot of which can be measured by what our exports doing in China. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. Thanks so much. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Ghansham. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Just in Engineered Materials, why were volume down in June? And how are they trending year-over-year in July? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I would say, June volumes were up \u2013 actually up from May and July is up from June and August is trending pretty consistently with July. At this point, we don\u2019t really have any visibility at this point on September. But steady monthly good progression from May through July. Scott Richardson : Yes. And David, for the quarter in Q3, we\u2019re kind of looking at 10% to 15% down year-over-year, if that\u2019s helpful. And it\u2019s a little different. Typically, August, we would see volumes come down versus July. We\u2019re not seeing that dip in the order book, just given the differences that we\u2019re seeing this year. David Begleiter : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And just Lori, you mentioned Ibn Sina having the big earnings decline in Q2 due to the low oil prices. They\u2019ve come back a little bit. So how do you think about Ibn Sina earnings in the back-half the year a little bit higher oil price? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we \u2013 look, we did see Ibn Sina come down in second quarter due to low oil prices, again, Ibn Sina has the quarter delay. So that\u2019s low oil prices in Q1. Obviously, those low oil prices continued in Q2, which we will now see show up in our Q3 earnings. And then Q4, who knows hopefully a bit back up as we start to see oil going up again. David Begleiter : Very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with \u2013 excuse me, Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. I appreciate some of the commentary with respect to the second quarter and the third quarter. I was wondering if I could get a little more granular in terms of the monthly progression that you saw through the second quarter and how has July actually been coming in, in terms of your volumes? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I mean, for both EM and for acetyls, I would say, we \u2013 the same trend is true. I mean, we definitely saw July being stronger than June and we\u2019re seeing August coming in pretty consistent with July, both in terms of volume and margin. Frank Mitsch : And the fact that August is coming in consistent with July would be more positive than you\u2019ve seen in prior years. Is that correct? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. No, that\u2019s correct, because usually, we see the impact, especially in Europe of extended vacation periods. And we are anecdotally hearing some workplaces in Europe are not shutting down in August, like they typically do, because they\u2019ve already been down for so long. And so we think that\u2019s pulling through in a bit more strength in August than we typically see. Frank Mitsch : Very helpful. And you suggested that the industry operating rates in the second quarter for acetic acid were in the mid-60s and VAM was in the mid-70s during the second quarter. Where are those numbers now? Lori Ryerkerk : They aren\u2019t significantly moved from Q2 in terms of overall global operating rates. Frank Mitsch : Thanks so much. Lori Ryerkerk : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious, you talked previously about the opportunity for about $0.50 from productivity/supply chain investments, as well as $0.50 from buybacks. Could you just update us on the possibility of realizing that over the next year-and-a-half or so? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I \u2013 I\u2019m completely confident in our ability to achieve the $0.50 from productivity. Year-to-date, we\u2019re at $135 million of productivity that \u2013 so two-thirds of the way already to the $200 million target that was associated with that 50% \u2013 that $0.50. So feel very confident we\u2019ll get that $200 million. Just to put it in perspective where that comes from, so about a third of that productivity comes from optimization of our footprint and other manufacturing optimizations; about a third comes from raw material and logistic productivity and then about a third form revenue optimization, SG&A and kind of everything else. So given that it\u2019s a very balanced way we get productivity. I feel completely comfortable we\u2019ll achieve at least that $200 million target. And you might recall, we also have another $30 million to $40 million of one-time cost saving in 2020 that we expect to get this year, which will be even a bit more help. So, things like travel reduction and additional manufacturing savings associated with slowdowns, the shutdowns and corporate functions, et cetera. So, I feel very comfortable at $0.50. I mean, the $0.50 share buybacks, clearly, our balance sheet is in a good position right now. And so we feel like that\u2019s certainly achievable. But let me hand it to Scott. Scott Richardson : Yes. So Arun, we did a little over $100 million in the first part of the year, which will get us some of that. We announced $500 million as part of the Polyplastics deal, which will make that an accretive transaction. So we\u2019ll get a little bit more from that. And then you\u2019ve got the balance of the $800 million from that deal that will be deployed, either through M&A or additional repurchases into next year. So between all of that, we should exceed that $0.50 that we had originally called out as we get into the middle part of next year. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks. And maybe you could just get your perspective on acetic and VAM pricing as you go through the rest of this year and maybe even to next year. I mean, is it fair to assume that there\u2019s going to be limited opportunity there, just given low operating rates and maybe methanol remaining relatively low as well? Are you looking at kind of overall pricing opportunities in the AC Chain? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, I think if we look at the entirety of the AC Chain, I think, pricing will tend to move with raws. I think, we won\u2019t see a lot of margin compression, but I\u2019m not sure given the low capacity utilization will also see a lot of opportunity for margin expansion. And so while we may see pricing go up, I don\u2019t \u2013 as raws \u2013 if raws go up, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a lot of additional margin there. I think there\u2019s probably a little more opportunity in VAM and downstream of acetic acid, as those tend to have slightly higher utilizations already. And especially now as we move \u2013 remain in a strong construction season through Q3. There may continue to be some opportunities there on pricing. But again, as we move into Q4, that tends to fall off a bit. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, great. Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from William Blair with Tudor, Pickering Holt. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Blair : Hey, Lori, it\u2019s Matthew Blair with TPH. I was wondering how you\u2019re thinking about free cash flow targets for 2020? At one point, you\u2019re aiming for about $900 million, then COVID hit, but you\u2019re still at $418 million year-to-date. You\u2019ve also outlined the extra $400 million of tailwinds from things like productivity and lower CapEx. So do you think something like I don\u2019t know $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2020 is is a good range? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, we\u2019ve previously \u2013 before COVID, we were looking at a range of $800 million to $900 million of free cash flow. As we went into COVID, we\u2019ve obviously clearly been fixated on free cash flow and making sure we take steps to try to preserve free cash flow. We did identify that $400 million that you referenced have additional steps we can take on free cash flow. But again, we\u2019ve also had a pretty large EBIT decline associated with COVID volumes and margins. So we still think we\u2019re \u2013 that given our strong first-half performance that we will be north of the $800 million mark on free cash flow that we had laid out earlier. Matthew Blair : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then the release noted that turnaround costs in 2021 would be meaningfully lower. Can you share any numbers around that? And in particular, any details by segment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So on turnaround, we will be meaningfully lower in 2021. If you look at where we are earlier this year, again, pre-COVID, we thought turnarounds were in this $70 million to $80 million for 2020. We\u2019ve now pulled in the Frankfurt POM, which is $20 million to $30 million. So, this year, our outlook \u2013 total outlook for turnarounds will be in the $90 million to $110 million range. In 2021, that goes back to $20 million to $30 million. And I would \u2013 that $20 million to $30 million is pretty evenly split between EM and AC. Matthew Blair : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bhavesh Lodaya : Hi, good morning, Lori. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Lori Ryerkerk : Hi. Bhavesh Lodaya : So first, on your commentary for the third quarter. So it looks like, obviously, sequentially, EM is expected to see strong growth and then the rest of the segments will be more balanced with their own pluses and minuses. So if we add the $60 million of EBIT or so to the EM and keep the rest unchanged from sequential 2Q levels, we are looking at, call it, $260 million of EBIT for the next quarter. So the question is, is as straightforward as that? Or obviously, any macro surprises could impact that? But are there any other moving pieces, which can cause this target to move materially? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we are really suggesting for Q3, the recovery will be in EM. We expect to recover about 50% of the decline we saw Q1 to Q2, we expect to recover going back into Q3. We also get some help from not having a batch of turnaround in Q3, but that\u2019s offset by some further decline in Ibn Sina. And again, in AC and Tow, we expect them to be relatively flat with Q2 performance. Bhavesh Lodaya : Got it. And then if we move to the 2021 comment, so you mentioned that you expect demand growth for 2021 to be beyond 2019 levels. Is the implication that you could see higher earnings as well in 2021 versus 2019 levels? Or does pricing and other headwinds remain kind of like the bigger unknowns? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I think for \u2013 we expect for AC demand levels probably similar to 2019. For EM, we would expect, assuming the demand trajectory continues level similar to 2019 with maybe some upside due to the project wins that we are having this year and fairly robust sectors like EV, like 5G, like medical, that we think may give us some upside next year versus 2019. Scott Richardson : Yes, Bhavesh, I think the timing of when we see the full recovery will be \u2013 will kind of determine exactly where the overall annual earnings end up. If we finish this year and start next year at demand level similar to 2019 at the beginning of the year, then, yes, I think that, that\u2019s a decent assumption. However, if we see things still kind of ramping back to those levels as we begin the year, you may not get to that level until somewhere in the middle part of the year. So there\u2019s just a level of visibility we have still to where we\u2019ll see that recovery and when we\u2019ll see it get back to those levels is still a little bit uncertain. Bhavesh Lodaya : Got it. Got it. Thanks, Lori and Scott. Abe Paul : Hey, Jesse, we\u2019ll go ahead and make the next question, the last one for the call. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jim Sheehan with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. James Sheehan : Good morning. Thank you. Can you comment on acetic acid inventory levels in China? And also, the reports of high water levels on the Yangtze River impacting shipments from Nanjing. Are you seeing any shipment delays because of this? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, inventory levels, generally, globally are reasonably low for acetic acid. I mean, there has been some build in other products made from acetic acid in China associated with the lack of exports. So we have yet to see how that play out. I will say on the Yangtze, we have not seen any impact at all to our operations associated with high water levels or otherwise. We\u2019ve not had any supply chain problems. James Sheehan : Thanks. And can you comment on political proposals to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28%? How much impact might that have on your effective tax rate? Lori Ryerkerk : Scott? Scott Richardson : Yes. Jim, we\u2019re still working through those. And I think, it\u2019s really too early to say. Obviously, we have a pretty global network. And so you won\u2019t see it straight flow through to all of our earnings. So we will \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to look at that and a lot would depend upon where demand levels are broadly from a global perspective. James Sheehan : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I\u2019ll turn the floor back over to Mr. Paul for any additional closing comments. Abe Paul : All right. Thank you, Jesse. We thank you for your questions and listening in today. As usual, we\u2019re available after the call for any further questions you might have. Jesse, feel free to close out the call at this time. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Once again, we thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Brandon Ayache, Senior Director Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Doug. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Senior Director of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open the line directly for your questions. Doug please go ahead and open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question. John. Roberts: Thank you. I would have thought that a lot of plastics inventory would have been left in the supply chain when the auto plants and other manufacturers shut down earlier in the year. So, I would have thought that Celanese would have lagged the recovery of the customers, but it seems like you've been pretty coincident. Maybe you could comment a little bit on timing issue. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, thanks for the question John. I think what is clear to us as we were saying throughout 2019; we were seeing a lot of destocking in the auto chain. And so we went into 2020 with much lower inventories in our estimation than is typical in the entirety of that chain. And as we went through the first quarter auto was still running well certainly in the Western Hemisphere. And so we really have not seen any buildup during the time we were down and we've seen really steady demand consistent with or even actually a bit better than you've seen auto builds recover. So, I think what's different this time than maybe in past recessions or past downturn is just the fact that we had gone through a pretty significant period of destocking already in 2019. John. Roberts: And then could you provide a little more granularity in your comment about rising raw materials? And is that causing you to activate your network any differently? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, the real impact in third quarter from rising raw material was ethylene pricing. So, we really saw ethylene pricing up throughout the entirety of the third quarter really in all regions of the world. I wouldn't say it's had a real difference in terms of our acetyl chain in terms of our activation. We really haven't seen that pass through to our Engineered Materials. It's not been an impact there really being a long supply chain in EM. But we did see the impact as you noted from our comments in the third quarter especially in acetyls. It really -- we also saw some increases in methanol and CO at the end of the quarter. And some of those increases we weren't able to pass through in pricing in third quarter, but would expect to be able to mitigate in fourth quarter. John. Roberts: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Bob Koort : Thank you. Good morning. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning. Bob Koort : Lori I think not too long ago you stopped talking about discrete project wins in EM. I'm just wondering if you could give us some sense of what you might expect as we look into 2021 versus 2020, will it be sort of a bit parity? Could it be better? Is there a chance it could be actually lower? How do you see those new project applications developing? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, we really stopped talking a lot about project wins just recognizing that not all projects are created equal. And just because we had a lot of wins doesn't mean we were necessarily creating more value. But it is something we still try. I would tell you in the third quarter, we were well on target with the number of wins that we expected to have as well as with the margin expectations from those projects. So, as we go into 2021 I actually continue to expect to see the number of project wins going up. We've managed to build a lot in the pipeline do some really good work by our commercial teams working virtually and using new formats for us like webinars and that sort of thing. And so we're seeing the number of projects actually continue to go up as well as the value of projects continuing to build pretty significantly. I mean maybe just a few examples of wins we've had during COVID and more recently. So, as a result of one of our webinars we recently did one on electric vehicle batteries. We had over 200 customers a lot have attended that series of webinars across the region. And as a result of all the work being done during COVID, we've also had some really good placements so not just EVs which are booming, but also we've had a big contract for LCT into one of the leading electronics manufacturers which goes into smartphones and tablets and headphones. So our commercial folks are doing a great job continuing to find those areas of growth, continuing to find those areas where our unique technologies can really be applied at meaningful margins. And we -- it feels very good for us going into 2021 with some of the wins we've had this year and have teed up for next year. Bob Koort : And can I ask you -- you started doing your share repurchase before the proceeds came in. Was that just a function of expecting the world to heal and so it was a good time to start buying? And then do you have a pretty short list of ways, Scott can spend that money on M&A next year? Or is it still somewhat of a murky environment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I think in terms of share repurchases yes, we did start prior to the actual close because obviously we could see the close was in sight. So we wanted to go ahead and get in the market and start those share repurchases and spread them out over a longer period of time. As a result of that clearly we're in really good financial shape. We've been quite active looking at M&A. On the positive side, we've had most of our management team together now since June. So we've been able to use that to really reset our sights on M&A do a broader look at M&A targets. I would say we have not a short list but a pretty well-defined list of those things that we're interested in both from a bolt-on standpoint as well from a larger more transformational M&A standpoint. We do see the market starting to get better as people stock prices are improving. The discussions can get more serious. People are I guess feeling better about getting value for their assets. So the discussions are ongoing, but as we all know this takes some time. So I think yes it's probably well into 2021 before we'd be able to action anything. Bob Koort : Great, thanks very much. Lori Ryerkerk : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. First question is just kind of around the level of business today and when we think about that going into 2021. So if the world doesn't get better from here your Q1, EBITDA was down about 15% year-over-year; this quarter was down about 17%. Does the world feel about the same as it did in Q1 and that would be flat at this level of economic activity in Q1 next year to start out? Or how would you gauge that economic level today and what we should use that to model into 2021 for you guys? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So let me just start. If we look at fourth quarter, we actually see our volumes and pricing being up in fourth quarter on kind of the base materials. But we still do expect that December seasonality. So in acetyls maybe seasonality is happening today. If we look at snow happening in some of the western and northern states in acetyls, we typically see some drop-off in demand for emulsions and VAM and powders as we see a slowdown in the construction industry due to weather. And in Engineered Materials, we typically see not so much of a volume drop but more of a margin mix effect as we see Western Hemisphere companies take time off over the holidays. That volume is usually replaced by a pickup in China and Asia, but usually a slightly lower margin. So we still expect some seasonality in Q4, but on a growing base if you will of increased volume and pricing. As we look to 2021, look we have a lot of uncertainty right now with COVID. Our expectation is that 2021, we will continue to see growth and recovery back to 2019 level some time in 2021, so continued recovery out of 2020. The reason we provided the guidance we did is, we don't know exactly what that looks like. And given all the uncertainties around COVID in the world today, it's kind of hard to call that. So that's why we called out our controllable actions the things that we know will add $1.25 EPS over today's earnings. So if you took your expected earnings for 2020 at $1.25 I'd say that's pretty much the floor of what we'd expect next year. Maybe to put it in perspective, if you assume Q3 demand levels would persist for all of 2021 that adds kind of another $1 on top of that for volume growth and price growth. So we are expecting a more positive 2021. But again, just uncertainties around COVID right now, what that might happen as we see it going on in Europe in the U.S. we just haven't really put out a definitive outlook for 2021. Duffy Fischer : No. That's very helpful on that dollar comment. And then could you also line out what losing Polyplastic does as we anniversary that over the next three quarters? And is there anything else discrete like Polyplastic that we should think about taking out of 2021 when we go forward? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think the discrete things, Polyplastics call it roughly $10 million a quarter comes out starting now in the fourth quarter. So that needs to be taken into place. And then I think the really discrete things are what we called out in the earnings. So kind of $0.25 for productivity -- net productivity into next year; $0.50 for lower turnaround expense into next year that is for certain; and then another $0.50 for share repurchases half of that being for the repurchases we did in 2020 offset by Polyplastics and the other half being for share repurchases we plan to do in 2021. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. I think year-to-date other activities in terms of EBITDA is maybe a benefit of about $46 million. And at least on an operating EBITDA basis, I think it was about $30 million in the quarter. Can you talk about what's behind those trends whether they will continue and whether your pension revaluation in the fourth quarter will be larger than it was last year? Scott Richardson : Yes, Jeff. The biggest chunk of the year-over-year other activities is that pension income component which is in the neighborhood of between $25 million and $30 million of benefit year-over-year. So that's the largest benefit. You have seen a little bit of movement up and down in other from quarter-to-quarter this year, particularly kind of hitting the low point here in the third quarter largely driven by timing of some compensation and benefits payments. We'll see a little bit of an uptick think about Q4 being slightly higher than Q2 was as we finish out the year. And part of it is just timing of when some of the stuff has come through.  So in the end, as we look forward into next year, we expect a slight uptick in underlying expenses and that will more than likely be offset by the Q4 pension adjustment. I mean, a lot is going to depend upon what happens with markets. We expect interest rates right now to hold relatively low. And if things stay where they are then we'll have a slight benefit in pension income next year, which as I said will probably be offset by some income or some expense increases. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then in terms of your share repurchase, it sounds like you're going to execute it regardless of the Celanese price. Is that true? That is it doesn't matter whether it's at 100 or 120, you're going to spend the $500 million you've allocated this year and I guess a similar amount for next year. Is that fair? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, yes, I think it's fair. I think the $500 million this year that we have -- or what we have remaining this year is really to remain accretive on our Polyplastics sale. So that will continue. And I would say for next year, the $400 million to $500 million we've allocated for next year is really the balance of cash flow following, CapEx following dividend payments. And Scott may want to comment further, but we generally like to remain in the market on a fairly steady basis regardless of the price and we don't really see that changing as we go into next year. Scott Richardson : Yes, Jeff, consistency has been exactly how we've operated when it comes to repurchases over the year. We have been opportunistic from time-to-time, but we like to have kind of a set level that we remain in the market. And that's what we plan to do here in Q4 as well as into next year based on -- with those levels that we outlined. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. On the elective surgery comments in Engineered Materials, I mean it sounds like this is a deferral not a destruction of demand and it's just a question of when folks are going to get back and do those procedures. But I just wanted to kind of understand the cadence of the destocking. I might have guessed it would happen more in 2Q versus 3Q and it obviously caused a big mix disruption.  And so maybe you can just bridge that with is this just something that once there's a vaccine those people are going to get back and have their hips or their knees or what have you done? And how far in advance do your customers then need to rebuild the inventory that they're taking out now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Great question, Vincent. What we really saw in 2Q were no elective procedures happening. And I think if you read Johnson & Johnson or anybody's release that would back that up. I mean just no elective surgery was happening in 2Q. So basically in second quarter everybody was sitting there with the inventories they had at the sudden shutdown in March of all elective surgeries across the U.S. which is the primary market this goes into.  And so we have seen in third quarter that elective surgeries are starting to rehappen. But what we're also hearing from our customers is people are using that inventory they've had sitting on the shelf waiting to see how fast this all comes back before starting to reorder.  Look it's not a long we carry inventory so it's not a long supply chain. They know we have it available. We are starting to see some slight uptick again in fourth quarter. So we fully expect this volume to come back across 2021 and 2022. I think it's not just the hospital being open. But again, these are generally older patients getting this. So it's also people being comfortable, either because there's a vaccine, or because they feel the virus is under control that people feel comfortable to go back to the hospital again to have these procedures. Vincent Andrews : And then, if I could just follow up on the comments about manufacturing facilities fully staffed and operating to meet improved demand. Maybe more specifically in acetyl, what rates are you operating at in each region? As I recall, there was some an asset down in Europe and maybe some lower utilizations in Asia. So, just maybe a check-in on where those are would be helpful. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I would say for acetyls, I mean, all of our facilities are back up and running. We do have a short turnaround in Clear Lake. Actually that we're in at the moment. We had a short downtime in Singapore. So, a number of small maintenance downtimes that were planned into the numbers. But really, everything is up and running. All of our staff is back at full force. I would say, certainly for derivatives things are pretty much running at 100% to meet the demand. And in acid, we're running to meet demand as well. So we are fully staffed, fully ready to go and actually have seen for the last several months, the demand there is pretty much runs full. As we pointed out, I mean, for acetyls, we are just slightly under 2019 volumes already at this point in time. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Very good. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Mike Sison : Hey. Good afternoon. Nice quarter. Lori, when you think about that dollar upside for 2021 does that assume that, the Acetyl Chain sort of the trends you're seeing now pricing at $300 and sort of the optionality focus downstream to emulsion and powders would stay in that range for that dollar? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I was really just sorting that out as an example Mark -- Mike, sorry, as the range that we would expect to see. So, third quarter kind of being our best quarter this year, if we saw that continued next year that would get you the dollar. There are many multiples of the ways to get there. I would say though, as we look to 2021, I mean, we are seeing an uptick in asset prices in China. Today, up closer to kind of the mid $300 mark up from the $300 per ton we were at in third quarter. So clearly that's an upside in acetyls. As I said, we're already getting close to 2019 volumes in acetyls. The story there is really, when do we see utilization get tight enough we start to see some price recovery, which we think we're starting to see now. Again, some seasonality expected in derivatives in December, but we would expect that that's come back in January. Scott Richardson : Yes, Mike, I think just to add. I think what's really important as we think about that is really contribution margin. And so we may see pricing move up as raw materials move up. So we've seen a lot of our fundamental raws increase here over the last two or three months. And if that were to hold these prices hold, so we really look at contribution margin. So you kind of -- the current conditions were to continue as Lori mentioned in the third quarter and what we're seeing here in the fourth quarter that dollar is the level you'd see. Mike Sison : Understood. And then, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about $400 million or so to be used for organic growth. Can you maybe talk about some of the areas that you're going to invest in to do -- to drive some growth for the next couple of years? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we're predicting $400 million to $415 million of CapEx for next year. We're still finalizing that number, but I feel comfortable we should be well north of $400 million. It is to support organic growth as well as our run and maintain level of maintenance, which we typically have in there at around $150 million to $175 million. So, included in that number is the restart of the acetic acid expansion at Clear Lake. That happens at the end of 2021. It seems like the Bishop GUR. We've previously announced some expansion in our VAE and VAM facilities around the globe. So that number is built in there as well. So a lot of things that you've already heard about, but just really seeing them start hitting heavier capital next year. Scott Richardson : Yes. And our teams are pushing hard on cost reduction capital as well Mike. And so, we're working to accelerate projects as we talked about earlier this year. And so embedded in that number is capital needed for some of the productivity gains that we called out in the prepared remarks. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good afternoon, Lori. Sorry to bore you guys, but another question about the 2021 guide. I know you guys had said that, obviously as the EPS stands right now Q3 was the strongest quarter. But as I take a look at Q4 guidance the midpoint call it slightly north of $1.50. And then I sort of think about, the one-offs seasonality as well some of the turnarounds you come up with a number recurring, which is north of $2, right? So I'm just trying to understand, or get a better sense of run rate sort of EPS as one thinks about 2021. So I mean it seems barring those one-offs, one is already north of $2 and then you have $0.25 worth of productivity another $0.50 worth of buybacks. So it seems without much improvement from Q4 levels, one could hit maybe $9 in 2021. Am I thinking about this the right way? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes I think that's right. If you look at where we are, we guided to in the year somewhere $7 or slightly above $7. If you add on the $1.25, that is based on controllable actions that we outlined in the comments that gets you to $8.25 plus maybe a little bit more. And then if you consider some level of recovery against, as if it were Q3 for the year, you can quickly then get yourself to $9 or a bit north of $9 next year. Again, our big caveat on that is just seeing the resurgence of COVID and not knowing what that's going to do to market in Q4 and into next year. That's why we haven't called out a specific level of recovery. Hassan Ahmed : Of course, of course. Makes complete sense. And as a follow-up, you pointed out a $5 million sequential hit from Ibn Sina. Now, if I recall correctly, there tends to be a quarter's lag between what oil prices do and the impact of that being felt in your results in Ibn Sina. So is it fair to assume that Ibn Sina could be somewhat of a tailwind come Q4? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So Ibn Sina is a quarter lag. So if you look at methanol prices they were very low levels in Q2. That's the additional $5 million sequential hit we saw this quarter from Ibn Sina. Now with methanol prices recovering, we would expect to recover that $5 million from Ibn Sina in fourth quarter. Hassan Ahmed : Got it. Scott Richardson : But you won't see it flow through Hassan on the equity earnings line because it will be offset by the roughly $10 million or so that comes out from Polyplastics. So we just look at those two together down $5 million Q3 to Q4. Hassan Ahmed : Hassan Ahmed : Absolutely. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Lori Ryerkerk : Hi, P.J. P.J. Juvekar: A question about your BlueRidge Cellulosic plastic. I think that's biodegradable plastic for food takeout, et cetera. How big is that market? And how much polyethylene or PET can you replace with cellulosics? And how do you price it? Do you charge a premium over let's say PE? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, let me describe it this way. The accessible market for this material could be huge. The reason we went ahead and made the marketing announcement is we're at that point now we need to get material out to customers. We need to give them the chance to try it out. It is a more costly product than PE. That's why this hasn't really been a factor in the market today. But we also know that there are customers out there who are looking for a sustainable biodegradable solution who are less sensitive to the price point. But that's what we really -- that's why we made the announcement. We really are in the process of getting material out to customers. We've had a few small purchase agreements made for people who are going through trials. But we need more time frankly to find out what the price point is on this and what the demand is really for replacement of more traditional PE products. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. And then secondly, as you bring more of your acetyls production in the U.S., you are more exposed to natural gas prices here. And maybe Scott you can comment about, are you concerned about rising natural gas prices because of lower associated gas production? And are you hedging any part of your natural gas purchases? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So look we don't expect rising natural gas prices to have a really material impact on our business. It does have the potential to slightly compress margins. But this is the value of our global network. The fact that we can choose where to make the acetic acid where to sell it, we can flex our production levels, we can flex further down into derivatives, which are less raw material sensitive. So we really are not expecting any material impact from this in the fourth quarter. Scott Richardson : Yes P.J., we do take some short-term positions from time to time but nothing that I would say is long term in nature if you will. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Matthew DeYoe : Hi. So perhaps this isn't the case in EVs, but has COVID slowed the pace of innovation at CE or at the customers at all? I would think just given restrictions around staffing and R&D labs, you may just have a slowdown in the pace and implementation of new business? Lori Ryerkerk : So great question, Matt. I would say, look, when we first went into COVID I mean certainly it had an impact as one I think people thought this was not a long-term thing and so things were just put on hold for a short period of time. I would say all of our customers and ourselves included have now adjusted to the new world of COVID. And if anything we see the pace of innovation pick up. Again most of our folks are back in office and facility, so we've been able to do a lot of things for our customers. We also see our customers coming back and we also see them getting more comfortable with doing more remotely. So, again, going back to my previous answer on wins we are still seeing projects win. We are seeing high-value project wins and we feel very excited about the pipeline of wins in Engineered Materials for next year and the innovation that's gone into that. It really was helpful for us that at the end of 2019, we really focused our strategy on what we considered a few emerging trends around 5G and electric vehicles and medical and pharma and sustainable solution. And that focus on that innovation and keeping that pipeline strong through COVID is really helping us now as we move into recovery and we see those areas continuing to emerge as winning sectors. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. And maybe on the same light how long is it going to take you to fill out the new GUR capacity? And what EBITDA contribution of an expansion what would that look like? Because most of this is going to EV batteries too, maybe if you can provide a little bit more color there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, the expansion that we announced in Bishop the 15 kt expansion should be online early 2022. It is really supplying our global network for electric vehicles. And at the current rate of growth in electric vehicles about 25% a year quite frankly that will be sold out the day it starts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Lori just on 2021, you highlighted a number of tailwinds for next year. Are there any headwinds we should be thinking about for next year from a bridge standpoint? Lori Ryerkerk : No, not really David. I mean for us the headwind is -- does something happen to the economy because of a reemergence of COVID and that's why we haven't called out any specific projections for us in terms of volume and price growth. But no we intentionally pulled a lot forward into 2020 this year in terms of facility changes inventory draws all of those things to take advantage of the low-demand environment. So, we really don't see any major headwinds going into next year. David Begleiter : And just on EV, Lori where are your sales today for EV-related content? And where can they be do you think in three to five years? Lori Ryerkerk : David, I don't think I have an exact number. I mean I would say GUR has other applications besides EV. EV is certainly the fastest growing of those applications. And we expect electric vehicles -- the market for electric vehicles of which we are a pretty significant player in the lithium-ion battery separators to grow at about 25% per year for the next five years. Scott Richardson : Yes, it's a tough question David because there's a lot of applications where we have content on a vehicle that it doesn't matter if it's an ICE vehicle or if it's an EV vehicle. So, sometimes it's hard for us to partial that out. If we look at EV-specific applications, it's very low single-digits of the percentage of EM's revenue today. David Begleiter : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Yes, thank you. Hi, good afternoon everybody. Lori Ryerkerk : Hi Ghansham. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey Lori would you be able to give us a sense as to what the volume exit run rates for the Engineered Materials segment was as you cycled into the fourth quarter? What are you sort of baking in for the fourth quarter specifically? And also I realize this is real time but what are you hearing from customers given the incremental lockdowns in Europe at this point? Lori Ryerkerk : Overall for -- we expect probably 10% growth. That's though for the company. I'm not sure I really have it specified between EM and AC. But we expect about 10% growth before the impacts of seasonality for volume and price going from third quarter to fourth quarter. And I would say what we're hearing from our customers I mean just if you look at our order book that's probably the easiest way to talk about this. If you look at EM October is showing some modest improvement over Q3 the average of Q3. November is pretty consistent with that. December is -- we don't have as much view on that yet, but it's still showing that same kind of level of modest volume growth. But again we get some margin impact in December. And so far I would say we have not really seen any indications of demand destruction associated with this second wave of COVID either in Europe or in the U.S. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, great. Thank you so much. And then in terms of productivity, I mean you're calling out call it $0.25 in EPS 2021 versus 2020, net of the $35 million at the midpoint of temporary cost savings reversal. This year I think your productivity number is 200 plus. Is the $21 million drop on a year-over-year basis a function of just lower CapEx this year and then as you ramp that up, the trend line improves materially in 2022 or is there something else we're not considering? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, I think you have to look -- I mean look 2020 was an exceptional year. We had exceptional headwinds. So we went into this year planning to get about $150 million of gross productivity. We bumped that up to challenge the organization to $200 million which we will get that this year. We also had another $30 million to $40 million of onetime costs. So if you look at next year in comparison, we're currently targeting for at least $100 million of productivity on a gross basis. That's actually pretty typical to the level we've achieved over the last few years, if you just -- if you don't look at 2020. So we put that target out there of $100 million. I'm quite sure we'll achieve that. It's a little -- it looks a little lower when you look on the EPS because you have to offset that with the onetime cost savings we had this year things like not running our facilities that's full and not having travel and those sorts of expenses. So we fully expect those costs will come back in 2021 as we see ourselves running closer to full. And so that discounts that EPS number a little bit. But actually the $100 million growth we have is pretty consistent with what we achieved most years. And of course, we'll push for more but $100 million is what we've baked in right now. Scott Richardson : Yes Ghansham we did have the tow plant shutdown that occurred at the end of 2019 which was kind of a big item as we started 2020 that's in this year's number. And we don't have an item that large as we go into 2021. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much for referring Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good afternoon. Now that you've closed the Polyplastics transaction what is your estimate of the after-tax proceeds would be the first part? And then secondly of the proceeds I think you mentioned you intend to use $400 million to repurchase shares just in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering as a practical matter, if you determined whether to do that via an ASR or open market repurchases? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So for Polyplastics, we expect the after-tax proceeds to be something greater than $1.3 billion. We are repurchasing associated with that $500 million to assure there's -- the deal is accretive. We did do a portion of that in third quarter and we'll do the remainder in fourth quarter. Scott, you may want to answer the rest of the questions. Scott Richardson : Yes. We -- our strategy Kevin on repurchases has been to do open market and that's our plan here in the fourth quarter, as well as for the $400 million to $500 million that we outlined for next year as well. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Great. And then Scott as a brief follow-up for you I just had a housekeeping question on free cash flow in the third quarter. Like you mentioned in the materials yesterday that it was $351 million, so apparently a strong number there, of that amount you said you used $184 million to return to shareholders. Can you speak to what the balance of the free cash flow was used for? It looked like net debt just declined a little bit. Scott Richardson : Yes. We did end up -- we built a little bit of cash Kevin just mainly for uses geographic mix of where we needed cash. So cash on hand increased by roughly about $100 million from Q2 to Q3. Kevin McCarthy : Okay, I will circle back. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks very much for taking my question. I guess I was just kind of curious if I could ask this a different way. Maybe if you could help us understand your own volume levels from an exit run rate standpoint in Q3. In both EM and AC on a percentage basis are you running maybe about 80% or 85% of normal in certain markets? Or how would you kind of characterize your exit run rates on volume in each segment? Lori Ryerkerk : So I would characterize it acetyls we are just 1% below our 2019 levels. So I would characterize it as we are running pretty full everywhere again. Maybe we don't run every acetic acid plant full every day. That's not how we run it. It's not our strategy. But we -- our downstream derivatives everything is running full. I mean in Engineered Materials we are within 10% of where we were in this quarter in 2019 which is a pretty full quarter. So with the exception of things that are down for turnaround are starting to go down for turnaround like the IPH POM, I would say all of our facilities are running full. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. And then do you have any updates on your footprint optimization plan in AC and then also potentially adding some capacity in EM in China? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So as we said last quarter for -- we've talked about the acetic acid expansion in Clear Lake and optimization of our network to do that. We have delayed that expansion 18 months just in light of what lower oil prices and other things that make it attractive to continue to produce in other parts of the world. So that continues. So, no announced plans of what we're going to do with the rest of our capacity. And then in EM, we are continuing with a localization project in China. Again, a little bit of a change from where we were say half a year ago, and that originally we were looking at developing another site in China, in order to continue to expand both our polymerization, as well as our compounding and technology capabilities there. Due to some changes in Nanjing, which is where we have our other facilities we actually had some more land and facilities available to us. And so we've actually redesigned that project, if you will to take advantage of the efficiency of being able to expand on our existing locations. So those plans are continuing. You'll see more about that coming up. But those plans are continuing on a pace consistent with how we see the demand continuing to grow in China and the Asia region. Arun Viswanathan : Excellent. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Alex Yefremov : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. You've recently announced a price increase in Engineered Materials of up to 10%. Could you tell us what's your expected realizations maybe over the next couple of quarters? And also ,could you discuss what led to this announcement? Lori Ryerkerk : I'm sorry, Aleksey, I didn't hear the last part of your question. Alex Yefremov : Just could you discuss, what led to this announcement? Do you see tightness in any product lines or something like that? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks. So, yes we just did announce the price increase. I mean, as with all these things they take a little while to work through. So, if you think about it, with increasing raw materials, with -- so especially ethylene, but also increasing raws like acetic acid and all those building block chemicals that go into polymers. We announced a price increase to try to get out in front of that to make sure we didn't have margin compression. So that's what goes behind the announcement. It takes us -- it does take some weeks or months to work through the price increase, depending on contracts, depending on everything else, but we do expect to see those price increases flow through as we move into the fourth quarter. Alex Yefremov : Thank you, Lori. And also on Engineered Materials, your volumes were down 10% year-over-year. And you said in prepared remarks that automotive volumes were down 3% to 4% year-over-year. It also seems like appliances electronics are doing well. So is the minus 10%, primarily due to medical devices? This seems a bit tied relative to the weight of medical in your total volumes. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I would characterize that our volumes were down a little less than 10% year-on-year. If you look at all of our end markets from an industry basis that was -- that is still down 10% to 15%. So we're doing a little bit better, I would say than the end market. Auto we're down just 3%. Again, auto itself was down closer to 3% a little bit higher than that closer to 4%. We were helped thereby the fact that we think were aligned on good platforms like trucks and SUV in the U.S. and Germany, which has proven to be more robust as well as EV. Industrial is actually up a little bit year-on-year ,which has been a help for us. Electronics is pretty flat. But we are seeing appliances down year-on-year closer to that 10%. And medical, as we said is down about 15% currently year-on-year. So just really two sectors, I would say that have the biggest impact appliance and medical. But remember auto is the third, so even 3% down on auto is a fairly big impact for us. Alex Yefremov : Make sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Hi. Thanks. Two quick ones. First on EM, what is the culture around the growth platforms of the growth priorities i.e. should we expect to reshuffle every three to five years so that 5G might be replaced by a new growth theme? Or is it an organic evolution sort of bottoms-up driven by just the project mix? And secondly, on acetyls, should we expect a zero-carbon acetic acid production project in the next five years to be announced within the next five years? And if so would it have to be a greenfield? Or could you retrofit an existing facility? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Great question. I would say on -- sorry, let me answer the last question, first, because I've already forgotten your first question, because I've got to think about the last one. So for acetyl, what I think in the next five years, I would not expect a zero-carbon technology. I think, it's difficult to do. I mean, there are always ways gets to zero carbon through purchase of credits et cetera. I'm not sure yet. That's what our customers demand. That said, we constantly are looking at ways to reduce the carbon footprint of our existing facilities, whether it be through energy efficiency projects, the purchase of solar energy for our project like we've just done a big contract in Clear Lake; the use of bio-based methanols, which have a greener footprint. So we're constantly looking at ways to reduce our carbon footprint. I would just say at this point in time, we're not on track for a zero-carbon plant again unless we see a big change in demand from our customers. Scott Richardson : Yes. And on your first question Laurence about the Engineered Materials growth programs, I mean this is our model. We work this. We're constantly working with our customers and evolving those focused areas and where we have our resources on innovation to be able to adapt to the changing landscape. So yes, today it's things like 5G electric vehicles sustainable and recyclable polymers. As we go over the next -- and really it's something we're evaluating really every year is where should our focus be and continuing to adapt. So yes, three, four, five years from now we will be talking probably about some different things. Lori Ryerkerk : I would just add to that though. I think this is a little different than we did say several years ago which was all bottoms-up. We've added this overlay of themes because what we found is by waiting for the customers to come to us, we weren't necessarily getting to the right customer early enough in the development process to be their supplier of choice. So it has to be both going forward. It has to be bottoms-up as well as us looking at the landscape in the future and say what are the emerging themes and how do we make sure we're there from the beginning not waiting for someone to come to us. Laurence Alexander : All right. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bhavesh Lodaya with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bhavesh Lodaya : Hi, good afternoon, Lori. This is Bhavesh for John. So in terms of acetyls, we were a bit surprised to see acetic acid and VAM pricing being as soft as it was in China. And yet the industry itself seems to be running at pretty low downtime. So are you surprised at the high operating rates we are seeing right now? And then how should we think about the supply side of the equation as we think about next year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Bhavesh, you may remember, we called this out in our earnings call in second quarter, which was that we did expect modest volume recovery which we saw a bit better than expected. But we actually expected fairly flat pricing. And the reason was we said we didn't see the fundamentals in the industry to support more pricing. And I think in fact that's what we saw. So we did see an increase in demand in China almost a 10% Q-on-Q increase in demand, but we also saw outages fall by a third. So then more supply came on to basically meet that demand. And as a result utilization in China was pretty flat right at that 70% level. And that's why we didn't think we'd see pricing increase and in fact why we didn't see the pricing increase. Now as we move towards the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we are seeing raw material prices come up. That's starting to push prices up. Generally that results in slightly better margins. But I would say to really see a good strong price recovery we're going -- and margin recovery we're just going to need to see that utilization especially in China continue to improve. Bhavesh Lodaya : Got it. And then a quick question on, in terms of how the sales are. So what percentage of the acetyl business is being sold through the derivatives like emulsions and powders? And how should we think about maintaining that dynamic going forward? Because it certainly seems that that's smoothening out some of the volatility in the business. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, absolutely. And that's definitely part of our strategy which is to control as much of the chain as we can, so that we always have the choice not just geographically where to produce and where to sell, but also where in the chain to produce and sell. So if you look at our flexibility, we move anywhere from 40% to 60% of our acetic acid into downstream derivatives. And we flex that depending on what's more attractive.  And constantly, we try to -- we're continuing to build more VAM, more VAE, we bought Elotex. We continue to do things to give us more flexibility in that chain and more ability to move things around. I mean -- and a good example I think of that is, if you look this year -- this quarter sorry, third quarter, the amount of acid we sold into China was actually 20% less than what we sold in 2019 at the same time because of these kind of $300 per ton that wasn't attractive.  We moved that volume into derivatives in China, which had better margins and also into other regions of the world. And you can see that really as well in the total if you look at kind of the share of acetyl earnings that came from the very end of the chain emulsions and redispersibles last year that was around 15%. This year that's around 25%. So I think that just shows the -- just an example the flexibility that we have in the model to really move to where the better margins are whether it be geographically or acid versus derivatives. Bhavesh Lodaya : Okay. Thanks for your time. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Thank you. Good afternoon and congrats Brandon on your new role. If I could just follow up on that acetic acid question in China. I just saw something in ACEs [ph] that showed operating rates reaching levels not seen in a year over 90%, seems rather high. So I guess are we ready to declare that China is fully back and we're restocking? Or how do we think about operating rates over 90% in China? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I'd have to see the data Frank to be fair. There's a lot of different numbers reported. We are not seeing that kind of return in terms of utilization based on the numbers that we look at. Scott Richardson : Dividend is strong Frank, I mean there's no doubt it has improved in China. I don't know if we're ready to call it that it's back if you will. But certainly, demand was strong at the end of the third quarter. And so far the order books, as we see things into November, do suggest that the end of the year in China in acetyls should be pretty good. Frank Mitsch : Got you. Thank you. And Scott, I think Celanese had been talking about a 2020 free cash flow target, most recently of $800 million plus. Following this very strong third quarter, you're about $30 million to $40 million short. How do we think about 2020 free cash flow for the company? And I guess, a lot of the discussion has been on 2021 and you're going to see higher earnings from productivity turnarounds, recovery but you're also going to see higher CapEx. Can you talk about what your expectations are on the free cash flow side? Scott Richardson : Yes. The $800 million to $900 million for this year is still a good number. We think we'll be in that range even with some tax payments that will be made relative to the transaction that we completed. So that's still a good range for this year. And then as we look forward into next year, a lot will depend honestly Frank, as to where demand is. But we think that working capital inventory levels will be kind of at the run rate where we need them as we end this year. So we shouldn't have a big working capital pickup that occurs next year. And so it should be pretty robust and we feel comfortable with where cash flow is going to be to call out that -- those repurchases of $400 million to $500 million for next year and we expect those to come from free cash flow. Frank Mitsch : Great. Thank you so much. Brandon Ayache : Doug, we\u2019ll make the next question our last question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Lori, I was just hoping, I could circle back to the electric vehicle space. I mean, it really sounds like your opportunity is in the battery side. Do you have any other opportunities we should be thinking about? And also does the growth of EVs -- does that help your existing plastics business into the auto sector? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. No there's -- we talk about lithium-ion battery separators because we are such a major player in that component and clearly that's the easy one to see. But frankly EVs in themselves are a great opportunity for the polymer space. I mean, so you think about the literally miles of electrical cabling, all of which needs connectors. That's a great opportunity for us. You think about how quiet EVs are, and the fact that now people don't want to hear all the squeaks and things that used to be covered up by the sound of the motor. So great application for things like POM that have really good tribology and can minimize the amount of wearing between components that lead to those squeaks. The electric vehicle has significantly more accessible polymer space if you will for us than a conventional vehicle, just in terms of because it needs to be light, in order to have range and all those things I just spoke about. So we actually have a lot of placements in electric vehicles for any range of components from interiors, to as I said, everything about the electrical system and more and more under the hood there as well. So it is a big space for us. We see -- continue to see it as a big opportunity and one as I said we've really been focused on since the end of 2019. Matthew Blair : Okay. Thanks. Operator : There's no further questions. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. We'd like to thank everybody for listening in today. As usual, we're available after the call for any further questions you might have. Doug, please go ahead and close out the call at this time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Brandon Ayache, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Doug. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Senior Director of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its fourth quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website.  Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open it up for your questions. Doug, please go ahead and open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. JohnRoberts: Great, thank you and nice quarter and nice outlook there. Could you give us an update on the M&A environment for advanced materials deals? LoriRyerkerk:  Sure. Yes. I think as we said, John, in the written comments we are anxious to pursue M&A. We have a good pipeline of both bolt-ons and transformational deals that we've been looking at. I would say earlier in the year, I think people were just trying to sort out how to deal with COVID, how to deal with the current environment how to manage their cash flows. And so we really didn't see a lot of interest from other parties in terms of discussing M&A. I would say as we move here through the fourth quarter, and people start to see markets returning more to normal and feel more confident about their outlook for 2021. And therefore a reasonable valuation basis, we are starting to see people having more interest in discussions around M&A. So I'd say the market is opening up. Obviously, it takes us a little while to get through these discussions. But definitely looking better as we go into 2021. JohnRoberts: Thanks. And then cig tow prices increase? We've got kind of an unusually strong environment. I mean, US cigarette smoking, I think, didn't decline for the first year in a long time. And I'm guessing it's up in China. And you had a potential transaction that you worked on a while ago in cig toe? I didn't know were there any opportunities here to revisit that? LoriRyerkerk: Yes, look, I think on Toe we did see some drop in prices from 2019 to 2020. Those were based on the negotiations that happened in 2019 going into 2020. As we've been negotiating in 2020 for 2021, I'd say the prices are stable, and in some cases a little bit up. So I do think there's, as you said, we saw less decline in smoking last year than expected in some areas, even an increase in smoking, I guess people had more time at home. So we really do see that prices stabilizing now for toe and maybe even a little bit of upward movement. So that's good. So if you look at our outlook for toe, we're basically saying, we think for the next many years, it's going to be pretty much flat at this kind of 250 to 260 ranges. In terms of transaction, look, we didn't get to do the transaction last time because of competition concerns in the EU, there's nothing that's changed in the landscape that makes that difference. So I think it's unlikely that we would be able to do similar type transactions even today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. RobertKoort: Thank you very much, Lori, I was intrigued by your comments about changing the production base in acetic relatively initial plans. And if you reference maybe some advantageous to all material contracts, can you talk a little bit more about what that allows you to do? And why it's now feasible to keep that production at stated rates instead of paring it back a bit? LoriRyerkerk: Yes, sure. We had originally announced Clear Lake expansion from 1.3 million tons to 2 million tons. When we did that, we assumed we would either shut down or cut back capacity in Asia. So it's kind of a net capacity neutral. And the project was based on -- it was justified based on productivity. When we made the decision to delay the project for 18 months given the low oil environment, the uncertainties around COVID, et cetera, we took that as an opportunity to really go back and reexamine the basis for the project. And in doing so we found another 50 million of savings and capital we could make in the project. We also had a chance to go work with some of our suppliers in Asia, and we're able to negotiate during that low raw material environments and very favorable contracts going forward, both for Singapore and for Nanjing, which makes both of those locations more attractive from a competitiveness standpoint. And we also found other sources productivity is specifically around catalysts, usage and Clear Lake and some other, that when we really looked at it and total, we said, what, given also the strong recovery, we're seeing in acidic acid, our view to the future that acetic acid will continue to grow at GDP plus maybe a little bit more. If we said, it really makes more sense for us to go ahead and do the expansion at Clear Lake, which by the way, we're actually going to be able to expand Clear Lake to be about 2.6 million tons capable. So we will do that larger expansion at Clear Lake, keep all the facilities available to us and running in Asia, which, again, we won't run them full necessarily, we will run them to meet what we need in the market and meet the demand. But gives us the option in the future if we do see more robust growth to run them at higher rates. And we still get the same level of productivity and credit on a smaller capital base in Clear Lake. So actually, I think the delay turned out to be a good thing, we actually had a chance to go back and reexamine some elements of the project and have what I think is a stronger, more robust economically project now as well as additional capacity we can use for the future. RobertKoort: Got it. Thank you and then the KEPCO JV turning into a manufacturing JV. Is that an earnings enhancement for you? Or is it just greater flexibility that can then lead to some earnings enhancement? How should we think about that from the bottom line numbers standpoint? LoriRyerkerk: Yes. I think I'll also let Scott comment, but I mean, really, it's based on what we've said in the past, which is we want the flexibility to move the molecules ourselves into high end market using our business model. So in the past KEPCO marketed all of the molecules, now we will have our 50% of the molecules that we can market and we can move into what we think will be hopefully more attractive end market. So that flexibility we believe will give us higher returns. And then there I think there are also some accounting changes that happened with that. And Scott, you may want to comment on. ScottRichardson: Yes, and I think the other thing to add, Bob, is we will get synergies here, I mean, by now having more polymer capacity in Asia. And having 50% of that output we're going to be able to realign our supply chain. So think about us getting synergies from this deal. And kind of being like a bolt-on M&A deal. So adding, call it 20-ish million dollars of earnings over a three year period of time, and it didn't cost anything to get it. So we're excited about that. You will see the equity earnings line which comes in on an after tax basis, that will the portion that kind of flips to the marketing return that we get, we'll move above the line. And we will then add revenue, obviously, for what we're selling there onto the P&L. Equity earnings will come down over time. And as we stated with the announcement, we expect that to close sometime later this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. VincentAndrews: Thank you and good morning, everyone. If I could just ask on the shape of the year, it sounds like you're expecting acetyl to normalize in 2Q and 3Q and then presumably have more of a normalized seasonal 4Q. And I just want on that piece what -- why is it going to come back into 2Q? I get that it's already sort of settling down a little bit. But is there a case for it to stay sort of above that $170 million to $200 million range that you're expecting for the second and third quarter. And then on engineered materials, if you could just help us understand how you think the shape of that's going to play out? I know one of the big drivers is going to be how fast the healthcare part comes back. But how are you thinking of that? And then again, on the fourth quarter, how do we lap an unusual 4Q, 2020? And hopefully a more normalized 2021 environment. LoriRyerkerk: Yes, thanks, Vincent. So starting with acetyl, yes, we do expect a really robust first quarter as we guided to, and we do expect some normalization as we move into second quarter. And what could really change that. I mean, if you look at what's driving, kind of the 4Q, and let's call it really December, and the 1Q pricing we've had more robust demand, all in China, I would say, for acetic acid and for VAM. So it really has been more demand led. There have been a number of shorter outages in China for acetic acid and VAM, if you actually look at the data. It's not been significantly different than most four quarters. So I would say the tightness we've seen in December and going into January, February has really been demand driven.  Now some of those outages that we've had, although there was a few more in January, which has given us some volatility in acetic acid, those plants are coming back online. And that's what we say kind of once plants are back, as people now have adjusted to this new level of demand, I mean, quite frankly, we saw what we thought was a little bit of panic bind over these three months where people because demand was coming up. And because there was a few outages responded by doing a little bit of restocking because it made them nervous. I think that's going to calm down as we go forward. And people see security of supply and a more stable demand outlook. Now, clearly, look if there's another outage, especially if there were an outage in the Western Hemisphere could we see these conditions, this kind of $500 to $700 per ton conditions continue on into the second quarter. I mean, we could, it's just we don't have any visibility of right that right now. And so we would say we expect it to kind of normalize to normal ranges. I would expect we should have we expect $170 million to 200 million, every quarter through the rest of the year. That's what we consider a pretty normalized level of earnings for acetyl and fully expect to be in that range. For engineer materials, we got it to $120 million on some modest price and volume recovery. Obviously, we're seeing headwinds from raw, so we are making price movements that we think will largely offset that movement we've seen in raw. I would expect a little bit of improvement on that in second and third quarter typical, what we see those being stronger demand month. We should also expect a little bit more recovery in our affiliate earnings. So expect to see that roll through in second and third quarter. And then fourth quarter typically looks more like first quarter. So I would think of it that way for the year. VincentAndrews: Okay and maybe just a follow up on the M&A in the prepared remarks. I know you talked about sort of having a look around at halftime and in the middle of the year and seeing where the M&A environment is. Is that a function of just sort of wanting to make a decision on how to use your cash flow for the year and not necessarily build any if you're not going to use it? Or do you think there's really something about the middle of the years in terms of specific transactions or anything in particular? LoriRyerkerk: Yes, I would say that the mid-year is really just about making sure we don't sit on cash for too long. If we don't have any M&A clearly in sight. Look, we can always go borrow later to do the M&A. We're at a very low leverage. So that's not a problem. And it also represents what we can effectively buy back shares about $400 to $500 in the first half. We probably can't really do a lot more than that. So it's also a time where you go, okay, now we need to reevaluate. We need to go above that level that we had stated in the guidance. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. DuffyFischer: Yes, good morning. First one is maybe two parts around JV. So on KEPCO, is the idea there that that will basically sell to the partners at cost? Or will KEPCO actually try to make a profit? And then could you also size the liquid crystal plant roughly kind of what the capital spend would be there? And then how accretive should that be to earnings when it starts to run? ScottRichardson: Yes, let me take that KEPCO question, Duffy. So we will have some small trading profit there for KEP, it'll be a cost plus basis. Going forward and once that's finalized, at closing, we'll make sure everyone's aware of what that is. LoriRyerkerk: Great, and on the LCP, we're looking at doing this expansion in China or this build in China in phases. So if you look at the size of it, the first phase will be pretty much the same as our current capacity. So double our current capacity on LCP. The cost of that is going to be less than $100 million. Startup won't be until early 2024. So not sure financially what that looks like by then. But I would say we would expect it to be accretive fairly quickly as we already have demand in sight for that time at startup. DuffyFischer: Correct. And then could you give us a little preview on what you want to highlight in your Investor Day coming up? LoriRyerkerk: Sure. I think for Investor Day, we're really looking at we want to reconfirm our plans to achieve double digit EPS year-on-year growth over the next three years. So it's going to be based on a number of things. First, continuing to outline a more robust program of organic growth. And you've seen some of that already with our announcements around the DUR expansion in the US, LCP build, putting our acetic acid projects back on the table, and actually at a slightly bigger expansion than we had previously. We're going to talk a lot about innovation in end markets, and especially the programs that we started in electric vehicles, and 5G and medical pharma. We're already seeing good results from that really good growth and expect that to continue. So we'll be talking more about those and giving some examples. And then we'll be talking quite a lot about ESG. Not just our commitment to ESG, but also a lot around sustainable products and the advancements we're making and sustainable products in the areas like BlueRidge, like Ecomid, like Bio-POM, so those will be the main focus on Investor Day. As well as we will talk more about cash deployment and our outlook for cash deployment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. MikeSison: Hey, good morning, and nice finish to the year there. Can you maybe talk a little bit about some of the project momentum, used to talk about projects a lot over the last couple years for EM? And in particular areas, you're seeing a lot of sort of requests or growth there. And how does that sort of look when you look at the outlook for EM and 21? LoriRyerkerk: Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. Yes, let's talk about projects a little bit. And I think this year is a good example of why we're starting to transition a little bit away from number of projects to more towards value of projects. So if you look at 2020, we actually with all the challenges of COVID and everything else ended up ending the year with about 90% of the number of project wins as we had in 2019. But if you look at the value of the wins we had in 2020, they were actually right at the same level as the value of the ones we had in 2019. And that's really what we're focusing on projects, which is not just are we generating a high number, but are we generating projects that have value and have extended value. So we've really been focusing on projects wins in some of those program areas I mentioned earlier. So things like future mobility around electric vehicles, and autonomous and connectivity, so 5G and those sorts of things. And mobile, if you look at it, for example, the growth in the number of projects we've had in terms of value is more than 65% for autonomous vehicles, and autonomous and electric vehicles, and for connectivity, it's over 60%. So we're really shifting our focus to those. I would say newer focuses, things that we think are going to have long life, and we're having a very high success rate in those areas. So if we look towards next year clearly we would expect that value to continue to grow. It needs to grow to continue to meet our expectations for EBIT growth year-on-year. So we continue to but again we focusing on value of projects wins, not just number of project wins. MikeSison: Got it. And then in terms of acquisitions, are there any -- are you sort of maybe give us a framework? Are you looking for new polymers to add to the portfolio, the technologies, maybe focusing on end markets? And then is there a difference in what you're looking for versus a bolt-on and transformational deal? LoriRyerkerk: Yes, I wouldn't say our philosophy has changed around M&A. Our philosophy is the same; we are looking at projects that meet our return thresholds, and also meet our strategic criteria. So those things that you just laid out. So we're looking at geography; we're looking at, yes, we'd love to always add new polymers, we're looking at additional capability. So sometimes like some of the ones we did with Next and Omni adding recycle capability. We're always looking to add new capability there. So I would say that's not changed. I would say, given the time we had this year in 2020. We've used to cast maybe a little broader net, than we've had before and looked at some other not just polymers, but other chemistry that use a similar business model to what we use in EM. And that we think we could add value to. So I'd say we're looking broadly to make sure we're not missing any opportunities to really grow value for the shareholder. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. HassanAhmed: Good morning, Lori. Question around EM segment margins. Obviously, they compress sequentially to sub 20% levels, and obviously under normalized macro conditions historically they were north of 30%. Now, I'm obviously cognizant of the fact that there was some sort of turnaround expenses baked into that margin number, but I just wanted to sort of get your view on when you expect to see a reversal or a return to those 30% plus EBITDA margin levels. LoriRyerkerk: Yes, well, Hassan thanks for the question. You're exactly right. I mean this year our margins were compressing EM for two reasons, I would say. One is the pretty significant amount of turnaround expense we had this year with both the Bishop and the IPH POM turned around. So those were two very large turnarounds, which we also had quite a bit of inventory draw to cover those. So those together had a pretty significant impact. The other thing this year is with lower volumes. And we ran plants in second and third quarter certainly at with some shut down for a period of time, some run at lower rate. This is a high fixed cost business. And so that fixed cost gets spread across the rest of the volumes. And that certainly had an impact on our margins. I would say, as we go into 2021, I would certainly expect to be back at that, excuse me, because I always think of EBIT. But at that kind of 20% to 25% range of EBIT margins, as we go into 2021. And we see back to normal rates of volume and kind of a normal level of turnaround activity. ScottRichardson: Yes and Hassan just one thing to add to that with the sale of share of Polyplastics that will come out of that. So that is one of the things that did inflate that number up. And that has been kind of running on average around $40 million or so a year. So that will be out permanently going forward. And that's why on an EBIT basis, kind of being in that 20%, 25% is where we think we'll be in 2021. HassanAhmed: Very helpful. And as a follow up on the Acetyl Chain side, obviously very strong margins in Q4. And Lori you touched on some of the drivers, obviously, pricing it was there. And you talked about some outages and sort of demand rebounding again and the like. I just wanted to sort of dig deeper into the sustainability of those sorts of margin levels. It seems that there is a bunch of moving parts, obviously coal prices have gone up quite a bit in China obviously, and methanol has gone up. I would expect that would moderate or maybe even come down on a go forward basis, then obviously there's the whole sort of notion of higher shipping costs, and maybe those sort of coming into higher pricing levels and the like. So could you just help me sort of think through the sustainability of the sort of Q4 margin levels within Acetyl Chain? LoriRyerkerk: Sure, look, we think sustainable margins in Acetyl and are $170 million to $200 million. We consider those kind of a foundational level of earnings and therefore sustainable over a pretty wide variety of conditions. And I think it's really based on the flexibility we have in the chain and the optionality we have in the chain. I mean, earlier in the year, although we weren't at those levels we saw still good returns from acetyl because we were able, even with a acetic acid demand being down, VAM being strong, emulsions being stronger, being able to flex our chain to produce more of those molecules. Now with an acetic acid stronger, we can flex back and put more back into acidic acid. So that flexibility that we have and that geographic flexibility, I mean, as you say, Nanjing with coal prices up, but natural gas prices aren't really up in the Gulf Coast. And we still have all that Clear Lake capacity. So that we just shift more to Clear Lake and take advantage of low US Gulf Coast natural gas prices. Oils have been fairly low. So that's made our Singapore capacity pretty attractive. So having that geographical as well as the flexibility within the chain, we think gives us a lot of optionality across a wide range of economic conditions and that's why we feel that $170 million to $200 million is very sustainable. Now the higher level that we're seeing kind of at $225 million plus level that we're predicting for Q1 that's a little higher -- harder level to sustain. That's really based on some very high acidic acid pricing specifically in China. But certainly not $170 million to $200 million we think is sustainable. ScottRichardson: Yes, on a percentage basis, the sustainability there, Hassan, I think we've shown over the last several years that this business is going to do greater than 20% EBIT, tight margins, and that put the EBITDA and kind of the mid-20 range 25-ish percent. And we expect that to continue as we go forward and are pretty strong in those areas in 2021 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. GhanshamPanjabi: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, Lori, obviously, there was a lot of complexity throughout 2020 from a macro standpoint just given the disruptions et cetera. As you look back at 4Q and what you're seeing it current, is it just sort of transitory disruptions and commodity tightness that is driving the improvement in AC and EM segments? Or do you see more confidence from customers, as relates to some level of global reflation sustainability? And if you could just sort of touch on that dynamic across the various geographic regions? That would be helpful. Thanks. LoriRyerkerk: Yes, I would say we definitely see confidence from customers and people being more certain going forward. I would look at that current resurgence of COVID is clearly has been as bad the last few months as it was in the early days of COVID. But yes, we have not seen our customers shutting down. We haven't been seeing them cutting back. We continue to continue to see robust consumer behavior around the globe. And so I think that's giving everyone confidence, we just aren't seeing the impact now from COVID. I mean, if you look, we're really getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we're not hearing anything different from customers. So I think truly demand is driving the increase that we're seeing in the Acetyl Chain, I think demand is driving the increases we're seeing in EM. Now we have had some bumpiness and volatility in December and into the first few months of this year in acetyl. I think that's been based on people because they are confident about the future being worried about these, what turned out to be fairly minor supply disruptions and causing some volatility in the market. But I think overall, and the reason we are optimistic about 2021 and growth into 2021 is overall we really see confidence by our customers and continued growth in the markets and that steady increase in demand. GhanshamPanjabi: Okay, and then in terms of the EM segment, and your comment on higher raw material costs. You had a margin lagged last time; we had a mini inflation cycle, if you will, in the raw material side. How are you approaching pricing for this segment this time around? I realize there's a mix impact from healthcare, et cetera. But just your view in terms of how you're navigating the current raw material cost paradigm? Thanks again LoriRyerkerk :  Great, thanks Ghansham. Yes, we made a price increase in the fourth quarter. I would say we didn't see -- you wouldn't have seen a lot of impacts to the bottom line from that. But that was really to get in front of some of these raw material increases we were seen, and certainly in December, and then no see expecting them to continue into the first quarter. We've made another price increase here in the first quarter. We think that should be enough to kind of keep us in front of the -- in the raw material environment that's developing. And basically keep us keep us flat, if you will, fourth quarter to first quarter. So we think we're out in front of it. I mean, our teams do a great job keeping our eyes on raw materials and trying to figure out what's happening and making sure that we can put sufficient price increases out there to cover the cost of raw materials. But there is always a bit of a lag especially in EM between when we see raw material increases and when we see them in our books and when we can pass through prices. I think in this case we have pretty low inventory. So we're seeing that a bit sooner, but feel confident that the price increases that we've made will be enough to largely offset the raw material increases in the first quarter. ScottRichardson: Yes and we should see the benefit of Ibn Sina and the equity earnings there and improving as that is a natural hedge for the engineer materials, business, as a partial offset to some of the raw material inflation that we're seeing there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J.Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Lori, you decided to keep the Asia capacity in acetyl. Can you tell us how the acetyl's profitability is today in natural gas versus oil versus coal? Maybe just give us a snapshot. So we can understand the rationale behind the decision because one would think that the coal based production would be disadvantaged today. LoriRyerkerk: Yes, if you look at this, I mean, clearly the US Gulf Coast has an advantage. And we don't really see any scenarios where natural gas prices go up to the point where there wouldn't be that advantage. That's clearly an advantage. If you look at Clear Lake, the combination of our size, our ability to generate our own methanol, and from our own CO, all that, I mean, in our technology, the Celanese technology; Clear Lake is probably definitely the lowest end of the cost curve, if you look at acetic acid producers around the world, but because of our technology and because of some of the contracts that we've been able to negotiate, if you look at Singapore certainly kind of at this $40 to $50 oil, it is also very cost competitive. And even Nanjing even at higher coal prices, I would say all of our facilities are in the top 25% to 30% in terms -- top meaning the best 25% or 30% of all of the acetic acid facilities in the world. So, yes, although Singapore and Nanjing are higher cost producers, they are still highly competitive with other players around the world. Scott Richardson : Yes, and PJ, as we said in the prepared remarks, one of the important parts of the strategy is flexibility and the raw material agreements that we now have in place plus the CO unit acquisition we did a few years ago, and now being under our control, giving us that ability to flex up and down gives us a lot more optionality than we've ever had in the past. And so we are really excited about the ability to flex as needed based upon different raw material environments, which as we know will move all over the place over time. Lori Ryerkerk : I would also mention, PJ, that shipping and distribution is not an insignificant cost and is going up these days. And so maintaining that capacity in Asia to serve the Asian market is also attractive versus shipping everything necessarily from the US. P.J. Juvekar: Great, thank you. And a question for Scott. First of all, congratulations on buying back stock. Not many companies were able to do that in 2020. So your timing was good as you replace Polyplastics capacity in Asia, which is the growth market, you build LCP, and maybe a few other appliances what kind of total CapEx do you need over the next few years? And your M&A comment, is that M&A mostly targeted towards Asia to replace Polyplastics? Thank you. Scott Richardson : Well, let me start and then I'll have Lori talk about views on capital going forward. I mean, look, we've been very consistent in wanting kind of a balanced capital deployment strategy and also being able to take advantage of the options that come in front of us. And so we want to be able to do M&A, we feel really good about not just the cash we have on hand. But the additional firepower that we have on the balance sheet being very clean. And as earnings continue to improve that will only give us more horsepower to do M&A going forward. And so we felt like it was the right time to bring forward our plan on the 2021 repurchases and doing the first half. And we'll continue to monitor the M&A pipeline and we'll pivot as needed throughout the year. The $500 million or so that we expect in capital this year is kind of the first tranche of this wave of organic growth that we've been kind of weaving in and sprinkling in with announcements here in the last six months or so. And as Lori talked about before, that's going to be an important part of our Investor Day story that we have in March. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, and I would say in terms of capital deployment, yes. I expect will be at this kind of $500 million level of CapEx for the next few years really focused on organic growth and while a lot of it will be in Asia, so LCP is an example. We've talked about trying to build our compounding as well as our technology capability in Asia is really about having the ability to respond quickly to our customers in Asia. We're also making investments in other parts of the world. I mean, we've had the formerly Center of Excellence to better serve our European customers. We've talked about the Bishop GUR expansion, and we continue to do footprint optimization in the US to better it and also technology build out in the US to better serve our US and North American customers. So I would say that growth is going to be all over the world, maybe a bit more Asia focus, but it really spread where we need it to best serve our customers. And I would say in terms of what we're replacing. I would like to mention while Polyplastics, it was always marketed by Polyplastics. So those molecules weren't really in our portfolio, if you would say. We're really excited about KEP. In fact, that we now will be able to put those molecules into our portfolio as part of our Asia footprint. And now it gives us POM capacity globally, which we really didn't have before. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Thank you. Lori, is that 2.6 million tons of capacity in Clear Lake, it stays capable, is that fully online 2023? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it will have that capability fully in 2023. Now we need methanol and things to go with that. And we're working on that. But that capacity would be able to come up to that rate at the startup. So essentially will double the size of Clear Like capacity. David Begleiter : Are you expecting your announcements last night on capacity to forestall some other capacity in the marketplace that you might be coming on stream? Lori Ryerkerk : I can't say what others will deal with the news that they have. But we certainly think this is lowest capacity add available to the market much, much lower than any Greenfield would be, and probably even lower than most other expansion can be. So we'll let others make their decision from there. David Begleiter : If I can have one more just been EM, do you think more about as you move to a more value based approach, less volume and higher margins going forward in this segment? Is that fair? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, we always focus on margin. I would say we're also though focusing on volume in terms of we think that we can add more volume to our system and get high margins on them as well. So I don't think it's a trade off. But we certainly are at the point where we think we need to add additional volume in order to continue to deliver into high value markets. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : Thanks. Perhaps a little bit on that line of questioning. So you expanded your DUR plant pretty recently, and since then EV sales have picked up fairly significantly. Where are you on filling out that new capacity? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, so the Bishop DUR plant won't start up until really early 2022. Obviously, we would like to get it up as soon as possible because that market is growing very robustly, to put it in perspective, that business grew 25% in 2020 versus 2019. So we are anxious to get that plant up and expect to certainly fill it out within the first year or so of startup. Matthew DeYoe : I got ahead of you there. And then so you'd mentioned demand is starting to pull back and you see the gas market as prices increase. Is that substitution? Or is it simply just price sensitivity and people subsiding on that panic buying you were talking about? Lori Ryerkerk : I don't -- so Matthew, I'm not sure where you got that. We're not really seeing demand pullback yet in acidic acid. We actually think we're kind of back at normalized levels of demand. There's a little bit of supply insecurity as there were some minor outages in Asia. And a little bit of panic buying people restocking worrying that those, I think, because they thought maybe those outages will be longer. But I would say the level of demand we're at now is holding fairly steady from fourth quarter last year into first quarter this year. And I think it's really a normalized level of demand that we should expect to see going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. On slide 11 of your supplemental materials, you're kind enough to give us volume numbers for each of your segments. And as I look at those numbers, looks like you grew Acetyl Chain volumes 19% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. And so I was wondering, yes, I know you had the Clear Lake outage. Is that a representative number? And if it is could you just talk about your operating rates these days in acetyl relative to the broader industry? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so if you look at Q4 2019, to Q4 2020, we did grow volume, as you mentioned about 19%. There are a number of factors there. First is we did add Elotex in April of 2020. So there's some volume that comes with Elotex that gets added to those numbers. We did see, of course, demand recovery in fourth quarter of 2020, and some tightness in the market, which helps drive volumes up. I would also remind you we had a fairly significant outage at our Clear Lake plant in fourth quarter of last year. And although we had secured some volumes last year to cover that fourth quarter last year was actually a little bit softer quarter than we typically have seen in acetyl. So I would say one, it was a strong fourth quarter for acetyl in terms of demand. Certainly the best we've seen this year, not surprising with COVID. But even good versus last year, as we see the market normalizing, we saw a little less seasonality. We saw some seasonality in emulsion. But we were able to ship that volume into strong demand for acid and VAM especially in China. And that's really where we saw the difference in strength this year, much stronger demand in China this year, Western Hemisphere about the same. Kevin McCarthy : Maybe you anticipated my follow up question. I think in earlier in 2012, you talked about shifting volumes downstream into emulsions and perhaps other derivatives. Has that reversed? Or how would you characterize the outlook there for the acetyl's mix here in early 2021? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I would say VAM demand; VAM pricing is also very strong right now. Emulsion is a little softer right now, which is -- but that's really a seasonal impact as it's colder, less demand for paints and coatings. So probably a little bit more in the first quarter into acetic acid, especially the higher acetic gas and pricing we're seeing in China, but I will tell you across the entirety of the chain right now, we're seeing a lot of strength in acetyl. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lori, you elected to expand Clear Lake and with Singapore acetic acid capacity. So your total capacity would be larger than the initial plan or shutting down Singapore? Why wouldn't the benefits of this expansion be larger than the initial $100 million benefits? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so we actually never said we were going to shut down Singapore. We always said that we would look at reducing capacity in Asia, which could have been Singapore or Nanjing or a combination of the two. Clearly with the supply contracts now we have an intention to run all three of them flexibly and as needed to meet demand. So look on Clear Lake, yes, the capacity that we've announced is larger. What we have justified the projects on and the credits that we've shared are simply the productivity. So we've assumed even if the market needs no additional capacity, what are the benefits, so we get $100 million benefit on that $350 million investment. Clearly, if there is more demand in the market, and it makes sense to run Clear Lake higher or other facilities around the world at higher rates, then there is a lot of additional upside for this project. But that was not our justification for the project. So that's just all upside for the future if we see above the p type of growth and are able to produce into it. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you for this and have you made a decision whether to integrate it into methanol directly by building or acquiring capacity or whether to purchase it in the merchant markets in the US for this expansion? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I mean we are still looking at methanol and what we want to do around here like methanol as you know we already have a JV there with our partner, Mitsui. So we are really looking at do we want to expand. We have the capability for a very low cost expansion to get about another 25% capacity there. We're also looking at are there opportunities to do things with recycled streams and others. So the good news is in the US, there's very strong commodity methanol market. So we always have the opportunity to buy methanol as well. And quite frankly, we like having the exposure to the market, we like having our own if you look at it right now, we produce about 35% to 40% of the methanol that we need in our own system. And going forward after the expansion, certainly after the initial phases, we still have about that amount. But quite frankly, we're still in the process of deciding what we want to do in Clear Lake in terms of methanol expansion, or whether we just want to continue on the market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Maybe this one for Scott. So when I look at the earnings that you're calling for this year, it's roughly in line with what we saw in 2019. Back then you generated about $1.1 billion of free cash flow. So it seems like the better than $700 million number that you're putting out for this year, maybe on the light side, are there any major puts and takes that we should be thinking about when kind of comparing the two? I know the CapEx is going to be up a bit, but doesn't seem like it makes up anywhere near the difference? So I guess how should we be thinking about that? Scott Richardson : Yes. So John, I kind of break it into three categories. The first is the CapEx, as you mentioned, call that $100 and $150 million or so increase. The next is the 100 or so million that we had with the EU settlement, which has already been paid here in the month of January. And the last area is kind of what I would call a working capital rebuild a bit here. Obviously, working capital came way off during 2020. We also saw raw materials fall line, so that was magnified. Now we see as the business really returns and things move up, there is a natural rebuild of working capital that will come with that. In addition, we're expecting higher raw material environment. So that will then kind of add another layer on to that working capital. So those are really the three components. I would not look at things being anything fundamentally different in interoperation to just more kind of timing of some of these things coming in. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. How do you think your engineered materials volumes in 2021 will compare to 2019? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think if we look at the volumes, so if you look at our base business volumes, our volumes in 2021, I think will be very comparable to 2019 and maybe even -- certainly our sales on our base business we think will be above 2019. But the volumes will be comparable to maybe slightly better. So I think our base business is going to back to that 2019 level. And again, that assumes some level of recovery, but not all in medical. So medical is not a huge volume. But it is a huge earnings so there is some additional upside if we would see earlier return of elective procedures, then we're currently having the forecast. Jeff Zekauskas : What do you think the EBIT penalty was from medical in 2020? Lori Ryerkerk : In 2020 it was 10s of millions. So it was significant when you look at it on the EM base earnings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Good morning. Nice enter to the year and nice dividend hike. I wanted to ask that volume question on acetyl a little bit differently, it was up sequentially 6% in acetic VAM and EVA. And you also mentioned that you proactively sourced material prior to your turnaround. So I was just curious, the proactive sourcing was that kind of a -- was that a very neat match in terms of what you lost from your turnaround or how should we think about what you might have been able to do if you didn't have that turnaround? And I was just curious to see higher volumes in 4Q relative to 3Q. So I was just trying to understand a little bit better how that worked out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, well, I think the higher volumes in fourth quarter versus third quarter a lot is just based upon demand recovery and producing into that demand. You're right, we lost some volume in Clear Lake, but we did buy volumes in order to provide our customers around the globe to replace that. We also always do watch the market. And if we see what we think is a tightening market and the higher demand market, we will source additional materials in order to anticipate customer needs and make sure we have sufficient volumes together. So all of those three things I think came together in the fourth quarter, and what we ended up seeing was both very high volumes demand quarter, as well as a very good pricing quarter. Frank Mitsch : Yes, I know [Indiscernible] ahead. Certainly it was a very good pricing quarter. And obviously your results reflected that. Typically a lot of purchasing agents will try and get ahead of price increases et cetera. And so do you have any good feel as to what amount of that demand was restock? Or how do you think about that just in general inventory levels at your customers as they stand when 4Q went today? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, we think there was a little bit of restock happening in Asia, not really the Western Hemisphere really we thought in China to be specific. So we think there was a little bit of restock a bit. Again, the ability to restock is not very big in Acetyl Chain. These are for the most part liquid products and they go into tanks, and people have limited amount of tanks. So you're talking about the difference between people holding 30 days of inventory versus 20. So it was a small amount that went into restock. I don't think it will be meaningful as we go forward in terms of affecting overall demand for our products. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the progress in 2020. I guess apologies if I missed this earlier, but you're getting to round 250 to 275 or so for Q1. And I think you have some comments, as it relates to EM that Q2 and Q3 would be better and Q4 looks like Q1. So your EPS guidance for the full year is $9.50 to $10. I just -- are you calling for a Q2 Q3 level of EPS that's below Q1? Maybe you can just help us square that out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think, look, I think the real -- the swing factor here is really acetyl. Acetyl for Q1, we're saying it's going to be at or above $225 million. If we look going forward, as I said, I think acetyl will be more on that 170 to 200 range, which is the more normalized range. Again, EM will probably be slightly up in second and third quarter, but we do expect that drop in acetyl. So that's how we get to the $9.50 to $10. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, great. And then just as a follow up on the capital allocation side, you obviously have relatively low leverage; you've got a lot of opportunities in front of you both organic and inorganic. And you already laid out your priorities on buybacks. So I'm just curious are there any other potential asset sales that you're evaluating or divestments that would maybe give you a little bit more firepower on the buyback side? And maybe we can just discuss that. Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I would just say we constantly reevaluate our portfolio. There I would also tell you, though, there's nothing meaningfully out there and from gaining more firepower. I mean, we have quite a lot at the moment. We don't think that's going to be a factor in what we pursue in terms of M&A. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. Lori, are you able to share Acetyl Chain utilization rates by region. Lori Ryerkerk : I'm sorry. I wasn't quite clear. Utilization rates for acetic acid are acetyl. Matthew Blair : Yes. For your acetyl business by region. Lori Ryerkerk : I'm not sure I have it exactly by region. I can talk a little bit about China and maybe globally. So if we look at the fourth quarter, for example, both China and global acidic acid utilization was up about 5% from the previous quarter. And again, that was based on higher demand not because of higher outages. And if you look at what that translates to, that really was kind of low 80s in China. And remember, there's a lot of capacity in China that doesn't get actually run to a city gas that's fits on the books. And in the global, we saw actually the globe utilization crossing over kind of even into that low 90% range a couple of different times during the quarter. As we deal into the first quarter, we're seeing kind of the same -- the same level of utilizations both in China and in the globe. Scott Richardson :  Yes, Matthew the global number is really important number. I mean these are global markets product can move all over. And so that is really what drives things really in the short and long term is what's happening with global utilization. Lori Ryerkerk : But I think it's probably fair to say that anything that's based on US Gulf Coast natural gas is running at 100% if they're mechanically capable of doing so. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] with Jefferies. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one on the EPS guidance. When you're looking at the numbers, like what do you see upside or downside to those numbers? Like is it a pricing thing? Or is it volume? And how much of that depends on a faster or slower rollout of the vaccine? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think for Q1 and for the full year, obviously the upside comes if we continue to see strong demand in acetic acid, even above say where we are today. Or if we were to see significant supply outages in acetic acid that would certainly be an upside to both the quarter and to the year. I think the obvious biggest challenge on the downside is what you laid out in terms of COVID is do the markets lose confidence? Do we see automakers, for example, shut down again for two months that would be the biggest downside? The vaccine rolling out helps, I think in that area of confidence and also making sure we have enough employees who are well to run plants around the globe. As I said earlier, it is a downside. We're not baking that in because quite frankly, we're not seeing that behavior from our customers. What we're seeing if people have demand, people want to run; people are back at normal buying patterns. So unless we see a significant change from where we've been today on Covid; we think that's a manageable downside risk. Operator : I'd like to hand it back to Brandon Ayache for closing remarks. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. As usual, we are around after the call. If you have any further questions, Doug, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to, Brandon Ayache, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Brandon, please go ahead. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Senior Director of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its first quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open it up for your questions. Kevin, please go ahead and open the line. Operator : Thanks. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now live. John Roberts : Thanks and congratulations on the upside to the \u2013 upside guidance, I guess, you gave back at the end of March. Lori, you sourced methanol in Texas during the quarter to restart your acetic acid capacity early. I think, methanol was really tight as well. So, how did you do that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, John. I would have to say our folks were very proactive. I mean, we saw the weather coming, it was predicted. We anticipated we would need to shutdown. We anticipated that there would be tightness in the market. And because we're out in the market, every single day looking at what's available, our folks were able to go out there and kind of really sourced that material, even before we went into the freeze. And look, we sourced quite a few materials going into the freeze in anticipation of shutdown, and wanting to make sure that we could supply our customers as best we can, recognizing that we thought there would be some disruptions. But I think it's just really a factor of the model and the fact that we're always in the market. So, we don't need to activate a new team to go do anything. When we see something like this coming, we're already out there taking advantage of what's there in the market. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is actually Mike sitting in for Bob. Lori, just a question for you. Can you speak to what happened over the past month that improved visibility, or I'd say increased your confidence to raise a full-year adjusted EPS guidance again by another $1.75 midpoint to midpoint? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If we go back to Investor Day, although we had the Investor Day what's the 25th of March. We actually kind of locked in our guidance and our numbers about a week in advance of that, let's call it mid-March. And at the time that we locked in our guidance for Investor Day, we were really seeing some softening in methanol prices in China and we were anticipating even on the back of Uri, and we were anticipating that trend might continue. Now, having said that, we also had some uncertainty around Uri. We had some uncertainty around how \u2013 what we would want off, what we wouldn't, what the total of those would be. And in fact, we had some of that baked into the guidance, some of which slipped into second quarter because it came with invoicing, timing and it came with materials and inventory, et cetera. But then what we really saw is right around the time of Investor Day, we saw prices take off again in China and really versus where we had been in March, which was around, call it, $700, $750. Really in the last many weeks, we've seen prices greatly increased and now we're sometimes over $1,000. And it's not just acetic acid, but it's also the fact that them and other derivative pricing has also followed, something which hasn't always happened in times of high pricing before. And during a period where methanol pricing is high, but not as high as say, we saw in 2018. So, a lot of factors coming together that have really given us very, very healthy margins in the Acetyl Chain going forward, as well as the continued strength and growth we see in engineered material. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, I mean, when I look at the new full-year guidance of $12.50 to $13.50 and kind of considering the significant strength that we've seen in the first-half, it doesn't seem like it takes much to get there. And I mean, even if Acetyls are, say, toppy in the second quarter and earnings fall back to maybe that first quarter level around $3.50-ish for the third quarter, then you would only need about $2 of fourth quarter earnings per share to reach that guidance. So, I guess I'm trying to better understand, what have you baked into the second-half? And maybe why won't earnings be a bit more resilient during the back-half of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think we\u2019re always \u2013 we'd like to guide based on what we have visibility into. We don't really have any visibility into the second-half at this moment in time. We expect continued growth in EM after a flat second quarter. We do expect continued growth in the third and fourth quarter for EM. But in Acetyl, we expect to start to see some moderation in pricing as we get towards the end of the second quarter. We expect that will continue to moderate through the third quarter and be back to more typical levels in the fourth quarter. And that really was the basis for the guidance that we gave was those assumptions about what would happen in the second-half. And obviously, it may be different. We have to make assumptions around methanol pricing, crude pricing, everything that's happening there. But that was the basis for the guidance that we provided. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Lori, you mentioned some outages in China that could be pushed into Q2, plus the asset base there is getting older as well. So how are you thinking about outages not just maybe in Q2, but longer-term in China, both planned and unplanned? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so there was a number of outages we were aware of in China that were planned in the first quarter. A lot of those are pushed to the second quarter based on the strength of the market in the first quarter. Look, some of those, they may be able to push to the third quarter, we don't know. But at some point, those outages will need to happen. We know elsewhere in the world, there are some outages that are taking place in the second quarter. And it's just a big factor right now, with the tightness of the market when people choose to take planned outages. And, of course, unplanned outages are \u2013 can also be a factor as we go forward. But we won't know what those are. But we do know there will need to be some outages in the second quarter. Again, some may get pushed to the third quarter. We're just happy to say we took the opportunity last year to take all of our turnarounds and necessary steps and aiming back moving the VAM turnaround in Clear Lake from second quarter taking it during the forced downtime with the winter storm, so that we're able to run fully going forward. David Begleiter : Got it. And just the inventories, how long will it take to rebuild inventories at the customer level do you think? Lori Ryerkerk : If that's really the basis for what we're thinking about acetyl pricing, we think it's clearly going to take into the summer. So through second quarter moving into third quarter to really start inventory levels, start returning to near normal levels. And again, that is going to depend on what outages people take, is there any unplanned outages then that sort of time. But I would assume it's going to take into the third quarter before we see people back at near normal levels of inventory. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Maybe just a question on the infrastructure bill that's out there it's been proposed, as obviously has some ideas about how the corporate tax rate environment is going to evolve. So, I don't know if you have any thoughts around that or if you're any particular provisions about it within it that are concerning or the change in the guilty provision would impact you or just \u2013 maybe just any general thoughts on what could happen to your tax rate? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks, Vincent. I think, as we look at it, it is still too early for us to really understand exactly where things will land. But we are looking at each component of the various proposals that have been rumored right now. And there \u2013 I think there are ways at which I think with our global network that we will work to mitigate, whatever may come about. And I do think, going back even a year ago, we did call out that we would expect to see our effective tax rate possibly move up a few 100 basis points over the next several years. And I wouldn't come off of that right now. I think as we look out a couple of years, regardless of what happens with U.S. tax changes, I think we still believe the changes to our effective tax rate will be in that range. Vincent Andrews : Okay, that's helpful. And Lori, maybe just a question in EM. You haven't really seen any negative impact from the chip shortage in autos yet. But your guidance seems to imply that you're anticipating that there'll be some fall off. And I'm just curious, what the trigger for that is going to be just given you haven't seen it yet? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Vincent, that's exactly what we're assuming in the second quarter. I mean, we really have not seen much impact from the chip shortage yet, again, primarily because we've been in luxury vehicles and platforms like trucks and SUVs, which have been prioritized by the automakers and not affected as much. Now as this drags on, we are starting to see, and you probably saw some announcements by some of the OEMs this week that they are curtailing production for a period of time because of chips that we do think that will start to affect us in the second quarter. There's also some resin shortages, quite frankly, in the industry that is also impacting the automakers. And you might see something into that around that, especially around nylon and some other materials.  So, we do expect to see some impact in auto for us in second quarter, which is why we're calling second quarter flat on EM. But we also expect most of issues to be resolved through the quarter and back to more normal levels by third quarter. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thanks very much. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now live. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. If we think about the delta from your original guidance with the midpoint in $9.75, going up $3.25 to $13. If you just back that through your shares and let's say a 14% tax rate, that's about $440 million of EBITDA. Is that a fair way to think about it? And if it is, what's the delta in free cash flow? Because my guess is there are some more puts and takes, working capital probably needs a little bit more cash with higher prices. But, if we could work off that $440 million, if that's the right number increment, how would that flow through the cash flow statement then? Scott Richardson : Yes. Duffy, I think the easiest way I think to look at is originally we said, we're going to do about $500 million of repurchases this year, and now we're saying we're going to do an incremental $200 million to $300 million over that. I think, we \u2013 that really is tied to that incremental cash flow that we have this year versus what we had originally planned on. And you highlighted where the delta is, it's really on the working capital build. And so it really is just a timing thing. We think that recovery of that, call it, $450 million of EBITDA, the balance that we weren't generating free cash flow, we would expect to collect as we get into next year. So a lot will just depend on how working capital develops for the balance of the year. But right now, our projections are is we will have a working capital build. And it's driven by the fact that pricing is moving up, but also that raw materials are moving up. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. And then maybe just one on the strategy side. Would you anticipate any competitors announcing a major greenfield acetic acid plant this year? And are your customers pushing you to do something larger there? Obviously, you had the issue of Clear Lake before the freeze even. And I think some customers just said that, there's so much riding on that one plant. They would like to see some diversification. Can you just talk about your footprint going forward on acetic acid? And do you think others will announce builds this year? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, I can't really talk to what others will do. I have no idea. We do know there is some capacity coming up mid-year here in acetic acid in China. So, certainly that will help China. We are, of course, doubling our capacity in Clear Lake, so the equivalent of adding 1,300,000 ton facility in Clear Lake. So, another world-scale capacity facility. Look, Clear Lake is the cheapest producing acetic acid in the world. I think customers are happy to have that kind of stability in the Gulf Coast. And I do \u2013 I expect others to announce maybe do they ultimately get build? That's always a bigger question. I think, no one's going to build on what they see as a surge in pricing, it really has to be a sustainable level of pricing. And I mean, look, you can't just go put an acetic acid plant anywhere. You need to have the access to methanol or some form of syngas. You need to have access to CO2. You need RCO. sorry, you need to have access to hydrogen. So this is not something that you can easily say, I'm just going to go put a plant somewhere. You need to be in industrial area. You need to have access. And frankly, it's what keeps acetic acid plants from being built kind of everywhere in the world is these other components. So, what I would say is there may be an announcement, I don't know what others will do. But it's also three to four years kind of minimum before anybody could actually have one online. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess, first off on the velocity of pricing that you're seeing in the AC segment across your major commodities. How does that compare to the 2018 peak? And then related to that, entry levels across multiple supply chain seem to be very low based on commentary, that's probably in the earnings season and prior to that. And so even as supplies sort of gets rebased, higher post the first half disruption, do you think it will be at a higher level for longer sort of dynamic relative to the duration and spike that you saw in 2018? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Let me talk about that a little bit, Ghansham. We of course do expect a record Q2 in acetyl, as we laid out in our documents. And I think it's really based on a couple things. I mean, one is we have had a significant lift in foundational earnings, even since 2018. So we've added RDP, we've got other capacity around emulsion, and VAM, through low-cost bottlenecks. We've continued to refine the model. And frankly, we've just gotten better and better every year about how to use the optionality available to us, and how to really flex our model. We've also seen improving industry dynamics. Acetyl is growing a couple -- a little bit over GDP every year. We haven't seen any major capacity addition. So it's a better industry dynamic as supplied or supply demand chain. If you look at 2018, 2018 was very much supply-driven. Inventory and demands were pretty much at normal levels. But starting at the end of '17, you saw a whole series of shut down in the industry, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which really drove a supply shortage, and drove that price up to that $700 to $800 a ton. Remember, that was that methanol around $450 or so, crude was around $80 right then. 2021 is fundamentally different is that we went into this, it's both the supply and the demand problem. I mean, we've seen really robust demand since at least the fourth quarter of '20, as the world moved into recovery. And again, not just in acetic acid, but also in VAM and emulsion, which is a little different than 2018, which is really focused on acetic acid. And our inventories were very low as we went into this year into 2021. And that was true globally. So it's already a really tight supply demand market. And then we had winter storm Uri, which we lost three of the four large producers in the U.S. for a considerable period of time. I mean, a minimum of about four weeks, as everything had to get back up and running. And we've done that, but we still haven't seen methanol prices go way up. I mean, methanol is still around $350, crude is $60. So, we have a larger margin. Now, that's partially offset by higher precious metal prices. So there is some offset there. But fundamentally, this is I would say this is a deeper disconnect between supply and demand than we had in '18. And that's why we're seeing record level pricing in China that reflects that. So I do think there's the possibility this is going to be longer and bigger for a period of time than 2018 was. Again, it will just depend on how fast recovery happens around the world, the demand levels stay up, what happens with methanol pricing, what happens with precious metal pricing, all that will play into. But I do definitely think the probability. And what we baked into our revised outlook is that, this continues through Q2 and we continue to see somewhat elevated pricing through Q3, as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. How have you been handling the inflation in ethylene prices in the United States? I think spot ethylene is maybe $0.64 a pound. Are you able to buy much, much more at contract? Or is this an inflationary factor that you're feeling? Lori Ryerkerk : Jeff, I mean, we're certainly feeling the inflationary factor. I think the good news is we anticipated this coming back in fourth quarter of last year already, and started moving prices and engineering materials to reflect this. And of course, that price also may still get reflected more quickly. So, although it is an inflation pressure, we've been able to push that through in our pricing, and basically maintain the same level of variable margins. Jeff Zekauskas : And then for my follow-up, can you -- so your adjusted tax rate is 14%. And you have this tremendously profitable U.S. operation. How do you keep your tax rates so low? Why isn't your tax rate higher? Scott Richardson : Yes. Jeff, I think it's important to remember, we still have a fairly sizable portion of our earnings that come through from our equity affiliates. And that comes in at an after tax rate. And so, it is important to keep that in mind and that is one of the factors for the tax rate remaining low. And I do think after U.S. tax reform, it has given us certainly some advantages from the U.S. side of our operations. But we really are a global operation, which about a third of our sales in the U.S., a third in Europe, and a third in Asia. And so, that rate has been able to remain very low, because of that balance. Now, what you're seeing is we had originally guided to an effective tax rate of 13% for this year. But with the elevated earnings we're seeing in some of our higher tax jurisdictions, particularly China this year, we actually see that moving up, and that's why we raised that guidance to 14%. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. John McNulty : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. In the acetyl chain, how should we think about the risk of any demand disruption? It seems like there's a lot of other commodities that are up as well. Have you seen any demand disruption at this point? And how should we think about that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, we really haven't seen any demand disruption, John. There is always the possibility, of course, vinyl acetate could go to acetate. But I mean, that's not a cheap switch, nor that one people are going to do in the short-term. So at this point in time, we've really been just trying to focus on keeping our contract customers supplied with what they absolutely need at this point in time. And we haven't seen any signs yet of demand destruction because of switching to other commodities or for other reasons. In fact, we just see demand continuing to strengthen across the globe. John McNulty : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, the follow up question would just be given the severity and proliferation of all the outages that we've seen, have you seen a flurry of interest from customers looking to kind of partner with you in a more meaningful way, and maybe willing to pay higher prices for the stability or the surety of supply? And like, how should we think about that, as it plays out over potentially the next few years in terms of stabilizing your platform even more? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, we certainly have seen, I'd say across all of our businesses. We have seen customers more interested in contract arrangements versus just spot arrangements, because quite frankly, we've prioritized our contract customers as we've had shortages both in acetyl and in EM. Those customers that we have contracts with, we have worked very closely to make sure we could get them, again, not necessarily all the volume they wanted, but the volume they absolutely needed to keep running so that they wouldn't have any plant shutdowns or outages. For those non-contract customers, we haven't been able to do that. And so, certainly we see that driving more people into wanting to have contract type arrangements that we've had in the past. John McNulty : Thanks very much for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now live. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning. Hassan Ahmed : Lori, just wanted to sort of revisit the back-half guidance, specifically on the Acetyl Chain side of things. Obviously, conscious the fact that you guys just have visibility call it through June. But, just in hearing some of the remarks that you made, turnarounds, certain turnarounds being pushed into Q3 call it then the impact of Uri. Obviously, the fact that inventories are fairly lean even pre the winter storm and they got even tighter and it will take us through call it Q3 just to normalize inventory levels. And then, there's the whole back selling of orders side of things and the like. So long story short, I mean, is there a fairly high probability that this moderation in supply demand fundamentals and pricing that you're looking for within Acetyl Chain could actually surprise to the upside? Just keeping all of these sort of moving parts in mind. Lori Ryerkerk : Look, there's always that possibility. I mean, can we put out guidance based on where we -- kind of our assumptions about what we think is going to happen, especially through the third quarter, I think, is the real question here. Obviously, look there's new capacity coming on in the third quarter in China. So we've baked that into acetyl, that should help stabilize the supply demand situation there. But, if we had -- if we saw extended turnarounds, if we saw unplanned outages, I mean, clearly, that could extend this period of higher pricing for longer, and could result in an upside. It's always a possibility for sure. But this is our best outlook. And you have to remember, we still do expect seasonality in fourth quarter. I mean, seasonality is pretty typical, we even saw it last year, especially in acetyl, as you see, the construction market generally ramped down a bit because of weather and other constraints in the fourth quarter. So you should still be baking in some seasonality in the fourth quarter back to a more typical level. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, understood. Very helpful. And as a follow-up on the longer-term side of things, obviously, we've been hearing about the Biden's sort of greenhouse emission reduction plans, as much as 50% by 2030. How do you feel that you guys are set up to execute, call it in line with that? And how you guys are thinking about sort of the CapEx associated with that, in the run up to sort of call it 2030? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Unfortunately, there's not really enough details out about the plan to know what that really means in terms of how it\u2019s measured, can you get credit for materials that you make that help, for example, for light weighting, and things that help to reduce other people's greenhouse gas emissions. I mean, let's be honest, on the one hand, it's a real opportunity for us, because many of the products that we make will be needed by others to meet that kind of a commitment. Even in the construction industry, if you think about acetyl, and how much of that goes into weather proofing and insulation and things like that, which would also be necessary. It could be a huge opportunity for us. As far as reducing our greenhouse gas emissions of our own facility that really has to do with heat recovery, lower furnace firing, uses of alternative energy, like our solar contract at Clear Lake, as well as recovery of -- venting of CO2, which in like, we're doing it Clear Lake, maybe there's options to recycle back into our operation. So, I don't know. We don't know yet, is it possible to reduce our own footprint by that amount. Again, we need to see the details of the plan. But I would say in general, it's probably more of an opportunity for us than a threat at this point in time. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful, Lori. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now live. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Good morning. Let me just follow up on that second-half outlook question. The pace of buybacks is set to slow down in the second-half. Is that more a function of that lack of visibility in the second-half? And is that something that you may revisit, when we -- depending on how the results come in? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think what we were trying to indicate is, we'll have done kind of $500 million of buybacks in the first-half. As we see our financial outlook improving for the full-year, we basically showed that additional cash available to us as buybacks to make sure that the shareholders will benefit from kind of the additional earnings this year. If we have higher earnings, I would anticipate we'll put those into buybacks. But it still doesn't change our desire to do significant M&A this year and next year. And remember, we still have a billion even after these buybacks we will still have a billion dollars on the balance sheet in order to put towards meaningful M&A. So I think it really was more of an indication, if you will, and our belief that we want to make sure that the shareholders benefit from this increased earnings outlook we're seeing from this year. And so we've selected that as buybacks. Frank Mitsch : Got you. Very helpful. And I was struck by the commentary in the prepared remarks regarding having to airlift materials because of the block in the Suez, which begs the question, you broke down the impact of the winter storm and what have you, in terms of, I guess, $40 million of repairs and $35 million of higher raw costs, et cetera. But what about logistics? And, because obviously, you have to spend more on logistics, what sort of headwind did you face on logistics in the first quarter? And what's your expectation here in the second quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I don't have an exact number on that, Frank. What I would say is, while this was a very unusual situation with Uri. I would also say we work very fluidly and flexibly to always supply our customers. So these are all things we pride in one form or another. We probably did more of them in a short period of time now. But I mean, they're just baked into our cost of supply. So I don't have a really good sense of is it $10 million $20 million, I don't know what we spent in addition, during Uri. But, definitely more than typical. But we always work very hard to supply our customers. Scott Richardson : Yes. Frank, and I would just add, I think we were in a pretty tight situation, even going into Uri. And so this has made it even tighter. So our teams are really working on getting creative not just for the second quarter, but we think this could continue into the second-half. Logistics are going to be tight, probably for the balance of the year. So it's something we're just trying to stay ahead of. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now live. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning. P.J. Juvekar: Lori, you talked about the big green project of making methanol from recycled CO2 at Clear Lake. Where is the CO2 coming from? And what is the all-in cost of methanol from recycled CO2 versus let's say based on natural gas? Lori Ryerkerk : So the methanol -- sorry, the CO2 P.J. is coming from our facilities and our partner facilities in Clear Lake. So there are vent streams of operating facilities that are high CO2 and fairly pure. So that's what makes this very affordable for us at Clear Lake, is we can take those streams, further compress them, further purify them and add them directly to our synthesis gas at fairway, where it's converted into methanol. So what makes this really attractive for us is, we have spare synthesis capacity currently a fair way. We have a source of hydrogen available to us to ramp that unit up from the hydrogen grid industrial grid in that area. And we have the availability of high purity CO2 vent streams available to us. So with that, basically, the cost of producing methanol from recycled CO2 is really comparable to our normal cost of producing methanol from natural gas. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then, there were a couple of questions on the Biden plan. And Exxon Mobil just recently announced a massive CCS project in Texas, or on the Gulf Coast on back of that Biden plan. Is there something you could do there to participate as either as a supplier of CO2 or as an off taker of CO2 there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. It's not something we've looked at yet, P.J. I mean, this project is several years down the road yet, quite frankly. And the real question is, what is the purity of the CO2 streams? How much you have to cost to clean it up? I mean, I like the idea of recycling CO2 more than just sticking it in the ground to be fair, but you have to look at the economics of it and how that would. But this is clearly something we're looking at, at our facilities or other facilities around the world, which is, are there other opportunities to do this, to use this technology in a cost-effective way. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Mike Sison : Hey, good morning. Really nice start to the year. Lori, when you think about the Acetyl Chain and I know it's a little bit early. But you guys talked about $900 million to $1 billion in adjusted EBIT for '23. I guess, investors should think about that for '22 to reset back to let's say $900 million or so. Is that the right way to look at it? And if so, what do you have in growth in EM and maybe cost savings other areas to potentially offset the year-over-year delta in '22 versus '21? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look '21 to '22 is going to be a difficult comparison, assuming we kind of go to normalized earnings, because we have had that surge up in acetyl. We really consider our acetyl foundational levels still $800 now moving towards $900 over the next two years. So I think that's the right way to think about that, based on the capacity ads and other things that we've had. We expect, we'll continue to see continued productivity. I would assume that's in there at about, $0.25 EPS kind of year-on-year. So we'll continue to see that to offset. EM is going to continue to grow kind of at that 10% CAGR or higher every year, so that will also be in there to offset. And of course, I think the other thing timing is of course uncertain, but the other thing is that will be important for us over the next two years is, M&A and having M&A to also complement that organic growth strategy that we have for our businesses. Mike Sison : Got it. And then just on the second-half for EM 7% volume growth in first quarter, obviously 2Q is going to be normally strong volume growth. But what's sort of underpinning the outlook for the second-half for EM? Are you going to be at that kind of 10% - 11% double digit growth? And if you are what's going to drive that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we're really saying for EM is, second quarter we think will be flat to first quarter, because we are expecting some softening in auto based on the chip shortage and the resin shortage. But we are seeing recovery of medical, and not just the implants. We think implants will continue to need through the end of the year to really get back to full rate. But in other areas of medical, we are making really good progress. So for example, for our diabetes applications in medical, we're seeing really significant growth in those areas going forward. So just to give you an example. So our diabetes applications were up 50% from first quarter of last year to first quarter of this year. So that growth in other elements of medical, other elements of 5G and electronics and industrial applications, those will continue to grow and support that kind of 10% CAGR year-on-year growth going forward. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew DeYoe from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Matthew DeYoe : Thanks. The breathing guide on EM is pretty impressive. And seems to indicate the $550 million number you gave just like two weeks ago for the full-year is already pretty stale. So did something change in EM? Was that just conservatism? Is there something perhaps about the back-half that we're not necessarily picking up on? I'm just kind of going off normal seasonality and your 2Q guide and actually rates and stuff like that? Lori Ryerkerk : No. I think, look, we've seen continued good recovery. At the time of Investor Day, we did have concerns about automotive, although we haven't seen the impact of that time. I think we will see those concerns develop in Q2. Now we do see an end of that insight as well. So we do see Q3 strengthening and Q4. But, as we get further into the year, as we get better visibility, as we have visibility now into the June timeframe, we really see that continued growth. And despite the resurgence of COVID, which is kind of the other concern, we've called out, we really haven't seen that impacting our demand numbers in any part of the world, despite some very serious issues around the globe with COVID. So, I think we are getting more confident in that $550 million number and above going forward, and so very, very confident in that growth rate, I just called out. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. And the $400 million EBIT number, it's a pretty big number. It kind of implies to me that you're pulling product out of VAM and selling it into acid. Is it true? I mean, I think in the past, you talked about pushing more and more downstream and we're 50% to 55% of your acid then move down to VAM. Did you move backwards on that? And have you been more opportunistic and just selling into acid and subsequently has that tightened VAM as a result? Lori Ryerkerk : Not really. I mean, the interesting thing about this surge in pricing for acetyl, which is different than 2018 is we've seen the price hold not just for acid, which is what happened in 2018. And in fact, in 2018, we did move a lot of stuff back to acid and sold it as acid to the market. What's different here is we are seeing that price pull through in VAM and emulsion as well, because of the really strong end markets for those products. So, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me. But I would say we've not made that shift back to acid in the same way, I think because we have seen pull through in the pricing into the downstream derivatives as well. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Lori, just to follow up on acetic acid. In your prepared remarks last night, it's evident that you plan to run your whole network very hard. The one exception to that was acetic at Clear Lake where you said you're at 80% due to limited availability of certain third-party raw materials. Can you expand on that? What is constrained right now upstream of acid? And timing wise, when would you expect to be able to run fill out at Clear Lake? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So look, a number of our third-party suppliers of raw materials had issues during the freeze, some of them have had to take turn around in order to properly repair their equipment. We were down around 70%, we're now up at 80% as they fully bring facilities back online. We really expect by the end of the second quarter to be fully out of this maybe even a little bit before and back to 100%. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then I had a follow-up for Scott on free cash flow. You indicated in the prepared remarks, your goal for this year is $900 million or better. Having sorted through our model last night I was frankly coming up with a larger number. And so, I was wondering if you might refresh us a bit on CapEx and exactly how much working capital we are penciling in at this point? And also, whether or not you have any call it extraordinary items beyond the $100 million settlement with the European Commission? Scott Richardson : Yes. Kevin, I think the simple answer on extraordinary items is nothing more than the $100 million that was already baked in. CapEx is we're planning on a number between $500 million and $550 million for the year. And a lot of that will just depend upon when expenses come in from a timing standpoint. We inherent in that number, something towards the higher end of that range. And then the balances are working capital build, as I stated earlier. Now, I think it was Duffy who called out, incremental $450 million or so of EBITDA versus our original guide at the beginning of the year. And that's in the right ballpark. And we do expect to collect that as cash is just likely a portion of that is going to slip into 2022, because of that working capital build. Kevin McCarthy : I see. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is now live. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You had quite healthy sequential improvements in engineered materials. Could you try to walk through this sequential bridge in earnings and understand the benefit of the baguettes, such as volume leverage, positive mix? And maybe is there an uplift in less differentiated polymers where supply demand may have been tighter? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, let me try to take that. Aleksey, if I understand your question correctly, so if you look at kind of fourth quarter to first quarter, yes, we did have a significant uplift in earnings, I mean, almost doubled our earnings in engineered materials. So we had about a 6% increase in volume, which I would just say it's continued growth in demand really, across all sectors, really any we saw automotive returning to kind of pre-COVID levels joining the U.S. and Asia that had gotten there in fourth quarter. We thought industrial continue to go up. And we did see continued recovery in our medical, again, not just in plants, but other areas of medical now that because of the programs that we put in place are really starting to show up. So that was about a 6% increase. Then we had about a 6% increase in price. And I would say you know about half of that were proactive pricing measures that we took last year to get in front of the raw materials. And then about half of that was really product mix. So again, more medical more higher in premium palm application, really pushing the molecules that we did have into our more premium products. And then we also had a bit of a help from, -- we didn't have a palm turnaround, because we took that fourth quarter of last year and IPH, that was kind of another $30 million uplift. They are not having the palm turn around in this quarter. And then we had another about $10 million uplift from affiliate really kind of across the board in affiliate. So I mean, those are the big factors that really accounted for that pretty dramatic uplift that we saw in EM. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you, Lori. And a quick follow-up. You mentioned disruptions in nylon and PBT supplies. How long do you think this could last? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think, we do think they're going to continue through the second quarter. And we start to resolve themselves as we move into the third quarter. Aleksey Yefremov : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I'll just start on the longer-term outlook for acetyl. You guys have announced the capacity additions. Couple years ago, there was some rationalization in VAM in Europe. How do you see supply and demand, I guess, in the Acetyl Chain over the next couple years? Do you expect further additions as well from the industry? Or would there be opportunities for consolidation? And I guess maybe if you could also address, you've noted some strength in end markets. Do you believe those are structural or just a little bit more near-term cyclical developments? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, longer-term, I believe there have been structural improvement in terms of demand for Acetyl Chain products. Again, lot of it goes into construction and infrastructure, but paintings, coatings, packaging. I think the move towards people having everything shipped to their home in boxes is not going to change anytime soon. So, I think a lot of those sectors are seeing lasting increases in demand, even paints and coatings, I mean, why that maybe can be a bit more cyclical. Again, I think what's happening with infrastructure bills and desire to reduce energy usage, you see a lot more going into insulation and exterior coatings and things to further weatherproof existing buildings, as well as better materials and new buildings. So I think we are seeing a structural improvement in demand for acetyl products. I do expect we'll see some capacity come online, I mean, probably other than what we've announced not a lot in the near-term, again, because these things take a little while to build. But, if you go out, four years what I expect to see some additional capacity as yes, assuming that continues. That said, I also expect that, especially in China, new environmental regulations, other safety regulation may lead to some consolidation of capacity in China and certain parts of the world. So, I don't think this pricing level is going to continue forever. And I've talked about that already. But I do think we should continue to see fairly healthy margins going forward in acetyl based on those changes. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks for that. And just as a follow up then, you provided kind of a $13 or $14 outlook for a couple years from now. But you've also mentioned that, you do have some plans for M&A this year. So maybe you can just elaborate on what you're seeing on the M&A front. And, if that does kind of now factor in a little bit more concretely into your longer-term outlook, and maybe push you up into the $15 level or so? How would you think about that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think we laid it out in Investor Day. What we laid out in the Investor Day did not assume any M&A. It just assumed everything was share repurchases, because that was the easiest way to model it in. But I mean, look, we're very active right now and looking at M&A as we have been. I think the M&A market is opening up. We see more parties interested in discussing M&A. We see more things being surfaced. So, look, I'd say we're hopeful, we're not making anything in yet in terms of M&A, but we're certainly hopeful that over the next 18 to 24-months, we will be able to do some form of meaningful M&A. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now live. Matthew Blair : Hey, Lori, congrats on the strong EM results in Q1. I was hoping you could just simply rank your top three end markets right now on EM, in terms of just overall demand strength? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so probably electronics would be the number one in terms of demand strength. I would say, medical is probably number two in terms of -- it's not our largest market, but in terms of the strength of the growth that we're seeing for medical and pharma is number two. And then auto, despite what we expect in second quarter is probably number three in terms of continued growth in the future. Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. And then, we're seeing this huge spot VAM in acetic acid crisis in China. But I just want to make sure I understand your comments from before. Are you saying that those high prices are a result of current outages? Or, hey, we have high prices now and be on the lookout for future outages that were deferred from Q1? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think the high prices we're seeing now is started with the high demand we saw coming out of the fourth quarter, and the tightness of the market is this aggravated by winter storm Uri. So, normally, for example, Europe is an import market. Normally, everybody ships from the U.S., which is the lowest cost location to Europe to meet the demand there for acetic acid but more importantly, VAM and emulsions. If you look at then hurricane Uri, with nothing coming out of the U.S., everything started coming out of China, and other parts of Asia. So that really kept, that's really what's been driving, I think the higher pricing in China and Asia is demand there, as well as exporting now into Europe, going forward. Because we know now all the plants are running again in the U.S., they're all coming back up to full capacity. Going forward, I think it will still be tight, but I think it could be tightened further, depending on the timing of now the China turnarounds that need to occur, as well as any unplanned outages that could happen anywhere around the globe. Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. So, in the EM, do you have a sense for how the rate of new projects and the duration of projects is affected in an inflationary or more volatile raw material environment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, we haven't seen the raw material environment really impacting the rate of new projects. I mean, in fact, we talked about this a little bit of Investor Day, but our project model continues to be extremely productive, especially with a focus on the growth program that we added 18-months or so ago. So if you look at just say, Q1 '20 versus Q1 '21, we've actually increased the number of projects by 13%. So the number of projects won by 13%. And if you look at the value of those projects, that's more than a 20% growth year-on-year in terms of the value of the projects won. So I would say, the project model is very healthy, it is giving excellent results. We are getting a lot of value. And it is the thing that is supporting this greater than 10% CAGR growth we're looking at over the next few years. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Scott Richardson : Kevin, let's make the next question our last one, please? Operator : Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Investment Research. Your line is now live. Jaideep Pandya : Thank you. And thanks a lot for the comments yesterday was very helpful. First question is really on VAM and your ultra-high molecular weight going into battery separators. Can you just tell us Lori, how much of palm is in ICE versus EV? And then what sort of growth do you expect in your ultra-polyethylene as EV penetration sort of goes up and the wet end capacity in separators comes through? That's my first question. And the second question really is around acetic acid VAM. What is really the current sort of payback for any current player or a new player that wants to enter this market, considering all the things that you've described off the market which point to fundamentally better demand supply balance than it was maybe in the previous cycles? Thanks a lot. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Let me see if I can get that. So in terms of palm, I think if you look at palm, the difference between palm in an IC and then in an EV is not much difference at all. It's really other components that add. I mean, the difference between polymer content is very large between IC and EV. But for palm specifically, pretty flat between the two. Now, if you look at it, GUR, I mean, GUR we've seen really significant growth over the last few years, really supporting the expansions that we're putting in place. So if you look at, say, libs growth, lithium ion battery separator growth from '19 to '20, that was up 25%. And then if you look at between '20 and '21, it's going even be above 25% growth year-on-year. So huge demand for the ultra-high molecular weight material for lithium ion battery separators. We are able to expand into that capacity at very low capital costs. So, we're continuing to do so and that's why we announced the Bishop GUR plant, which will start up here next year. And then GUR plant to follow in Europe that will start up in 2024. And then in terms of acetic acid VAM, I mean, God, that's a really hard question. I mean, if you're expanding acetic acid in VAM which is what we have been doing, I would say you can get -- and you have good capital efficiency, you can get really good payout. Let's say kind of nominally three-year kind of payout. I think if you're talking about greenfield, our brand-new build, again, everybody's economics are different. But I'm going to say you're probably talking closer to a 10-year payout, even at pretty good, maybe seven years if you're really, really capital efficient. But, again, it's the infrastructure it takes to build acetic acid, you have to have hydrogen, you have to have methanol, you have to have CO. Unless you're in an industrial area, this gets really, really expensive. And just the transport, the stuff moves around in stainless tanks. I mean, it's the transport, it is an expensive proposition for a new player to get into acetic acid and VAM. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to, Brandon, for any further or closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Kevin. We'd like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call for any further questions you might have. Kevin, please go ahead and close up the call at this time. Operator : Thank you. It does conclude today's teleconference or webcast. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce, Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Daryl. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its first quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open it up for your questions. Kevin, please go ahead and open the line. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes. Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter and a big raise. I guess two questions. First one Lori I think either on the Q4 call this year, the Q1 call, you talked about one meaningful slug of new acetic acid capacity hitting the market this year at a competitor and that was going to be around midyear as I recall. So what I just want to see have they been marketing that product? Is it producing and what impact that you see not have on the market or do you anticipate that having on the market? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so we do still expect that to hit if not started up yet. It hasn\u2019t hit the market yet. It's about 500,000 tons in China from Hawaii. So we do expect it to hit I would say -- it may contribute to moderation as we go forward in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, but if you think about it 500,000 tons just really a little bit over a year's growth, so probably won't have a significant impact in the market we're in today. Scott Richardson : Yeah and Debbie I think it's important to remember this is not a new player for the Chinese market. They have two plants already in the market. So it somebody's who is in the market is adding more capacity. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. And then just a follow-up, if you look obviously your guidance for the year has gone up a lot from earlier this year. When you think about your decision-making, your ratios, net debt to EBITDA, dividend payout based on earnings, how do you think about that change from where you started to where you are today? What's the right level to think about is something you would kind of call structural to make capital decisions also? What's the right level of profitability to think about? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think as we go forward, if we start thinking about 2022, really thinking about foundational level of earnings for as such [ph] kind of in the $900 million to $1 billion range growing into that range over the next two years, we're really thinking about engineer materials closer to $700 million and then if you add [indiscernible] on top of that, you get to the kind of that $750 million to $800 million range and then you think about acetic acid right around $60 million a quarter and so I think that would be kind of the right level. I'd consider those pretty foundational level of learning at this point in time. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Lori, in your prepared comments, you made some comments on China acetic acid pricing and how it progressed throughout the second quarter and into the third quarter. It that decline a function of purely a supply normalization or is demand in the region starting to moderate? I guess I am just trying to get its micro pulse in China in context of the narrative that it's in the market, but it's slowing in the region? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. So I think we're seeing some supply ability or -- of course it varies day by day but I think since supply stability as we come out of Yuri [ph] and Western Hemisphere, supply is a bit more stabilized. Now we have been in the period of higher turnaround of this Western hemisphere this last quarter. So we expect some of those plants to come back online. As some of you called out, there are some turnarounds happening in the third quarter in China, but I would say kind of within the normal level. So I think I'd say supply has certainly stabilized first quarter. But I would also say demand while it continues to be robust, we are seeing some pockets of lower demand potentially going forward with COVID and the Delta variant and especially in Southeast Asia. So I think it's a little bit of both. I think what's interesting though, is if you look at the moderation that was called out in China pricing, it's really a very slow moderation compared to what we saw say in 2018. And we think that is because it is demand driven as much as supply driven, whereas 18 months you've got the supply back it dropped very quickly. And if you look at recent prices, prices have been -- China been really stable, over the last call it week. And we think that's more indicative of the slow moderation we expect to see through the remainder of the year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the inventory rebuild, what phase of the rebuild are we in that current? And then also your comments on 4Q earnings seasonality being minimal? Can you just expand on that as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so inventory rebuild, I can say we're in the pre rebuild phase still. I mean, everybody is talking about wanting to rebuild, but we are not seeing volumes being rebuilt in the [indiscernible] supply chain or really in the EM supply chain as well. So I would say there is a desire to rebuild, but both businesses are still supply constrained not demand constrained. And so I'd say, we still have a long way to go on the rebuild. I would say, in fact our anticipation is that it will last well into 2022. And then sorry, your last question there. Your second part of your question, I just\u2026 Ghansham Panjabi : The 4Q earnings seasonality. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. And that's exactly the reason we're saying we expect less seasonality in 4Q, because we do expect as prices continue to moderate slowly, we will see people starting to rebuild as supply is available. So if you think for example about paints and coatings, right, that's a market where you typically see a good bit of seasonality in the fourth quarter, but we know our paints and coatings, customers have no inventory. So we anticipate they will use the fourth quarter to rebuild their supplies in order to be ready for another spring and painting season. So we really are expecting much less seasonality in acetic and then slightly, we usually see some drop-off in the Western hemisphere in the fourth quarter and for all the reasons because we've been supply constrained most of the year. We expect automotive as well as other end users to be stronger than typical in the fourth quarter. Ghansham Panjabi : Awesome. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Thank you. Could you talk a little more about the fiberglass shortage ever since PPG sold its business to Nippon? We really don't hear much about fiberglass for plastic reinforcement? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, we have seen a real shortage here in fiberglass. I'm not sure I can really articulate all the reasons between how it started, but what we do know is really all of the players right now in fiberglass are short. And while we do see players stabilizing, we still expect it to be well into the fourth quarter or even into next year before we see a complete stabilization of the fiberglass market. John Roberts : Okay. And then I don't know if you can answer this second one, but when CRM Tech [ph] and Celanese were both part of Hertz [ph], do you have any old timers that know whether the two businesses work closely together? I know selling these plastics today is a lot different than it was back then? Lori Ryerkerk : I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but Scott may have more hit through that. Scott Richardson : Yeah John, it was really operated very separately, as you will know, Hertz was a very large company and had a lot of different components to it and it was operated very separately. John Roberts : Okay. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : John, I'd just say something more on that. As you know we don't comment on any kind of specific opportunities or rumors or speculation, but I would just remind the group kind of not specific to CeramTec. We are always looking at a very broad range of opportunities. And over any given quarter, we explore and evaluate many, many opportunities, most of which never come to completion. So our focus remains on opportunities that go well within our business models and really meet our disciplined or return criteria and our requirements around synergies. So I'm not saying we would never do something like CeramTec. The material doesn't need to be of thermoplastic, but it does need to fit the model and it does need to meet our M&A criteria. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Bob Koort : Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could talk on the -- in the EM business, the COVID impacts were sort of affecting the auto cycle and production rates and healthcare markets. Can you give us a little update on what happened through the quarter and how you see the path for those particular end markets into the second half? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure, so for EM, I would characterize the end-market as all of the markets has recovered to pre-COVID levels at this point in time with the exception of medical implants and as you said auto, which is really more due to shortages of chips, microchips and also some shortages of resins in Q2. In fact, we're seeing growth above 2019 levels in industrial and channel and electronics and some of the other sectors. So if we look at implants, which is kind of your question, implants have improved across second quarter, we expect them to continue to recover through the end of the year and really be back at normalized rates in 2022. I will say other areas of medical though, we have seen really good growth in this year, including like long dose drug delivery, diabetes applications etcetera. So medical overall, I would say has recovered. It's just specifically the implant business, which is our GUR business, which will be into 2022 before we see full normalization. Auto, which is the other big end-market as we called out in our comment was down 8% in the quarter, but that's versus North America dropping bill to 12% and in Germany dropping bill to 15%, which was our two largest end markets and so we think we've been helped there. Autos have prioritized premium vehicles, which we talked about that in the past and we have the majority of our content in premium vehicles, but we're also seeing a real help from our programs that we put in place specifically around electric vehicles. So if you think about it in the EU, 17% of all electric vehicle sales are now sorry, of all vehicle sales are now electric vehicles and so that project pipeline where we've grown, those volumes have really helped us. We've also as we called up and expanding our content in electric vehicles. So we talked about the 20 kilograms content that we have in Europe for one of our EVs, which is four times our average ICE. Just to give you another idea, just GUR alone is 6 kilograms to 8 kilograms per electric vehicle. So really big space that we have, we have really good polymers to go into those spaces. So as we go to the second half, we do expect growth again in Q3 as we see chip recovery and we've had resin recovery. We probably won't be back to Q1 levels in Q3, but anticipate we'll be back to Q1 levels for auto by Q4. And we continue to see that few percent growth across other end users as we move through the end of the year. Bob Koort : And on a follow-up Lori is, I think in the past, you talked about some parts of the EM had become a little bit more commoditized. Was there any over earning, over margin products during the second quarter, or is there still a margin upside in some of those more mainstream products there? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : No, I think there's still more upside on margin of our products. We had a few -- if you look at our margin percent this quarter, we had a few impacts there that brought our margin down slightly from last quarter. Some of it was increased then in the plants as we needed to add more people to deal with the increased demand. We also hire energy cost, especially in Europe and then logistics and transportation, as I'm sure you're hearing from other was certainly a big headwind this past quarter and will continue to be a headwind probably through the end of the year and even into early next year. So I think as we see labor market stabilize, as we see logistics and transportation stabilize. I think we would expect to get back to previous levels of margin going forward. I would also just say, Bob, that the real difference here from what we've seen in the past is our constraints in Q2 and continuing in Q3 is not demand driven. It's really supply constraint. It's our ability to make resin, get the additive, especially glass fiber as we called out, which has continued to deteriorate as we move through second quarter and into third quarter. It's really supply constraint. So there is also more volume upside as we go forward and are able to resolve those supply constraints. Scott Richardson : Yeah Bob, I just want to clarify [indiscernible] what you eluded to are standard applications. They have more competition in them, but these are still engineered solutions and we obviously work on the more value news premium side for our new project pipeline but that standard part of the portfolio is always going to be a real critical element and really building blocks to get in the door a lot of places. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Given that there's been so much supply volatility and volatility in demand, have your cost-cutting programs executed along the lines that you've expected or have many of the cost savings been deferred to next year? I understand prices are up a lot and you're making a lot of money, but in terms of the way that you\u2019ve been trying to make your operations more efficient, are things delayed? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, no, fair question. So we had outlined, before we expected to get -- we're targeting $100 million to $150 million growth productivity. We are on track to deliver $150 million of growth productivity this year. So those are cost saving. I'd say [indiscernible] performed that. Certainly we did last year. This year I think we're going to hit that $150 million. We're also seeing is a lot of opportunity and optimization. So planned optimization, small to bottleneck projects. So we're focusing more on how do we get more sure [ph] because we are supply constraint, but we will deliver at that kind of historical level of cost productivity as well. Scott Richardson : Yeah Jeff, we typically break productivity into four buckets. [indiscernible] I'd say manufacturing cost reduction, procurement cost reduction and then I'd take more kind of S&A type reduction. S&A bucket is very small this year, the procurement bucket is very small this year, where we shifted it in 2021 is more on manufacturing cost and [indiscernible] that Lori talked about. Jeff Zekauskas : And then for my follow-up when you talked about your acquisition criteria or your acquisition and you talked about your acquisition criteria being return base, does that mean that the direction of your acquisitions really make a win the direction of diversification over time? That is should we view Celanese as really not being found by wanting to have more polymers, but really trying to find other businesses if they are available where the industry structures are good and you think that the returns are high? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look I don\u2019t think we're going to go out and acquire something completely out of our lane. One of our criteria is we want to be able to deliver synergies and to do that it means we have to either be familiar with the end market, be able to use our model or on a base, doesn\u2019t have the thermal classis. So other areas we could think of but I would still want them to have in markets that we're familiar with and where we think our current sales force and commercial teams and manufacturing teams could add value to or we could apply them to our engineered materials model or our actual model. So they maybe new materials to us, but they will have some connection to our existing business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning. Scott, just wanted to ask you on the free cash flow. I appreciate the comments about the working capital build in the quarter, but as we look out of this year and into next year and you gave some preliminary EPS view on '22. How should we be thinking about working capital and free cash flow generation as conditions normalize and I guess I just mean it in terms of where is it going to be, number one. And then number two, given everything that's gone on with raw material and availability and so forth, is there any consideration being given to hold more raw materials so that you can be better positioned or opportunistic when we continue to see supply disruptions? Scott Richardson : Yeah let me take the last part of that first and then -- I think I'd say we don't take a one at all [ph]. I think it really depends upon the business and the material and where we're at and how we see things going forward and particularly how our business is performing and certainly reliability of supply in certain materials is very important for us right now and so we may choose to hold a little bit more raw material if possible if we can get it in certain areas have tightened it. We are not going to be bound by that working capital number because our working capital efficiency has historically been very strong and we can bring that down fairly quickly if necessary in the future. In terms of how we see that working its way greater than $1.2 billion for the year assumes we get some of that working capital back towards the end of the year, but certainly not all of it and certainly not back to how we started the year and so a lot will depend upon what happens with raw materials and as well as our pricing. One of the important characteristic here is accounts receivable and with what we've seen in pricing in Asia in asset yields which tends to have slightly longer payment terms, we're carrying a little more accounts receivable today and what we have historically. So as that normalizes, we'll get some of that back and so there will be a catch up likely into next year. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow-up there were also comments in their belief about sort of the Chinese price will be coming down, but there will still be strengthen in Europe and India because I think there was a reference, so there is typically a lag. Just wanted to better understand sort of what causes that dynamic where it doesn't get our doubt pretty quickly that you could have serious price discrepancies between those three areas? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look if you think about it, there is not much acetic acid production in India and basically that material comes out of China or Singapore somewhere else in the world. So you have a shipping delay that prices go low. I think for Europe most of the material going into Europe comes either from the US or from Asia and so you have that shipping delay as well. It's really just as simple as that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. John McNulty : Thanks for taking my question. Lori, in the prepared remarks you had indicated the 2023 goals were likely going to come in around or in 2022. Can you just clarify whether that is inclusive or exclusive of standard premium if it's really just a reflection of kind of the current markets and your comfort in the demand fundamentals or if it does include the M&A? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look we'll give better guidance in October as we've more time to work through this. I would say the $13 to $14 earnings per share that we had for '23 went up a point into '22. I would look at this it's that way into with or without santoprene, I mean santoprene is definitely a value accretive to us but we model in all of our cash being used for stock purchases. So while there is some uplift, I would say I'd look at santoprene to taking this closer to the high end of that range whereas without santoprene we would be at the lower end of that range. John McNulty : And then just as a follow-up, the guide that you have -- actually a pretty tight range for the rest of the year and I guess just given the volatility that you're seeing in all the markets like I guess I'm curious how comfortable with such a tight range on such a big base? Is it -- have you locked in, in terms of some of the commodity prices, have some customers reached out to try to maybe lock in things for the year or I guess how do you get as much comfort as you have in such a volatile market? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look if you look at Q3 guidance, I'd say from knowing what our books are, we're half way through the quarter already from our standpoint. So we can get pretty comfortable with Q3. I think for the full year, it's a little bit different that again could really supply constrain if not a demand constraint. So even with the volatility in the market we still can only sell the amount of material we have and we know how much material we have. So yes, it could be big swings in asset yields and that could change a bit. We just gave -- it was a narrow range admittedly, but we just kind of said, here is what our projection is given that we are fairly close to the end of the year. Scott Richardson : Yeah and John I think we tried to outline in the prepared remarks some of the assumptions we make to get to that range. So as those change a little bit, then we'll update that in October. John McNulty : Got it. Fair enough. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question, Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori. Lori, a question around regional demand trends, obviously it seems the base of vaccination is very different by region, particularly in Asia, still some lockdowns continuing over there. And then on top of that, you sort of overlay some of these supply chain constraints that you guys were talking about, others have talked about as well. So A, what are you guys seeing in terms or demand growth disparities between regions and then on a go-forward basis, what does this tell you about demand growth? Are we going to be in a period of above normal demand growth as more and more parts of the world sort of start normalizing and lockdowns start waning? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I would say at this point in time, certainly as we've started coming out of COVID, we thought saw its move around the globe, where Asia was strong earlier and then the Americas and Europe was slow as to recover. I would say at this point, demand is pretty normalized around the globe in terms of being pretty consistent across region. Interestingly enough, while we were worried about the Delta variant, we haven't seen it have much impact yet. Although that is a concern, as I said, we see some signs that there may be some impacts in Southeast Asia, but I would say in general the globe is pretty consistent right now in terms of recovery. Hassan Ahmed : Understood. And now moving on to the tow business, obviously very strong volume growth sequentially in Q2 and I guess in sort of the written remarks you guys talked about some of the Q1 demand sort of carrying forward into Q2. How are you guys thinking about demand growth, volume growth in that business in the back half of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, really the volume growth in Q2 was in fact what you just called out, which is, we work with customers in Q1 because of the freeze and our shortage of acetic acid. So we worked with customers in Q1 and to push demand into Q2. And so, if you look back at Q1, we had reduced volumes in Q1, those volumes showed up in Q2. I think, we actually see volumes being stable through the rest of the year kind of at the average. I'd expect the second half volumes to look kind of like the first half volumes. Earnings will be less because, acetic acid pricing remains high relative to historical. We have higher energy costs, especially in Europe and just the timing of our dividends from our Chinese JV which typically are heavily weighted to the first half. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Lori just on the M&A pipeline, excluding CRM Tech [ph]. How is that pipeline today? Lori Ryerkerk : So I'd say our M&A pipeline remains very robust. We continue to look at deals of all size. You saw that with, santoprene, which is a big bolt on [indiscernible], which was a small bolt on, and then even some divestitures we did. So I think, we remain very active looking at our portfolio, where we want to add, where we need to take away. I would say we're very actively looking at deals of all size. We certainly have the financial capacity, as well as the management capacity to continue to look at additional M&A, through the rest of this year and into next year. David Begleiter : Well, just in the prepared comments, you laid out a number of projects, many of which come online over the next couple of years. How has that mix trench of projects in your mind at 24 through 25, 26 projects late looking in, is it different than the current one that we're in right now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so really the only thing we have kind of on the books at this point in time for that period is the GUR expansion in EU, which we expect to come online in 2024. I would say, given that we're just in 2021, we're just now starting to look at what will our demand be in that period of time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Richard actually on for Mike. So my first question is on engineering materials. It looks like you were able to get a 7% increase in price. In the second quarter you also talked about sourcing challenges and raw material costs and inflation. How much of the price increase was to offset the costs, higher costs and were, how much was that just part of adding value to your customers? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I would say look, our team has worked really aggressively through -- through starting in fourth quarter of last year, actually to really push price, knowing that we saw this increase in raw material pricing coming. So I would say that was a primary reason for the price increase. But we did raise price more than with our raw materials increasing. And I think that's a question of mix. I mean, what we are in a very tight supply constraint situation. So we have been prioritizing our higher margin products and our higher margin regions to really maximize the return that we get for the molecules that we have available to sell to the market. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And as a follow-up on the asset sale chain, you gave some color in terms of pricing coming down in the second half. What's your view on, on spreads? Obviously you're low cost, but I guess your Asian competitors could get squeezed as if, if prices continue to fall. How do you think about that heading into the end of this year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I mean, certainly if you look at China, for example, our technology is certainly advantage versus the debacle to technology or some of the others, as prices fall, they will get squeezed in terms of margin. Clearly our capacity on the Gulf coast, which uses natural gas is the most cost effective in the world. And so, we will still maintain that advantage on margins versus competitors, as prices continue to moderate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning. Can you talk about your Elastomers acquisition from Exxon? What are the industries you're targeting and why do you think in your mind, Exxon is getting out? And is there any supply coming online with the supply demand there? Is there any new supply coming online in China or elsewhere? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look, we're really excited about this acquisition. I mean, you'll have to ask the Exxon why they're getting out. I will give you, my opinion, which is what they've only had this business since 1980s, that was a JV. They acquired it fully in, I think about 2000, maybe 2010, sometime in that first decade. Look, this is not one of their core businesses. Exxon is an oil and gas commodity chemical player. This is a highly specialized business and I'm sure why they enjoy the margins and returns from it. It's not, it doesn't really fit their model of what they're trying to do. And, and having come out of an Exxon specialty business, it's, they struggle to run them in a way that can be highly competitive with others. So my guess is they realized that was more valuable to us than it was to them. If you look at in-market, it is largely into auto think, think -- things that need to be, recyclable or long life or soft touch or light weighting. But there are also applications for it into medical applications, into construction, things seals around windows and skyscrapers. And so as we look at it, we think it's a really good fit for us to cross sell. With our automotive side, we think there are some really exciting new applications in medical going forward that given our knowledge now as a medical and pharma industry, we can exploit. And so we think there's a lot of opportunities there to really apply these materials to businesses we already know already understand and already know how to access the market. Again, our willingness to do -- deal with complexity is, is just different than Exxon. We, we here deal with small orders every day. That's not something Exxon wants to do. They, so I think we see a lot of value uplift opportunity here and what we consider very profitable in markets as we go forward. In terms of the new capacity, we are not aware of any new capacity coming on in this area. It is, is a highly specialized material. And we don't, we don't see any now we don't anticipate any for the future. This in fact Exxon had grown the capacity, this business in just the last couple of years I think in the Newport facility. Scott Richardson : Yeah PJ, just on that last point, I think it's important to remember, this really is an engineered solution and supply-demand utilization lot less important here in these businesses much like other engineered materials businesses because of the value and used element and the uniqueness and differentiation of what this material and this brand brings to customers and it's really one of the real attractive element. So that should be really complementary to our engineer materials business. P.J. Juvekar: And Lori overall a question on the tightness and logistics and labor markets that you talked about, you think they will last into 2022? Is that a US phenomenon or is that happening in Europe as well and why do you think this is taking long time to get ironed out? Is it the logistics part of the issue or is it the labor market? Can you just talk a little bit more about that? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think they're really two separate things. I would say the logistics and transportation issues are at the level certainly global, we see peak a lot upon people trying to get out of China as you know but I'd say really whatever you're going is pretty hard right now, whether it's by ship or on the ground or rail, there is just a lot of volume being moved around the world. Not sure I could explain all the reasons why, but certainly people are moving more things I mean just the amount of things you buy at Amazon these days. We just see a real constraint there and that's really what I was referring to. I think it's well into next year I think possibly even after Chinese New Year before we really start to see stabilization in those market. The labor phenomenon I discussed is really been more of an issue in the US than in other parts of the world. We haven't had as many issues in Asia for example, nor we have the issues in China but in the US I think we just -- we see people we're hiring to expand and run our plans are also being hired by Amazon to run their warehouses for example and so it's just a very competitive labor market and we have to make adjustments as we wanted to add shifts and do things that would want us expand rather quickly to our labor rates. But I think in time, this will stabilize as we see more people going back to work in the US. I think this will also stabilize and I do think probably this will take into next year as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Yes. Good morning. Lori, I thought your guidance in engineered materials was quite constructive, but I wanted to peel the onion a little bit more with regard to the glass fiber shortage. Can you talk about the upside opportunities and the downside risks related to that supply shortage for example, on the volume side, how much might you be constraining or what is your guidance there? And then on the price side, I guess my question would be, is there opportunity to capitalize by raising price in the engineered products that might require glass fiber? I assume that's certain polyesters and maybe sell strands of some nylon grades. Maybe you could just elaborate on what's going on there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, let me speak a little bit more clear on the characterization, if we look at second quarter, we would estimate, we probably walk as much as $5 million revenue due to problems around glass fiber as well as a little bit the logistic transportation issues. If we look at third quarter, that is probably going to double, but we do expect it to resolve and we get some of those volumes back starting in the fourth quarter and going into 2022. We are seeing glass fiber makers coming back but we are seeing the volumes go up. Glass fiber that goes into polymer is a very small percentage of the glass fiber market, but it's slightly more profitable segment. So we do expect to see start seeing more glass fiber coming back towards as we move into fourth quarter. Look, I think long term as this goes on, it has been an opportunity for us to convert to other polymers or polymers and also glass fibers that we prioritize as higher margin polymers so that people can get their product. So I think there is some upside hear and we've been able to convert some of its higher-margin product, but I think long-term, it is about a third of our portfolio that uses glass fiber. So it is a pretty important raw material for us going forward. And we've taken steps commercially to secure supply of glass fiber in future years. So hopefully we don't run into this problem. Kevin McCarthy : That's really helpful. And then secondly, if I may do you have plant maintenance turnarounds in the third quarter or the fourth quarter that we should be keeping in mind for modeling purposes? Lori Ryerkerk : No, we always have small turnarounds and maintenance items, but the total for this year is only $30 million, for the entirety of the year is split pretty evenly between the first half and the second half. So it's not anything of note of that you're going to notice in terms of our volumes are our costs. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, 8% sequential impact on automotive volumes. Did that number include the shortages of nylon, glass fiber PBT, etcetera, or were those raw material shortages some additional impact on top of that? And if so, how large was that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, no, that was inclusive of everything, Aleksey. That was both, demand from auto as well as constraints we had due to resin and additive supplies. Aleksey Yefremov : So if we were trying to normalize for if few volumes for current state of demand, it's that 8% and maybe automotive is a third of your business. So something like 2.5% should be added to topline when everything is running well, is that the right way to think about things? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, roughly that's about right. If you think about it for this kind of demand, you just need to see a few percent increase in everything else in order to stay stable. So that's about right. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you, Laurie. And quick question on EM margins. Should we look at second quarter margins as sort of the benchmark for the rest of the year or will these margins be rising? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think, based on what I had just said earlier about that, the impact that we saw from supply shortages, logistics and things, I would expect Q3 to look pretty much like Q2, probably from a margin standpoint, because we do see, especially the glass fiber issue continuing well through Q3. I would expect Q4 margins to look more like Q1 again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew DeYoe : Thank you. In the past, you've been calling for a more normal EBIT and asset yield chain next year, which may be implied something like the $700 million to $800 million number. But I think if I heard correctly in an answer to I think Duffy's question, earlier you seem to support something closer to $900 to $1 billion. Do I have that wrong or is it more optimistic view, just a function of the better backdrop that you've been kind of been talking about? Lori Ryerkerk : I think, as we've worked through this year and we've seen the impact of various bottlenecks and productivity products and continuing to optimize our model for asset yields the addition of the US tax and other things, we really feel like we've lifted the foundational level of earnings from kind of that $700 million to $800 million to now $800 million to $900 million and we're expecting some goodness to continue in asset yield margins into 2022, that put us at that kind of $900 million range for asset yields. Matthew DeYoe : Understood and similarly, I guess if I'm remembering correctly, I think the comment used to be that breaking up the company would result in something like $50 million of these synergies, but that you're constantly been trying to work that number down, is it still around that number? Do I have that number wrong or is it higher now or lower or is there any difference? Lori Ryerkerk : I think $50 million is still a good number to use. I don't, I honestly don't see it really going a lot lower. I think we used to think it was even higher. I think $50 million is probably the right range to use for the level of the synergies we would expect if we -- for the company. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. Frank Mitsch : Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Lori, in release, it mentioned that you were able to bring back the Clear Lake facility during the quarter. I was wondering how much you may have lost by not having it through the entire quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I don't have an exact number. I think if you look at the residual impacts of winter storm, in quarter two we think it was probably about a $30 million impact and that's from higher rods [ph] energy inventories. Primarily all of that wasn\u2019t easy. Frank Mitsch : Got you. And can you comment just in general on the overall industry operating rates in the asset yields chain that you're seeing right now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so if we look at Q2, I would say we think globally, utilization was up just over 90%, China just under 90%, but we also know that they were much higher intermittently and probably close to a 100% at many times during the quarter. BAM [ph] globally also add 100% basically for the quarter. With this capacity coming on in China in August as anticipated, we actually think utilization will remain at similar levels again, because there is pent up demand in the chain, there is a need to rebuild inventory. But I would say right now we still think we're somewhere around that 90% range globally and probably should continue to be so during third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Blair : Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Congrats on the results. The pre-release comments listed out nine discreet organic growth projects. What is the big picture EBITDA number for polys projects in total? Scott Richardson : Yeah, Matthew, I don't think we've called that out specifically for each project. We inherently included that in our Investor Day guide for 2023 and then we indicated there was additional uplift into '24 and '25. We will, as we update that outlook going forward, we'll provide a little more clarity on kind of how that materializes in those out years but, but we haven't specifically given a number for all the projects. Matthew Blair : Got it. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. Just two quick ones. Given the supply chain lags and the stronger demand and low inventory levels, how resilient do you think the acetic value chain will be if there was a direct hit in the Gulf Coast from a hurricane to season compared to like the normal hurricane impacts? And secondly, can you give a sense for how the competitive intensity and process R&D and asset yields is evolving? Are the Chinese sort of doing the work, are you seeing the competitive gap closing or do you see it widening now that BP shifted the business over to NES [ph]? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. On your first one on hurricanes, who can say right, where it hit, what it takes down in addition to acetic acid plants, does it take down consumers, it's hard to say. I would say in a tight market, any disruption gets amplified with even higher prices and more panic buying and other things. So in a very tight market, a hurricane right now, even the threat of one probably would cause some upward movement in the market, but it's really hard to predict what the overall impact would be. I think there a competitive gap. I think look, we continue to invest in R&D. I know our competitors do as well. I would say we think we continue to have advantage technologies in acidic acid, in BAM, in emulsion. We don't really see that gap closing. We think everybody continues to move up, but we don't really see that gap closing at this point in time. Scott Richardson : Daryl, make the next question, last one please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question here. Just wanted to follow up a little bit more on that long term outlook on the AC chain then. So do you think we've kind of entered a structurally higher area of earnings power? I know that you guys have changed your plans as far as your footprint optimization, but is there a scenario where you'd see continued global capacity additions and would you participate in that? It does appear that there are pockets of production shortages globally as you mentioned India and elsewhere. So I guess maybe if you could provide a little bit longer term view on your capacity and maybe the industry's capacity as well. Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So, it's kind of a broad question, but let me try to break it down. So as just one of the things we did that we think improved our foundational earnings in terms of productivity and capacity debottlenecks etcetera and strengthening of our chain and strengthening of our model. I think it's also fair to say that we believe that the acetic industry dynamics has improved over the long-term. So if you think about it just growing at kind of GDP between '18 and '21, we saw nearly a million tons in demand growth for the industry and during that time, we didn't add any new capacity. So it is a more tightly constrained market than it was say back in '18, the last time we had a price run up. We have a little bit of capacity coming on stream here in China that we talked about and of course we have a lot of capacity, our own capacity coming on 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023. So those are the big capacity ads that are out there. But even if you add those together, it's kind of three or four years of growth in a very tight market. And again, we don't intend to run our capacity unless it makes sense to do so. So I think the market dynamics have definitely improved over the last few years and continue to improve with just normal GDP growth that could motivate people to get into the market. But I would say it's a very expensive market to get into. You know our 1.3 million tons of capacity that we're adding at Clear Lake, we're spending $315 million to do so, but if we look at Greenfield build, like they're doing in China, our own estimate of building that plant in China, because they don't have the infrastructure and everything else is well in excess of $2 billion, that's a big hump for people to get over. You have to have availability of syngas, you have to have access to hydrogen. You have to have a good energy source. It's a big hurdle for people to get over. It's a little better in the Gulf Coast of the U.S., but again we already have a lot of players in the Gulf Coast. So we don't see any new capacity coming on immediately. Even if someone were to start today, they're still four or five years out from adding new. So we see for the foreseeable future, this remaining a pretty robust tight market. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Brandon Ayache for any closing remarks. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. We want to thank everybody for listening in today. As always we're available after the call for any further questions you might have. Daryl, let's go ahead and please close out the call.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll go ahead and open the lines for your questions. Kevin, please go ahead and open the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Vincent Andrews : Thank you and good morning everyone. Just in engineered materials you only had a modest volume hit sequentially despite obviously the auto situation, got more challenging in the quarter and you found other high value places to put that volume. So I guess as we think about 2022 and 2023 when that auto volume comes back presumably you are not going to -- I guess my question is, is that incremental on top of where you've already put this other volume or do you anticipate shifting some of that -- having to shift some of that volume back to your auto customers? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, thanks for the question Vincent. If we look at Q3, auto builds were down pretty significantly globally, like 12% down, from the prior quarter and certainly that had some impact on us. What I would say is though it had less impact on us as just given the nature of where we are, I mean if we really look at our Q3 volumes they were down into auto only about 1%. And there is a couple reasons for that, one is if you look at, we have shifted our portfolio more to electric vehicles, electric vehicles are actually up about 35% year-on-year in terms of builds and we expect that to continue into next year. And because we have so much more exposure now to electric vehicles so think about lithium-ion battery separator film which has grown 40% year-on-year, even though only about 10% to 15% of our portfolio now goes to electric vehicles, that still did went a long way in kind of negating the impact we saw from the overall decline in auto builds. So what I would say is yes, while we did shift some volume out of auto we also have the shift within auto which allowed us to really get through the quarter with very little volume loss end-to-end markets and we did see some more shift into other applications like industrial and electrical which were stronger in the quarter but I would say actually a more of the shift was probably within auto into the EV which is consistent with the strategy that we laid out at the end of 2019. Scott Richardson : Yeah, and we wouldn't expect to give that volume up as auto recovers in 2022 and 2023. So we think about the auto recovery kind of being on top of that. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah and then if you think where the volume is going to come from, because we did run pretty full in Q3 but we did lose about 8KT of production in Q3 due to the unavailability of raw materials, be that resin or glass fiber or flame retardants. So as we -- as those issues resolved themselves hopefully through the end of the year and into next year, that\u2019s the additional volume that we will be able to put into both auto and our other end use applications. Vincent Andrews : Great and then if I could just ask on the $100 million with $50 million in EM and $50 million in AC, how does that trend - in your 2022 and 2023 assumptions, does that -- are you assuming that would sort of normalize when you get it back or you are just sort of assuming it stays the same? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think just as we assume product prices and EBIT margins are going to normalize as we move through 2022, so probably towards in the second half of 2022 and we're assuming normalized prices in 2023, we also assume that those inflationary pressures in energy and in raw materials will also normalize in that time. So think about it as the margins normalizing through the second half of 2022 and be normalized for 2023. Vincent Andrews : Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now live. John Roberts : Thank you. Do you or your syn gas supplier in Nanjing need to make structural changes to avoid the energy curtailments in the future? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look I mean I think it's an interesting question. I mean it's hard to know what structural changes you would make simply because the entire economy of China is based on coal gasification. So we don't really know what to expect in terms of energy curtailments in the future. What I would say is we have seen this happen in China from time to time as a result of their Blue Sky initiatives whether it's for the Olympics or some other thing. And so we're not going to speculate on what's driving this energy curtailment but while we expect the curtailments to be moderate in the fourth quarter we don't really know what to expect yet for next year. So I think it's a little early to address this. What I would say is we are a little different than some of our competition in China just in terms of what else our syn gas provider does. So, they have some choices that they can make about where this syn gas go, whether it comes to us or whether it goes into olefins and frankly right now economically it makes more sense for it to come to us. John Roberts : And then back on the engineered plastics question, it takes a while to get spec into new applications so I assume that rapid pivot to make up the lost auto volume that was existing applications that you have had that just surged? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look we're seeing strong demand across all sectors of engineered materials so I would say any volume we can make -- we can sell to an existing customer for an existing application. That said in the Q3 we had 815 project wins. We continue to grow quarter-on-quarter in terms of the number project wins we have and the value of those project wins in Q3 was up 11% versus the prior year. So we are getting new projects all the time, they tend to be higher margin projects that we\u2019re able to close, and they are higher volume projects. So, if you look at that going forward it just says our ability to shift between areas as we are essentially in a solid position we will continue to be where we can continue to ship volumes to high margin products. Scott Richardson : Yes John, if you recall a couple years ago when Lori came in one of the first things we did was we do a robust strategy refresh. And what came out of that was the high growth program focus that Tom Kelly in the Engineered Materials team talked about at our Investor Day. And so a lot of that effort around 5G, electric vehicles, medical, etcetera was started two years ago and we're really starting to see the pipeline pay off from that here now a couple of years into that work. And so I would say there is always some short term stuff but a lot of this is things we've now been working for a couple of years. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Are average acetic acid prices in China and Europe and average VAM prices in China and Europe likely to be higher in the fourth quarter than they were in the third or comparable? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, it\u2019s a great question Jeff, we hope we can answer that. As we look towards the fourth quarter for pricing I think we did see Q3 moderate from Q2, I mean down about 15% in China. Similarly, though we saw western hemisphere prices for acetic acid go up 15%. So I think right now after the brief surge we had in prices following the energy curtailment, acetic acid has settled in now to kind of that $1000 per ton price. So that's a little above Q3 but I do expect it's going to continue to moderate over the quarter. So I guess on average our best view at this point is probably Q4 will look similar to Q3 in terms of averages for acetic acid.  I think VAM is a little trickier. We have seen a surge in VAM pricing following the energy curtailment as not just our VAM capacity which was shut down for a few weeks but other VAM capacity was shut down because these are more highly energy intensive processes in the acetyl chain. So we have seen more loss of VAM capacity in China with the higher raw materials, we've seen some of that capacity slow to come back or additional capacity stay down. So VAM prices remain quite high, I mean record levels, well over $2000 a ton. And I think we're not seeing any falloff in demand for VAM and for downstream VAM derivatives just because they're such low inventory that you may be hearing from others on their call in the chain. So I would expect VAM pricing to -- it's quite high in Q3 but I would expect that to stay at that level or possibly even a little stronger as we go into Q4 which would offset any further softening we see in acetic acid. Jeffrey Zekauskas : So, there's been all kinds of outages in 2021 from weather and then we had outages in China or curtailments in China, have all of these different events led you to have a different view of where acetic acid and VAM pricing might be at the end of next year, that is have they structurally changed the way that you expect the industry to evolve? And then secondly with all of the outages that you've had this year how much more acetyl volume can you produce next year than you produced this year at a normal operating rate? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so have the outages affected my view of the industry, I think the answer is no. What continues to change is the supply demand balance gets tighter and tighter and we've been calling that out for a few years. I mean every year demand goes up 600 KT and so that\u2019s like one plant every year and nobody has been building plants. So we're steadily now in that structural utilization kind of mid-80s to 90s which means instantaneous utilization when you account for turnarounds and unplanned downtimes and everything is in that high 90s, mid-90s to 100%. And that's going to continue. So it is that structural change in the industry which affects where I think we will settle. I don't think we're going to settle acetic acid prices down in the 300 range where we used to see it settled. I think it is going to be higher than that because structurally it's just a much tighter industry. And I think what you see is the outages really reinforced that point because we very rapidly see the run up in pricing any time there's the slightest wobble.  So I think it's not the outages that has changed my view, I think the outages have reinforced our view that structurally this is the tight need market that is going to enjoy good margins for some period of time. And we've talked about in other quarters as there is not -- we had a little bit of capacity come on in China this year with [indiscernible]. We have our capacity coming on in 2023 which of course we will run to meet the market demand, it has a lot of flexibility to take it up and down depending on what's going on with the markets. But there's nothing else currently being built and yet demand is going to continue to grow. So it is going to settle higher but I think it's really the overall underlying structure versus say the outages.  So, what does that mean in terms of availability, I mean yes we were down this year for the freeze event and of course we had some supplier issues for some time following the freeze event. Other than that actually our units run very reliably this year. I do think as we move into future years we will be back at a normal pattern of turnarounds. So while I think there's some incremental capacity available to us next year I wouldn't say it is probably really significant from a volume standpoint. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you so much Lori. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now live. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. Maybe a little bit to follow on the last question and also tying into several of your big customers on the coating side of actually called out emulsions as being problematic from a pricing and sourcing standpoint. So when you look at how tight you see things over the next couple of years when you look at the size of those customers, should we expect some meaningful sized new announcements over the next year either on VAM where you would maybe ship in acetic acid or would there be anybody that would look at doing kind of an integrated acetic acid in the VAM project in the U.S.? Lori Ryerkerk : It is an interesting question Duffy. I mean let me kind of take the last part. I really wouldn't expect anybody to do an acetic acid to VAM to VAE kind of new build. I just don't think economically I mean that\u2019s just the acetic acid part of that is probably at least a $2 billion investment and then you add on the VAM and VAE might even double that depending on the size of the facility. So I think that's a pretty big lift for just about anybody not to mention the space, the infrastructure, the permitting, everything. I mean this is a 5 to 7 year prospect if someone were to start now so that's a ways out there. So I'm not worried about that. Like I said we have 1.3 million tons coming on in 2023 which is basically the equivalent of two world scale plants for acetic acid. And you will recall we've announced a series of VAM and VAE expansions globally around the world trying to meet what we do see as is continuing strong demand. I mean part of the problem right now of course is with the freeze, with other outages things have gotten behind. At one point as people restock the world will normalize again as we will see acetic acid prices come down that will lead eventually to lower VAM prices and lower VAE prices. Energy is a big factor so I mean I think it's going to normalize even short of a lot of new capacity being added but we do see the need for more capacity to come online which is the need we think we are best positioned to meet given our great technology, our lower -- our energy efficient technology and our integration not just within our plants but also our networks globally that allow us to really optimize and provide secure supply to our customers around the globe. Duffy Fischer : Great, thank you. And then maybe just a second one on the $15 for next year, can you walk us through are there any meaningful changes that would be in that number cash flow that would get spent on a buy back, maybe a change in the tax rate, I am just trying to understand kind of like what's the base assumptions for that $15 for next year other than where spreads go? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, let me just kind of walk through it and cover some of the things we are assuming in that number. So what we said is next -- an adjusted EPS next year of at least $15. That is based on I believe our acetyl business will have an EBIT between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. As I said a little earlier in the call that assumes we see relatively strong pricing we are expecting in the fourth quarter continuing into the first half of the year. Where you are in that range indicates where it might be different places we think it might start to moderate whether it is a little bit before the third quarter, whether it's into the third quarter. We do though expect to see moderation to normalized pricing sometime mid-year. And as I said, similar volumes to what we did this year because we think with turnarounds, normalized levels of turnarounds and everything I just assume kind of similar volumes.  For EM we are expecting 700 million to 800 million of EBIT that does include Santoprene, it does include the organic growth both from our project model and our growth model but also the Bishop GUR expansion but I would say it's also dampened a bit by our expectation that auto builds will not recover next year. So we're expecting auto builds at the same level we're seeing auto builds in 2021 and that affects our normal materials into auto but it also will affect Santoprene because it is 65% into auto. And then it's totally expected to be pretty consistent with this year because we expected to continue to be challenged by acetic acid pricing at least in the first half of the year and also by energy pricing. I won't say if you add all those up you might come up with a number slightly over 15, so what you should be aware of is, is we do expect the weather to go up as we expect less pension income next year with maybe a softening in the market which will then raise [indiscernible].  So, if you look at that in terms of free cash flow, I mean free cash flow we're basically saying even with a lower expectation on EBIT earnings driven primarily by moderation in acetyl, we do expect about the same level of free cash flow. So lower earnings but we do would then get that working capital normalization that shows that this free cash flow are booked if we see the moderation in acetyls. And we do expect slightly higher CAPEX, we are still taking CAPEX around 600 million next year but we won't have the E.U. payments. So kind of look at all of that that washes out to basically free cash flow in the same level we expect to see this year. Duffy Fischer : Great, thank you. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Your line is now live. Hassan Ahmed : Morning Lori. Lori, as I take a look at your sort of prepared remarks and the guidance you gave for the Acetyl Chain, you're looking for sustainably sort of over $1 billion in 2022 and 2023 EBIT, you cited rightly so a bunch of different reasons why you feel that's doable. One of them was the sort of uplift in the cost cuts. So just wanted to sort of get your thoughts around what's going on over there. Obviously I see what's happening with the raw material side of things and the like and you cited sort of escalation in pricing for catalysts and the like as well. So just on a relative basis I'm trying to get a better sense of how much -- how we should think about your cost advantage relative to competitors improving in this sort of new raw materials large catalyst cost world? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think I will just back up a little bit Hassan. If you look at like a decade ago our foundational earnings for acetyls were in that 300 million to 400 million. And then if you go as recently as even last year we were saying we think our foundational earnings are around 800 million and that was based on continued rationalization of our footprint, expansion activities we had done, work we had done to improve the productivity of our sites whether it be energy efficiency or catalyst recovery systems and things that lowered our cost of production. And now we're saying we think that base level is greater than $1 billion and so it's really the same thing. I mean it is productivity, it is energy efficiency, but it also is this market dynamic that I was talking about and if you go back a decade we had really over built in China. But the industry had over built in China and we were at low utilization, I mean mid-60s to growing to mid-70s. Now we are at much higher level of utilization with no new capacity other than our own on the horizon and maybe a few other little things around the globe. And so we are just in a much tighter area of supply demand which we expect will continue for the next five to seven years unless someone else build new capacity. But it will take them that long and that's really why we're saying that foundational earning will be kind of low as we think, we will achieve in any given time is now at about that 1 billion level.  Now obviously that could change where global economic recession or something. I mean, but I'm just saying in normal economic conditions we think that before. And I think it really demonstrates also the power of the model that we have developed over these last 10 years where we are able to as we did in the third quarter we had a 15% decline in the price of acetic acid in China but we were able to recover that with the price in the western hemisphere because we still had tightness in the western hemisphere. And we are at 8% less earnings from acid globally in the third quarter than we did in second quarter but we were able to recover that in margins for VAM and VAE and other downstream derivatives because -- and having that flexibility to shift geographically and having that ability to flex in the chain is what gives us confidence that unlike many of our competitors who don't have that flexibility we will be able to deliver that $1 billion of foundational means going forward. Hassan Ahmed : That's very helpful Lori, very helpful. And as a follow-up again reverting back to your prepared remarks, your commentary about relatively tepid, long-term sort of supply growth I found super interesting, particularly as you sort of talked about China, would love for you to dig a bit deeper into that, I mean you're talking about how the whole sort of capital cost advantage in China has dwindled. The whole permitting process is far more complex. I mean to me that sounds super bullish not just for the Acetyl Chain but for commodity chemicals in general? Lori Ryerkerk : No, I think that's right. I mean look we're not that many years ago we would have said there was a large advantage to building in China just from speed of build and a cost to build. As China has developed, as they have developed a stronger working class I would say that advantage doesn't exist anymore, not in the same way. Now, look we are still bullish on China, we are still bullish about our operations there. But that advantage of being in China just from -- just as a place to be because of lower cost but it doesn't really exist anymore. Now there are other reasons to be in China like we are which is making things in China for the China market which continues to be a great market. But making things in China for export not so attractive anymore. And I think that's true for other commodities as well and for other regions of the world as well. And I think also with the supply chain issue that we've all experienced this year, I think our strategy of making locally for local demand has proven to be a good one and probably one we will see other start to follow as well. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful Lori. Thank you so much. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter again. In terms of your comments here on the cost curve for the Acetyl Chain, where are we now in terms of the advantages. Is the rest of the world three to four times more expensive or higher, just curious how that has changed relative to the footprint you have in the States? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look still although we see increases in natural gas in the United States that acetyl produced in the United States especially for us at Clear Lake with our technology, with the economy of scale it's still very much on the lower end of the cost curve and I would say quite significantly. China coal had gotten more expensive even than Singapore for a while because Singapore was oil based but coal has gone up, oil has gone up. So I would say what we're seeing is while the entirety of the cost curve has gone up, it hasn't really changed the dynamic about the very large advantage that we have in the Gulf Coast of the U.S. versus the rest of the world. Michael Sison : Got it and then for your outlook for 2022 in EM, I think you commented organic growth of mid to high single digits in 2022 and maybe in 2023. That assumes auto doesn't grow in 2022 and then in 2023 do you think auto grows and that growth rate is higher? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, I think on a simplistic level, yes. I mean I think -- look we have growth in 2022 just not in auto. We have growth in medical, we have growth in electrical, I mean we also do expect to have some lingering impacts of the shortages of resin, glass, and flame retardants as we go into 2022 so I would expect a higher level of growth in 2023 based on the regrowth in auto and hopefully the full resolution of all the supply chain issues. Michael Sison : Right, thank you. Operator : Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning everybody. I guess Lori, relative to your outlook today, AC segment from three months ago, is it purely the curtailments in China and the impact of pricing that is driving the upgraded view on 4Q EBIT or is there anything else as it relates to demand or mix or even higher feedstock costs? And then related to that, just your thoughts on how you see curtailments playing out of for 4Q specifically and the risk on the first quarter as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look we have baked in already for fourth quarter so let me start there. I mean look we're seeing very modest curtailments in 4Q. I mean the differences in 3Q it had all happened in about 15 days and in the fourth quarter the provinces know the number, they've been able to optimize more. And so, we're seeing only really modest curtailments in fourth quarter and it's a period typically worry [ph] of seasonality and we weren't expecting much this year. But I would say that\u2019s fully baked into our fourth quarter. But clearly those curtailments and any impact they're having on others as well the curtailments we had in third quarter has changed our view of how long this pricing situation is going to last. People are not going to be able to rebuild inventories now in the fourth quarter and so I think it just pushes that higher range of pricing further into 2022. As we do fully expect, people once prices start to moderate even if they're still fairly high prices they will want to rebuild inventory especially because we're already be going into the next construction season at the end of 1Q. So I think that really accounts for the change in our outlook for 2022, it's just this continued level of higher pricing, higher margins for acetyls extending longer into the year now than what we thought a quarter ago. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it and the thesis point you, sorry, I was going to say the thesis points you laid out in your prepared comments, specific to China and the capacity additions and their unlikely nature there just based on the world unchanged for the past decade along with the economics, does that also impact on the same basis your own supply chain and your own access to materials, etc., how are you sort of thinking about that risk aspect? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, we've had some issues around materials for additives and that applies to powders and things as well, things you never even hear about or think about. But I would say in a major way we make 35% to 40% of our own CO. We start very far up in the value chain and we go very far to the end. So again, I think what we see now in raw material, I mean, why certainly has impacted us, I think we've also had more ability to deal with that because we have more choices in the chain, where we can make decisions that ultimately, help maintain or even in some cases improve our margins relative to others. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks so much. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now live. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, hi, good morning, Lori. Couple of things on your Acetyl Chains commentary that sort of piqued my interest. First, you talk about catalyst cost going up due to precious metals pricing. How big is the catalyst cost and is it just the raw material inflation issue with precious metals or is there an availability issue of catalysts? And the second question there you talk about, the capital advantage to build capacity in China versus U.S. is now negligible which is very interesting because steel costs are the same everywhere and they always had cheap labor and China was exporting deflation all these years, do you think that's behind us and is it permanent? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, let me talk about catalyst costs first. I mean, we haven't really shared the numbers but earlier in the year, let's go back to like first quarter, second quarter, we actually saw costs for some catalysts we used, precious metals, think rhodium, think platinum, these sorts of things, we actually saw increased by 10 times versus what we had had in previous year. Now, a lot of these same materials go into other applications, they go into catalytic converters and, back when auto was really picking up we really saw a lot of competition for that limited supply of precious metals. Interesting enough with and not surprisingly also with the reduction in auto builds, not so many catalytic converters being built, we've actually seen some moderation back to maybe now only five times what it is. So I would say precious metals versus -- that's bet, we have seen some moderation. And I think the volatility we're seeing in pricing there is just typical of the volatility we're seeing around the world where a lot of pent up demand, people really wanting to produce but a lot of I would say almost worsening issues around supply chain logistics and everything else which is keeping all of these markets quite volatile. But I would say volatile at a much higher level than we enjoyed, say just even two years ago. P.J. Juvekar: Okay, and then on the steel side\u2026 Lori Ryerkerk : On the steel side you are right, still kind of cost the same around the world. I mean, it used to be an advantage in China, probably due to some government support. I think that's a lot of that is gone now. So I think cost of materials in China is really not that much less, labor not necessarily versus the U.S., but versus maybe other parts of Asia the labor has more normalized. I mean, labor is still a bit more expensive in the U.S. but you also get a bit more productivity in the U.S. So, I'm just saying that this is the difference in whereas it used to almost be a two to one advantage to build in China versus the U.S. for any other part of Asia. And you could do it and you could get through permitting and things more quickly, that benefit is vanished. Is there still a 10% advantage, maybe but it's not as large as it used to be. And that's really what I was referring to in my previous comments. But again, it still makes sense to build in China if you're building for materials that are going to be consumed in China, because you get around any tariff issues or any trade war issues, transportation logistics issues. So it can still make sense to build in China. I'm just saying you're not, we would not see the advantage of building in China for something we're going to export to some other part of the region or some other part of the world. P.J. Juvekar: Right, right, with the demographics in China, do you expect sort of these labor costs rising that will continue in the future? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think as the war for talent continues in all parts of the world now, I expect we are in for a period of inflating labor costs really in every region of the world. P.J. Juvekar: Great, great. Thank you for that color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Robert Koort : Thanks so much. Good morning. You mentioned you thought maybe autos will be flat, is there an industry comment or because you're using a mix that is getting richer, you can still grow and what's the latest on the medical stuff, I know during the peak of COVID, you had some diminished demand because of deferral electric procedures, how is that end market trending at the moment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah look, I would say, we expect auto bills to be flat year-on-year, if you look at the industry and globally. Now, I think that changes region to region, I think Asia is doing a bit better. I think Europe's doing a bit worse. I think the U.S. has been between there. I think that's pretty consistent though with an industry view on auto builds. I think, while we all hope the chip shortage was going to improve, I think now every -- most things you read by knowledgeable people say it's probably the end of next year before that starts to improve. So our expectation is auto builds will continue to be flat year-on-year, our own -- what that means for Celanese though, maybe I should call that out because I think it's important is actually we expect our auto volumes to be up 15% next year versus where they were this year, just really as driven by the mix that we have. Again, the higher exposure that we have in EVs than we used to have. EVs have a higher kilogram per vehicle. The presence we have in lithium-ion battery separator films enhanced by the expansion and Bishop that we will finish here at the end of the year. So again, industry wide we expect flat auto builds, we expect there are volume into auto to continue to grow by 15%. And I think your last question Bob, but I will comment -- I think was really around elective procedures for medical and what we're seeing there. Yes, so what I would say is on medical elective procedures have been flat this year. We kept calling out, we expected them to increase, we also didn't expect the delta variant and so what we are really seeing is they're still flat. We're seeing a little bit of pickup in some regions but I would say nothing of significance in terms of our orthopedic side of the medical business. What I will say though, is we have seen a notable pickup in our business for other medical and pharma and it's really on the back of our focus we put on this and our strategy in 2019, trying to expand our presence in other parts of medical and pharma and we did see an increase in that in third quarter which is really what helps kind of keep our mix pretty steady versus second quarter. And just, as an example of the kind of projects that we're bringing in now in medical outside of orthopedics, we've actually just closed the deal to provide palm into dry powder inhaler for a company in India. So this is for an inhaler, uses dry powder, uses our palm is the high value application, with pretty good not just good margins, but good volume going forward. So, that's really where we're starting to see more growth, higher margin business, things like inhalers, things like wearable diabetes devices, obviously still continuing to grow our vital dose, long dose delivery platforms. I mean, we are seeing really good growth in these segments and expect that to continue into next year and beyond. Robert Koort : Perfect, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Lori, going back to your cost curve comments in China, how much of this change do you think is permanent, is any of the 20 odd plants there you think are at risk for perhaps permanent shutdown? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, I mean, this is my personal belief. I mean, I think the advantage to build in China has disappeared and I think that's probably permanent. I think it's like we see generally as you know, as developing economies get more developed and try to get a bigger middle class, strive to increase wages, strive to improve the quality of life for people in that company, they do lose their cost advantage over time. Now they've gained in productivity so I don't think it's that it's going to twitch, I don't think it's going to be cheaper to build in other parts of the world. But I don't think China's ever going to go back to being the super low cost producer of that and that's not necessarily a bad thing. We see China also moving to create more high value materials, more things in China to meet the growing demand of the population in China. So I just don't think they'll always be the huge, low cost exporters that they once were. But we've seen many economies go through that, right. And so who knows what the next economy will be, but they're still the second largest economy in the world. So there's no doubt China will remain a very important part of the world balance and certainly the chemical and polymer world balance in terms of where things come from. Scott Richardson : You know, David and I think if you really looked at technology difference that we've talked about for a long period of time on just the straight variable costs, the advantage that we have is still there. And, with some of the challenges we see in coal and just fundamental usage of coal and that being more and more restricted over time in China, those plants operate at a slightly lower level. Lori talked about catalyst. Catalyst usage of these disadvantaged technologies is higher than what ours is. So we're seeing the costs increase, they're seeing the crops increase at a greater rate. And so that should hopefully, and that's kind of why we've signaled strength as we work our way into 2022 is we do think that there is some changes here that we do believe are sustainable, when then you layer on the fact that supply demand utilizations are getting into the 90% range. David Begleiter : On the back half of the year due to the cost you mentioned, you mentioned there should be similar pressures next year, do we return back to maybe in 2023 prior levels of earnings once these costs normalize? Scott Richardson : David, we lost about half your question. Do you mind re asking that for us? David Begleiter : Sorry, I was actually told you had a step down in earnings here in the back half of the year due to inflation. You've I guess you've highlighted additional pressures continuing to next year. Would you expect to return to normalized levels of tow earnings perhaps in 2023? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look, I think that's a very reasonable assumption. I mean, the real issues other than the issue we had the losing Bellerose volumes this quarter, but we'll place those volumes into other applications next quarter. The things really driving the lower level of tow margins is acetic acid, pricing, is natural gas pricing. So as we get to 2023, just as we expect normalization for acetic acid, we would expect normalization in pricing and we would expect to see margins for tow come up to the level we are seeing as well as of course, that will give us two years to pass through pricing actions on multi-year contracts. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Lori, I had a few related questions on natural gas. I think you made the point in your prepared remarks that due to low levels of inventory, the costs are flowing through maybe a little bit faster than would otherwise be the case. And so with regard to your 4Q earnings guidance, do you think that natural gas or energy inflation will be net positive, negative or neutral? And then the second part would be related to recovery of those costs, I think you mentioned that you're implementing surcharges so perhaps you could comment on where you're doing that if it's Europe or other places and which products? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, so if we look at natural gas. I mean, obviously, natural gas is an issue in the U.S. where we purchase about 55 million BTUs annually. But it's also a real issue in Europe where we don't necessarily purchase much natural gas directly, but we certainly see it as a factor in many of our raw material costs, as well as a factor in our steam and other things that we purchase from others. And so, it has been a significant factor this year. Third quarter is a step up from second quarter. In fourth quarter, we do expect to see another call it 25% increase in the U.S. and a nearly doubling of natural gas prices in the EU. So this will be a significant factor for us in the fourth quarter. Now with the surcharges, with other things we do expect we will be able to recover some of that. I think though, we will see for example in EM another 20 million increase. With the surcharge we're recovering some, but it means we're probably just going to be flat to third quarter to fourth quarter. Not every contract can we put a surcharge on, not every molecule will have a surcharge. Some contracts are fixed for a short period of time. So, we won't be able to recover everything but we do think we'll be able to basically mitigate the impact of the increase from third quarter to fourth quarter. If we stay in the winter months, next year, we'd expect first quarter to be kind of the same level of pricing we see in the fourth quarter. But again, we'll have been able to pass more of those costs on so we should see a bit of help as we move into next year, as it comes to the impact of natural gas pricing on our overall margins. Kevin McCarthy : I see, that's helpful. And then secondly if I may, wanted to ask about the 8 kilotons of production lost in the EM segment. You commented on availability issues around glass, fiber, flame retardants, resins, so wondering if you could kind of talk through those and are they getting any better or worse as far as you can tell in the fourth quarter and beyond, what's your outlook there in terms of ability to produce? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah look, unfortunately, I think it's going to be similar in the fourth quarter. We don't really see an improvement. I mean, fast fiber demand has surged and the ability of the providers to respond to that, especially post freeze. It is just the bids, it's just hard to get them back on and get the production up. So I don't really see probably an improvement in glass fiber in the fourth quarter. We do expect to start seeing some improvement next year. Similarly flame retardants, I mean, that one's a little even more complicated, because pretty much all of the yellow phosphorus that's used to make flame retardants comes out of Yunnan province in China, which was curtailed as part of the energy curtailments in Q3 and will probably be impacted in the fourth quarter. So that situation is not going to get better. Probably again, this year, hopefully we'll get better next year. But there right now, it's just a single source of this raw material, and it happens to be in China. So we need to -- we need a bit more time to understand what the energy curtailments are going to mean, going forwards. Really know when that issue is going to resolve itself. And resins I would say are mostly resolved at this point in time. I don't expect resin availability to be as much of an issue in the fourth quarter and certainly not as we move into next year. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew DeYoe from BoA. Your line is now live. Matthew DeYoe : Thanks. I don't expect you to comment on market rumors but, there was one earlier this summer about more or less a ceramics for medical and industrial products companies. And without talking about that one more specifically, I guess, can you help us frame out the scope at which you're looking through valuation -- or M&A and kind of what would fit into the model and what wouldn't fit because it seems like the search is fairly wide I guess, lets start there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah look, I think, as it comes to M&A, whatever you're hearing, I would assume we're looking at everything, anything that is related to end markets that we currently serve, anything that's related to resins that we currently produce or might want to or polymers that we might want to produce. I would just assume if there's a rumor, if something's -- if you see something, we're probably looking at it. Now that said, we look at everything with a lot of discipline, and we look at it through the lens that we laid out at investor day. So we look at we really focus on can we achieve synergies with it, what do we think is our unique ability to get value creation from it, so is it something that we can provide our business models, our project pipelines, our growth models to. All of those criteria\u2019s, where do we think it is in the value chain, we look at -- but we look at everything, we choose very few things to pursue. And so, maybe I would just stop at that. What I will say though is, we think we have a lot of managerial and financial bandwidth in order to complete transactions of any size or multiple transactions of a smaller size. So, at the time of the Investor Day, we said we outlined about a $6 billion, having $6 billion available on our balance sheet in order to do M&A. I will tell you even with the expected close of Santoprene here in December, we still think we have about $6 billion available to us on our balance sheet, because of our higher earnings that we've had this year, and what that's meant in terms of cash generation and where our balance sheet is at. So I mean, assume we look at everything, assume we continue to look at it through the criteria we laid out at Investor Day, and know that we have a very large pot of money ready to go when we find the right opportunity. And we have a management team that's ready to both, negotiate and integrate. Matthew DeYoe : That's helpful. Thanks. Just wanted to talk about a little bit on the EM side with the Nat gas costs, I guess I was a little surprised that downstream ops would have that much exposure directly to Nat gas, is that just a reflection of like European energy costs moving up or is there some -- is Nat gas more directly a feedstock to or is it just the acetic pass through I guess, I'm just wondering? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, I mean, if you think about it, in the U.S. just about everything is a derivative of natural gas. So, even in the U.S. we've seen almost a doubling of natural gas costs from say last year to this year, to the current price this year. But if you think about CO, if you think about methanol, I mean, in the U.S. these are all natural gas derivatives. So there is a kind of direct correlation to raw material feedstock. Having natural gas though for Acetyl from an energy standpoint, like -- this is very small, because actually acetic acid is exothermic, it is heat integrated with others downstream. So not kind of the inverse of what you think. It is a big deal for raw materials, we tend to be able to pass that through, not such a big deal in terms of direct cost of energy in our U.S. operations. In Europe, again more EM exposure. Most EM tends to be lower energy intensity, but then compounding really doesn't require much energy. But something like palm requires a lot of energy. So you think about palm, right, you have to heat it, you have to crystallize it, you have to dry it so that takes a lot of energy. So there, we really do see the direct impact of natural gas, which is almost doubled from third quarter to what we expect in the fourth quarter. And its kind of four times what it was in the third quarter or in the second quarter. There you see a very direct relationship, and one that's a little harder to pass through, because it really has to do with steam, steam costs, and electricity costs, and all those sorts of things. Matthew DeYoe : Understood, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now live. Frank Mitsch : Hey, good morning and congrats on the nice results. Just curious with the step down that we're seeing in the acetate tow market, can you comment on where you feel that fits within the Celanese portfolio? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, Frank, I mean, as you know, we constantly look at everything in our portfolio and look at where we think the long term trends are, and what does that mean for long-term margin results in the fit in our portfolio. What I would say on tow and similar to my previous comments, is the step down we're seeing right now is we think uniquely tied to the price of the acetic acid and energy prices around the globe. And clearly, the biggest piece of that being energy prices in Europe and [indiscernible] plant. So, we do believe that we'll see a normalization of pricing both raw materials and energy and with that, we expect to continue to enjoy high margins in tow. But, like all of our portfolio, we will continue to watch that and make strategic decisions accordingly, as we move through the next few years. Scott Richardson : Yeah, and Frank, I mean, I think it's important to remember, I mean, this is still between both the base business and the dividends that come out of the JV. This generates a lot of cash for us, and that cash can then be deployed for higher growth application. So, we saw last year the importance of having this business when we saw the downturn, very solid results, very solid cash flow generation, and yeah, we're seeing some near term compression, but as Lori said, we do expect some level of normalization. Frank Mitsch : That's very helpful. And just a clarification, in terms of your energy costs year-over-year, just reading through the prepared remarks, so it's 20 million negative impact in Q3, an additional 20 million negative in Q4. So we should assume like year-over-year, higher energy is going to cost you 40 million, is that correct? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look those -- that's for EM. I would say we've also seen the impact of those higher energy, impacts on raw material, and that's probably closer to 250 million year-on-year. But we've been able to offset all of that, except didn't anticipate offsetting all of that, except about 20 million through pricing initiative and other initiatives. Frank Mitsch : Got you, very helpful. Thank you. Scott Richardson : Kevin, let's make the next question our last one, please. Operator : Certainly, our final question today is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Laurence Alexander : Good morning, two quick ones then. Can you touch on given the improved structural outlook for acetyls, why not pull forward CAPEX to sort of fill in the pipeline, the industry pipeline in 2026 to 2028? And on the carbon pricing, to the extent that carbon prices move higher, are your EM customers giving you any sense of how that factors into pricing for your products, are you seeing any kind of favorable mix shifts or negative from that and similarly, within acetyls is there a certain level of carbon prices where some of the Acetyl Chain becomes disadvantage relative to substitutes? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look I think in response to your first question, not just for acetyls but for EM, we continue to look at our ability to pull forward all of our products because, my margins are high [ph] and we believe that that structural demand is there. Similarly, in EM we can sell everything we can make right now. And we expect that to continue as the desire for high quality unique products like we make continues to grow. So we actually look at what we constantly have been looking at, how do we pull all of these up. The limitations are really the actual time it just takes to do a project between permitting which unfortunately has been slowed down in most parts of the world, because of COVID. All the way it is just the ability to get raw materials. And we talked a little bit about steel, but concrete everything, there's so much demand right now for construction projects, that we're finding it difficult to pull our projects up in a meaningful way. But we'll continue to look at that and we'll continue to update you as we move through the year.  And then on your second question, what I would say is, for most of the high value products that we produce in EM, customers just want the product. I mean, we've had three consecutive quarters of price increases in EM, kind of the first time in our history. And what we find is that is not impacting the desire of our customers to take products. So I think in the inflationary environment, we're all experiencing on everything people understand. They may not like it, but they understand why we're having to push through these price increases to cover raw materials and energy. And again have not seen any loss of volume due to pricing. I would say the same thing really in acid and downstream, Acetyl Chain derivatives, the demand for construction products and packaging, and all these things that the acetyls go into is only increasing and even at the higher prices. I mean, people maybe have been a bit slower to refill inventory at these prices, but there's no material anyway available to refill inventory. So again, we've not -- our customers would take more at these prices if we could produce more. We'll just leave it at that. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Kevin. We'd like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call if you have any further questions. Kevin, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President, Investor Relations. Brandon, you may now begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Rob. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President, Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its fourth quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today\u2019s presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we published our remarks yesterday, we\u2019ll go ahead and open the lines for questions. Rob, please go ahead and open the line. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And our first question today comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. John Roberts : Thank you. You mentioned you\u2019re not expecting another shutdown at Nanjing or any disruptions from the Olympics. Do you think China can get from a zero COVID strategy to an endemic COVID environment like the U.S. and Europe without a lot more disruptions? Lori Ryerkerk : That\u2019s an interesting question, John. We\u2019re really not \u2013 we said we weren\u2019t expecting any disruptions. It was really around energy curtailments or things like we saw in the October timeframe. Also with Chinese New Year\u2019s and Beijing, a little bit differently than we\u2019ve seen prior to 2020. We\u2019re not seeing as many total shutdowns during that period as China worries about their economy and wants to see recovery. So we\u2019ve modeled in only mild seasonality across our businesses for Chinese New Years and for the Olympics. The COVID question is an interesting one. I\u2019d say COVID seems well under control in China, at least from officially reported. But we would also say, our experience in our plants and our offices is \u2013 COVID is under control. And I think you\u2019ve seen some recent comments by the Chinese government, where they are starting to back away from their zero COVID strategy and more towards managing endemic. So I do believe, I think the outcome of all what I\u2019ve just said is, I \u2013 my personal belief is that we will see a fairly smooth transition in China as they go as much of the rest of the world is towards more of managing is endemic versus sticking with their zero COVID policy. John Roberts : Okay. And could you talk a little bit about about the M&A outlook. Santoprene appears off to a good start. And \u2013 but what are the areas of Celanese that you\u2019re most interested in expanding? Is it another polymer like Santoprene? Or is it maybe something in Asia after the poly plastics transaction? Or maybe something in chemicals like the redispersible polymers you did? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So, look, Santoprene, we are really excited about Santoprene. The transition went really well over December. Even just one month in, we\u2019re already starting to see delivery up from synergies that are ahead of schedule. We\u2019re excited about what we see from the product and where we see the possibilities for cross-selling, as well as new applications for Santoprene. And of course, we\u2019re really excited about not just the assets we acquired, but the people we acquired. And the great job that they\u2019ve done really coming into Celanese and becoming part of the Celanese family. So you\u2019re right. Santoprene, we think has been a great success so far, and we anticipate it just gets better from here. And makes us excited about a future M&A as well in our ability to continue to do larger and larger M&A. To \u2013 in answer to your question about what type of M&A, I would say yes. We are looking at everything that you mentioned. We\u2019re looking at additional polymers, different additional geography. We are looking at acquisitions across both Engineered Materials and the Acetyl Chain. So I would say, our lens is still fairly wide open in terms of the types of M&A that we would consider and in terms of size all the way from bolt-on to transformational. So we think it\u2019s quite an exciting time for us for M&A. Not only do we still have the financial capability to do a significant amount of M&A, but we also believe we have the management and employ bandwidth and capability. And again, especially with some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve done with the Elotex and Santoprene bring in even more talent to take on additional M&A going forward. John Roberts : Thank you, Lori. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Thanks very much. In your script describing M&A, you said that you are considering a wide range of opportunities within your desired investment-grade rating. Does that indicate that your acquisition aspirations are more modest, rather than transformative? Lori Ryerkerk : I wouldn\u2019t make that assumption, Jeff. If you look at our actual financial capability, if you look at by cash, the free cash flow we had this year at $1.3 billion, next year will be at $1.4 billion. If you look at our cash flow, we actually think we have a very large capacity to take on debt. We\u2019re very low levered right now. We could take on significant debt and we could take on \u2013 with the cash flow we have, we could pay off that debt. So I wouldn\u2019t say that these are \u2013 our ambitions are modest. I\u2019d say, actually, we\u2019re in the best time in our history to actually take on any range of M&A and still do it within our investment-grade rating. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Duffy Fischer : Yes, good morning. First question is just on the Acetyl Chain. When you look at the different steps from acetic acid down to VAM and some of the other derivatives, where do you see the supply demand being the tightest over the next couple of years? And where do you think either you or the industry might make some announcements around new capacity in that chain over the next couple of years? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say the entirety of the chain is pretty tight right now. Just look at utilization. Acetic acid had been pretty close to 100%. Now that did moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, but still 85% to 90% utilization in acetic acid, we see that being about the same this quarter and maybe timing a little bit as we go through the year. But we do have some new capacity coming on sometime in the next few months with the second phase of yeqingjiee [ph]. VAM is very tight. I would say VAM has been around 100% utilization for some time now. It was a little bit better in the fourth quarter. But again, in the first quarter, we see it being really tight again, as we have some outages, especially in China for turnarounds as well as the maintenance downtime. So, I think VAM is going to continue to be very tight. We\u2019ve announced some expansions in VAM. There\u2019s been a few other ones, but I think the demand in VAM continues to grow quite rapidly. And then if you go into our downstream products, like emulsions and RDP, I would say, the demand is huge right now. There\u2019s some really interesting things happening in the market now around increased energy efficiency requirements. And we make some systems that are made of \u2013 if you think about kind of five layers of emulsions and RDP powders to make thermal insulation systems for putting on the externals of buildings. And so especially in Europe, we\u2019re just seeing a demand, quite frankly, that the industry can\u2019t keep up with right now. So I\u2019d say you know, those utilization rates are definitely in 100% and staying that way. So I do think we\u2019ll see some expansion. I think as we \u2013 as we\u2019ve called out before acetic acid, any major expansions will take a while, we\u2019re at least four to five years out from any other expansions there other than our Clear Lake capacity that will come on first half of 2022 \u2013 2023, sorry, I get the wrong right year, 2023. And I think we called out some VAM expansions. We\u2019ve called out some VAE expansions we\u2019re making. We are looking to expand RDP as well. And I suspect we\u2019ll see others in the industry doing so. But I will say it\u2019s still into a very tight market. And I think this is a market \u2013 these are markets that will all continue to be very tight for the next, I\u2019m going to say, at least, four to five years. Duffy Fischer : Great, thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up, since you get at acetic acid from kind of all three of the carbon starting points, can you talk about what\u2019s happening to the cost curve for acetic acid with all the different energy price moves we\u2019ve seen in the last half year? What will 2022 look like different than 21 from a cost curve standpoint? Lori Ryerkerk : I think if you look at the last year, we\u2019ve seen everything go up. I mean, natural gas has gone up, including in the Gulf Coast of the U.S.; coal has gone up in China; oil has clearly gone up. And so although everything has gone up and with that, we see methanol prices going up, I would also say it hasn\u2019t changed the relative order of attractiveness. U.S. Gulf Coast natural gas, even at $6 million BTU, as we saw during times in the fourth quarter, is still the most attractive source of raw materials for acetic acid. Coal, oil, kind of stay almost in parity, and it goes back and forth. But I\u2019d say, they\u2019re about the same usually and \u2013 but still significantly more expensive than acetic acid. So I don\u2019t really see the priority. I mean, Gulf Coast, production remains the priority, followed by then Nanjing and Singapore for us, and I don\u2019t really see that changing. And I think what that means is, even with higher natural gas prices, because the marginal capacity in acetic acid is coming out of China, which is coal price, you\u2019ll continue to see prices that support good margins in the Acetyl Chain, as we go forward over the next few years. Scott Richardson : Yes. Duffy, the only thing to add is, I think what has changed from a relative basis is freight and logistics costs. And with our network of having the three assets, that just gives us the ability to really be well-positioned to meet customer needs around the world. So while the cost for others has moved up, who only have one plant, our network just gives us a nice advantage there to take advantage of the fact that those logistics costs have moved up pretty rapidly. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you, guys. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Pleased proceed with your questions. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, Lori. This is actually Mike, sitting in for Bob this morning. And I was wondering in your prepared comments, you kind of talked about an expectation of acetyls industry pricing moderating in the first quarter. I was wonder if you could give us perhaps maybe a bit more color around the magnitude of moderation you may be baking into your guide. Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. Look, we call out moderation in the first quarter. And really, throughout the remainder of this year, really assuming we don\u2019t see the amount of supply disruption that we had in this year. I mean, this year between the free \u2013 and the free, some large turnaround in the U.S., in particular, than the curtailment in China in October, we had quite a lot of disruption in the supply chain for acetic acid. And with that, it tends to keep prices higher with the uncertainty that\u2019s out there, on top of what\u2019s been very robust demand for acetic acid and Acetyl Chain products this year. So as we go into 2022, and we saw it in the fourth quarter, we saw after the peak in October, driven by the curtailments in China and kind of more of the perception of the curtailments in China, we saw very rapid moderation through November and December. And we expect that \u2013 first quarter is actually probably kind of flattish with where we ended the year, but then we do expect further curtailment as we go through the rest of the year, assuming no big supply disruptions. Obviously, if we get into a period where we have major supply disruptions, we could see some price support again for higher acetic acid prices, but that is the basis for our assumptions this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, if memory serves me, the \u2013 there typically is like a seasonal, I guess, rebound in pricing and kind of that second and third quarter. Do you anticipate that or do you see the moderation continuing through what has historically been a seasonal rebound? Lori Ryerkerk : What I would say, Mike, is usually, we see a seasonal softening around Chinese New Year As production \u2013 as consumers are shut down in China during that period of time, and a lot of factories shut down for a couple weeks of folks getting station. We\u2019re really \u2013 we\u2019re not putting much of that in our forecast for first quarter because we\u2019re \u2013 we have a minor amount of seasonality that we put in first quarter. So as a result of not seeing much seasonality in first quarter, I wouldn\u2019t expect much rebound in second quarter and third quarter, just because we\u2019re not baked in much of a dip in the first quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Sison : Hey, good morning. Lori, just curious in the third quarter prepared remarks, you talked about 2023, and I know 2023 is more of a guideline versus specific guidance at this point. But they still feel good about sort of that $15.23 and growth beyond that Lori Ryerkerk : We do Mike. We\u2019ve called out greater than $15 EPS this year. And for those of you who\u2019ve done the math, you probably realize that our numbers, if you add them up, come a little bit closer to $16. If you look at the \u2013 called \u2013 what we\u2019ve called out for individual businesses, look, we\u2019re just trying to be prudent with the $15. We\u2019re feeling good about 2022. And what we see there if conditions continue to exist, and we start seeing improvement in supply chain, and some of those things, obviously, our number could move well above $15 for 2022. And therefore even with more moderation in acetyls in 2023, offset by growth in Engineered Materials in 2023, we feel really good at that greater than $15 number for 2023 and for the years beyond. Michael Sison : Got it. And then I guess for EM, you\u2019re looking for another \u2013 for a good year in organic volume growth again. Any changes to your sort of view on auto, I think, it did come in a little bit better, as you noted in the fourth quarter? And how does that affect your outlook for \u2013 or how\u2019s that embedded in your outlook for 2022? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, great question. Really for automotive, I would say, Q4 didn\u2019t come back as strongly in automotive, as most of the tiers and other people predicted. It did come back a little bit in Q4, but not nearly to the extent we expected. I mean, if you just look at Q4 of this year, it\u2019s still well below Q4 of 2020. So there\u2019s still a lot of recovery to come in auto. Now we are not \u2013 in our modeling, we\u2019re not projecting as much recovering in auto as maybe IHS is. So, if IHS is right, which we hope they are, that will be additional upside for us. We\u2019re assuming actually auto volumes are pretty flat in 2022 versus 2021. Now we continue to increase content into auto. So ourselves and auto continue to go up. But we are projecting fairly flat total auto builds. But again, that leaves us upside if we do see autos coming back more strongly like IHS is predicting. Michael Sison : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you, and hello, everyone. Lori, maybe just picking up on the comments on China, as you sort of think about 4Q in the acetic acid and VAM pricing fate that you referenced in your prepared comments in the region, is that just \u2013 I mean, realizing there\u2019s a lot going on? Is that just a function of the economy having slowed in China with real estate, et cetera, and that continues in the first quarter? And then just your view in terms of the recent stimulus measures that have been announced in the country. How do you see that sort of playing forward for Celanese beyond the first quarter? You\u2019ve given very specific guidance for 1Q, but just on the Acetyl Chain, beyond that would be helpful as well. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If we go back to fourth quarter, it was really an interesting phenomena. If you look in October, we saw coal prices run up due to some geopolitical things that were going on. With that, we saw methanol pricing run up. And with that \u2013 and then we had the curtailments being announced in China. And I think there was a huge concern that acetic acid plants, VAM plants we\u2019re going to shut down. And so we saw price shoot up to $1,300 per metric ton. That was a very short impact, though. It\u2019s kind of a one week phenomenon. And then when people realize not much acetic acid was being shut down, we saw acetic acid prices come down back to that 850 and then even into the 750 range as we moved into the end of the year. Now that\u2019s still a good pricing for acetic acid. We haven\u2019t really seen much demand \u2013 and much softening in demand in China. So despite the things we read about the economy, that construction slowdown, we haven\u2019t seen much softening in demand in China. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying really, for first quarter, we think we will probably going to be fairly steady at about that same range of level that we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. And I think as we go through the rest of the year, we\u2019re calling out moderation. And again, we\u2019re just calling that out on assuming supply stabilizes throughout the world in the supply chain and demand remained fairly steady. And that really is our outlook for China, to your further question. Even at slower economic growth, a lot of that is coming in high tech, it\u2019s coming in more social media platforms and things like that, that China is intentionally wanting to shut down, we\u2019re seeing China clamp down a little bit on real estate, and some of the speculative stuff that was going on in China. But we\u2019re not seeing much impact on industrial. We\u2019re not seeing much impact on consumer demand. And we\u2019re not seeing much impact, even on a lot of the construction segments that we\u2019re in like people redoing buildings and adding insulation, and all those sorts of thing. So outlook is still pretty robust for China, throughout the entirety of the year in 2022. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. And then on the EM margins down somewhere between 500 and 600 basis points below \u201818, and sorry, yes \u201818 to \u201819 levels. I know the mix has changed a bit. But as a previous \u2013 prior high watermark still realistic, sort of pro forma of the acquisitions, including Santoprene? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I\u2019d say like, look, our expectations for acquisitions is the same, just given the nature of the business when we got Santoprene, that came in with a little bit lower margins. But we\u2019re very confident that as we work through the year, as we see recovery in auto, as we have a chance to take commercial actions around pricing and other things with Santoprene, that we\u2019ll be able to get them up to the expectations we have for the rest of our business. And that would be our expectations for any other acquisitions that we look at that we get back to similar levels of margins. Scott Richardson : Yes, and I think, Ghansham, with what we saw from a run up in energy costs broadly across the EM portfolio, we knew it\u2019s going to take some time. And as we called out in the prepared remarks, we do expect to get ahead of that here by the end of the first quarter. And then you should see margins improve here in both with Santoprene and the base business in the second half of the year. Ghansham Panjabi : Awesome. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Good morning. Lori, I was wondering if you could talk through the energy spike in Europe, as energy costs there quadruple or quintuple? How are you dealing with that? And in practical terms, and with regard to efforts to recover, how much might be permanent price increases versus surcharges? How should we think about the energy pig moving through the Python as the year progresses? Lori Ryerkerk : I love the way you put that that\u2019s \u2013 we haven\u2019t talked about in those terms. But that is what it feels like right now. So, what the spikes we saw in third quarter and then the even greater spikes that we saw in fourth quarter are really unprecedented. It\u2019s I think, was pretty clear from the chart. And I mean, it\u2019s been really volatile. Typically, if you look, we don\u2019t do \u2013 we do some hedging around energy prices in other parts of the world and even in Europe, but we really do it to get security of supply. We do it to reduce volatility. We often do hedge in the fourth quarter and first quarter in the winners when we know. We\u2019re more likely to get price increases. With what happened in Europe, it was so unprecedented. And so came at such a fast rate, we really didn\u2019t have that opportunity at all. So that\u2019s what we had to pass through those costs to our consumers. We chose to do it through a surcharge, because it can reflect to our customers. It is temporary and it is based on an unusual set of events. Look, no one likes a price increase. But I think that by doing it as a surcharge, our customers understand that this is a temporary measure. And we\u2019re really not seeing any tangible loss of volume from customers : one, because everybody is experiencing these price increases; and two, some of the supply logistic constraints right now make it really hard for people to source from other places. But as we go forward, we do expect prices to moderate again. We are taking some steps to try to protect ourselves in the future from these kinds of run up. And look, some of the price increases we\u2019ve had that were just price increases based on other raw materials, we\u2019ll see the benefit of those four sometimes to come. Because these are value priced items, that those price increases will stick for a while. The surcharge will go away when the energy price goes away. But as we called out in our remarks, we do expect with the other \u2013 with the increases we\u2019ve had to add on the surcharges, that sometime in the first quarter, we\u2019ll be recovering all of the additional energy pricing that we\u2019ve experienced. Kevin McCarthy : Okay, thank you for that. And then secondly, I want to ask about your range of $15-plus or, call it, $15 to $16 for 2022. Just recognizing that it\u2019s a really dynamic external environment with lots of dislocations. Just broadly, what do you think are the two or three biggest swing factors that could allow you to over-deliver or under deliver versus that target level? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, the number one factor, and it\u2019s what we saw this year is acetic acid pricing and Acetyl value Chain pricing. I mean, while we can do a lot with commercial actions, and with the agility and kind of the commercial expertise of our teams, and we do that by managing volumes around the world and up and down the chain. Base pricing still matters. And so to the extent, we see supply tightness, whether they be from weather events, whether they be from unplanned shutdowns, supply tightness in a market that is at, let\u2019s say, 85% to 90% utilization, it reflects very quickly in increased prices in the Acetyl Chain. So to the extent that we have more disruption and volatility in the Acetyl Chain market this year. We\u2019ll see pricing go up, and that would give us additional uplift on that outlook for the year. Inflation is obviously an issue as a supply chain. And so we\u2019re assuming the supply chain restrictions we see this year moderate over the course of the year. We\u2019re not assuming that perfect, but we are assuming they\u2019re starting to moderate over the course of the year. If we see that not happen, that will have some impact. But as you saw those numbers are in the 10s and 20s of millions in a quarter, not hundreds, like we would see acetyl pricing. And then for EM, I think, auto recovery is a big issue. Again, we\u2019ve assumed pretty flat auto between 2021 and 2022, based on chip shortages. But if we see that resolved, and there\u2019s some good upside for Engineered Materials in there for increased sales into auto. Kevin McCarthy : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Pleased proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned in the prepared comments in the Acetyl Chain that your RDP business \u2013 the volumes were up, I think, you said 25% versus their historical peak and that should be shifting more of your mix there and I guess, broader emulsions in 2022. So could you just talk to us a little bit about what\u2019s happening in RDP, that was allowing that volume performance? Is it something you were doing with the asset and or new ownership? Is it the market? Is it both? Where\u2019s the demand coming from in terms of segments? Or is it shifting from other products? But just give us a little more color on what\u2019s happening there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah, look, we\u2019ve seen very strong demand and pricing from the construction sector specifically for emulsions and powders. So whether it be paints and coatings or these insulation systems that I talked about earlier, we are seeing very strong demand there. And as a lot of countries put in additional energy efficiency requirements, or greenhouse gas footprint reduction requirements, we expect that we will continue to see very strong demand continue for emulsions and powders. I think what\u2019s changed there is with our acquisition of Elotex, which let us get into the RDP market, we\u2019ve been able to take those assets, we\u2019ve been able to do bottleneck them quickly, we\u2019ve able to run them harder, because we\u2019re vertically integrated. We will run them full because we still see the value of the acetic acid that\u2019s going into them coming out as RDP, may be something that someone who\u2019s not vertically integrated would struggle to do. And so we\u2019ve just been able to run them harder. We\u2019ve also been able to get more, I guess, I\u2019d say, innovative in terms of marketing our emulsions and RDP together as a package, which allows customers in some of these things like the thermal insulation systems to buy a system of products that works for their needs versus having to go source them independently. And so commercially, that\u2019s been a big win for us and something we think is really going to secure the sector and improve the margins of the sector going forward. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the auto comments, when you\u2019re talking about autos for 2022, you\u2019re obviously, speaking to your own volume and what your expectations are. You also mentioned in the prepared remarks about the tiers were doing some destocking in the fourth quarter. I just wanted to understand whether was that just sort of typical fourth quarter destocking for working capital purposes? Or was just a function of a built too much inventory in 4Q \u2013 sorry in 2021 versus what the chips allowed them to do? And is that destocking done? Or is it something that could be a feature of this year as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, great question. So our belief is we saw really good demand still in third quarter, despite a low level of auto bills in third quarters. And our belief is the tiers were continuing to build inventory in anticipation of a really robust fourth quarter. With chip demand \u2013 with chip availability being what it was, fourth quarter did come back, but not as strongly as everybody expected. And then it was year-in, so the tiers chose to just pay do some destocking over the quarter, so that they didn\u2019t have the earn-in inventories quite as high. We still believe inventories are very low in the tiers. And so we don\u2019t expect that to be an ongoing phenomena. We think it was simply a year-in phenomena. We expect to see demand come back robustly in first quarter and on through the rest of the year, based on improved auto builds, but also based on the tiers need to rebuild inventory. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the thoughts. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. P.J. Juvekar: Yes. Hi, good morning, Lori and Scott. Lori Ryerkerk : Hi P.J. P.J. Juvekar: In China you and your competitors were impacted by dual control. And I think dual control has ended now, and they built up their coal inventories and dual control has ended. What does that mean for more acetyls production in China? Do you see that happening? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I definitely see the ability for that to happen. If we look at the curtailment in China, we lost about 25,000 tons of lost production, about half of that was VAM and the other half was a combination of acetic acid and other derivatives. So that was about 20 million to 25 million of loss margin due to that curtailment. So assuming we don\u2019t have any curtailment and that\u2019s obviously volume that we can produce into the system. And our expectation is the same as yours. We don\u2019t see any indications, we\u2019ll have curtailments this year either. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then Europe has been difficult for many companies, as oil prices went up and there was limited pricing. How is your European operation holding up, in general, as a region? And can you just make any comments on what you\u2019re seeing going forward? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really seen any major impacts on our business from the increase in oil pricing. I mean, as we \u2013 as we\u2019ve called out before, generally, we do better with higher pricing in acetyls that can get passed through immediately, it takes a little bit longer in EM. But generally, we do better with higher pricing. The real impact we\u2019ve had this year has been from natural gas in Europe and the impact that that\u2019s had on specifically our EM operations in Europe, as well as our tow operations in Europe, where we just, in those contracts, don\u2019t haven\u2019t had the opportunity to pass on the additional cost of natural gas and utilities based on natural gas through to the consumer real-time. We\u2019ve had a lag in that pass-through pricing. Scott Richardson : But I do think, P.J., the one thing that we do love is having in region capacity. And our assets in Europe are running at a high rate with the supply chain issues and the issues around logistics and product coming in from other regions that has helped us be able to sustain and offset some of these increases in raw materials. P.J. Juvekar: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Lori, in the prepared comments, you called out some turnaround costs in acetyls in both Q1 and Q2. Can you quantify those costs? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If we look at 2021, we had a total of right around $40 million in turnaround costs, and in 2022, we expect that to be about the same. Last year, it was spread across a wider variety of assets. This year, our large turnarounds will be the two we called out. We have an \u2013 Fairway has a turnaround in the first quarter and then we have a Clear Lake acetic acid plant turnaround that starts at the end of the first quarter and goes into the second quarter. David Begleiter : Very good. And just back to M&A. If you are unable to make a transformational acquisition in EM, could you \u2013 would you ramp up organic spending in that business? Lori Ryerkerk : We\u2019re still planning on high organic spending. I mean, we are planning on 600 million capital. Next year, part of that is completion of the Panther project in the acetyls business. But the rest of the \u2013 most of the rest of that is really in Engineered Materials, where we\u2019ll be spending about the same amount we spent for Panther as we do some of our expansion projects and new builds in China, and will really all parts of the world. So I\u2019d say the M&A is not having a big impact on our view of organic investment. Organic investments continues to be our highest return. And so we\u2019ve ramped those projects up as we see our ability to strategically and efficiently deploy capital. So I don\u2019t think that will have a \u2013 make a difference in terms of our organic investments. David Begleiter : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori and Scott. A question around you guys is sort of relative degree of quality satisfaction with your upstream integration. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve seen some seismic shifts over the last couple of months, be it the European natural gas situation, the new five-year plan presented in China, obviously, looking for significant curtailments in coal usage. So as you\u2019ve sort of seen all of those things, does that make you sort of rethink, maybe the integration strategy, maybe that should be more integrated? I don\u2019t know how you guys are thinking about that with with some of these goings on. Lori Ryerkerk : Hassan, I assume you\u2019re thinking more about integration in terms of upstream. Hassan Ahmed : Upstream integration, correct. Yes. Lori Ryerkerk : \u2026into the Acetyl Chain. Yes. Hassan Ahmed : Indeed. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we \u2013 look, right now, we get about \u2013 we produce about 40% of our own ethanol. We kind of like that balance of being able to produce methanol, or buy methanol, depending where the markets are and what the sources of value are. We\u2019re pretty happy with that. We constantly reevaluate and look at opportunities to go further upstream. But I would say, right now, we\u2019re pretty happy at about that 40% range we\u2019re at. Scott Richardson : Yes, and with the methanol expansions we\u2019ve already announced this on, I mean, that\u2019s going to be able to take and help us with some of the growth that we expect, largely in the Acetyl Chain over the next several years. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, understood. And just also wanted to revisit M&A. I mean, you guys talked about considering anything from bolt-on to transformational. Just \u2013 I just wanted to get a better sense of if you guys have a preference for preference or not for certain regions. The only reason I bring that up is they seem to be some chunky assets in Europe that the are spinning low, looking to be acquired, I\u2019m thinking in terms of the DSM plastics unit, the [indiscernible] HBN business. I mean, the question really is you guys have a sizable presence in Europe as is. Would you consider doubling down on Europe? Would you be dissuaded by that? Just reasonably how you\u2019re thinking about M&A? Lori Ryerkerk : Hassan, I would say I am geographically agnostic. I am \u2013 it is all about value for me. So we look at all M&A targets for the opportunities to create value for Celanese. I mean, clearly, we want it to be a good strategic fit. But we really look at synergies and all the other aspects of a deal to make sure that something that we believe will create outside value for Celanese and our shareholders. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is form the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in the Acetyl Chain, you guys demonstrated this past quarter, again, the kind of ability to flex the global network to take advantage of kind of regional changes in price and what have you. I guess, how did you do that given all the freight and logistics constraints that are out there? And I guess as those start to alleviate, does that give you even more shots on goal and more opportunities? How should we be thinking about that? Lori Ryerkerk : I think you\u2019re right. I mean, I think fourth quarter continues to demonstrate the real strength of the business model we have in acetyls. I think there you really see kind of the breadth of our manufacturing footprint being present in three different geographies. The agility of our supply chain is \u2013 made us really good, I would say even better at adapting to and capitalizing on disruptions, which we\u2019ve seen a lot this year. And I think the performance of our acetyl team is really impressive this year, if you look at all of the opportunities we had to not be agile, they\u2019ve really taken advantage of it and create a lot of value for the company this year. I think you see that we really focused on China this year, the prices were very high. But at the very end of the year, the team was able to shift AC sales more to the Western Hemisphere, where prices held up longer. In fact, fourth quarter, we saw the highest percent of our volume going into the Western Hemisphere that we have this year. It was about a 10% swing, from China to the Western Hemisphere. Similarly, we saw swings out of acetic acid and more into VAM, emulsions and RDP. And I think that is the value of what we have with kind of end-to-end value chain as well as geographic diversity. I would say, look, we\u2019ve had some issues around supply chain logistics and freight like many of them, and like many folks have. But I would also say, our team has been amazingly resilient and flexible, and securing chip, securing whatever they needed to do and making sure we could move things as we needed to really maximize the value of that chain. Look, like anybody, it took us a little bit longer in some cases to fill out those value chains. But I would say, we\u2019re through that now and have the lead times in place to really be able to continue to take advantage of them. John McNulty : Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a question for Scott around, again, the M&A commentary. And I guess, just given the significant cash flows that you guys have been throwing off, maybe more so than in some expected, I guess, can you help us to understand what or how much you can stress or flex the balance sheet and still keep the \u2013 still keep your investment-grade rating? Can you go north of four times? Is that kind of a leverage hurdle that\u2019s doable in your mind, just given the strength of the cash flows? I guess, how should we think about that? Scott Richardson : Well, John, I mean, every deal is going to be unique and different. And I think a lot of depends upon how much EBITDA we\u2019re buying, and then what the makeup of the various assets would be that would be in that type of situation. So, I mean, I would say it really depends. And I think we are really focused on making sure we generate a lot of cash. And Lori talked about synergies being critical in any deal. And I think depending on levels of synergies, it\u2019s going to really dictate what we could do from a balance sheet perspective. And it really comes down to cash generation. We feel really good about 2022 at $1.4 billion. And we think that cash generation with the the growth in earnings that we project in the coming years is going to continue to be quite robust. John McNulty : Fair enough. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. Pleased proceed with your questions. Matthew Blair : Hey, good morning. Maybe sticking on the M&A topic, Lori, I thought the comments that you\u2019re looking at M&A in the Acetyl Chain were pretty interesting, just given your large market position. Would this be something more downstream like emulsions? Or do you think you could consolidate acetic acid and VAM capacity in other parts of the world? Lori Ryerkerk : That\u2019s a fair question, Matthew. Look, we do have a large position already in the Acetyl Chain. So things as we look at M&A for the Acetyl Chain, it is things more like Elotex. So, further downstream in the value chain, that is more likely possibilities than, say, any kind of a big M&A around acetic acid or some of those products \u2013 those products where we already have a fairly large position. Matthew Blair : Got it. And then in the prepared comments you noted that you\u2019re immediately sold out of the Bishop GUR clamp that just started up. Are there any like low-cost expansion opportunities here? Or is it pretty much set at 15 kg? Lori Ryerkerk : There are \u2013 we have been doing the low-cost expansions as we can. Our engineers are looking very hard at that. Obviously, GUR markets have continued to expand and grow at a rate much faster than anticipated. We grew nearly 40% this last year. And so the expansion that we built in Bishop, which we expected, would last us 12 to 18 months of of growth capacity is now already sold out. So we continuously look for small expansions. The next large expansion we\u2019ve already announced will be in Europe in 2024. Hopefully, we\u2019ll find some more before that. But we are pushing as hard as we can to grow as fast as we can in that area, but just limited right now by our ability to get metal in the ground. Matthew Blair : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on another strong year. I guess, just two questions. So first off, could you just update us maybe on any parts of your portfolio that are still lagging, maybe thinking within the elective procedure side on EM? When do you expect that to get back to normal levels? Lori Ryerkerk : We saw things are in. We saw good growth actually in implants this year, about a 20% improvement over 2020. But you are right, it is still lagging. We\u2019re still kind of 15% to 20% below where we were in 2019. Looking at what the implant makers are saying, we full \u2013 we don\u2019t expect full recovery of implant volumes until we really get into 2023 at this point. Arun Viswanathan : Okay, thanks for that. And I just wanted to again, go back to the question of deployment of cash. I mean, there\u2019s \u2013 again, there\u2019s quite a robust trajectory here from the billion for and potentially growth from there over the next couple of years as you bring on these investments. So does it make sense at least to potentially accelerate the capital return in light of so high valuation multiples? Or are you looking to continue the inorganic growth side? Scott Richardson : Well, I think, I mean, as Lori said earlier, I mean, our focus is always on organic growth first, historically our highest return projects. And we\u2019ve got $600 million earmarked this year for capital to invest back in ourselves. And then what we\u2019ve historically done is take that free cash flow and this year at $1.4 billion, and then deploy that for to service the dividend and then for repurchases and M&A. And that\u2019s \u2013 with where the dividends at, that\u2019s likely going to be somewhere in the billions, probably more than $1 billion of capital that we\u2019ll be able to deploy back with that for M&A and for repurchases. So, I think that focus really hasn\u2019t changed. And given with that cash generation, we think it just presents more opportunity for us. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning. You have a fairly sizable nylon compounding business. If you look at transition to EVs, do you think nylon has risks related to content loss because of choosing high heat applications, or users still in that content game because of new nylon applications? Lori Ryerkerk : It\u2019s a great question and one we\u2019re hearing a lot. Our belief is we don\u2019t expect a decline in nylon with the move to EVs. There are a lot of applications for nylon in EV. So the high speed connectors, the powertrain, and obviously body the interior nylons, really good for lightweighting and still being able to get strength and dimensional stability. In fact, we\u2019ve had a few new applications using nylon into EV, so we have a cell strand [ph] application that\u2019s going into a tailgate on electric vehicles, for example. So it\u2019s lightweight, it has good appearance, high strength, it saves money because it\u2019s one piece versus two pieces. So we really see more, I would say, at least equal, if not more opportunities for nylon into EVs as we\u2019re in conventional vehicles. Scott Richardson : Yes, Alek, I also wouldn\u2019t underestimate the power of recycled nylon. And this has been one of the things that we have gained through acquisition and we\u2019ve been really growing that ECOMID part of our nylon portfolio. As our customers look for more and more recycled content, nylon is a great material to recycle. And the opportunities that we have in the portfolio of grades that we continue to grow has been a really nice area of acceleration for us. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : I would also say there\u2019s a lot of nylon in things associated with EVs, like the charging stations and other electrification components. So outside the vehicle itself, we see a lot of new applications developing for nylon. Aleksey Yefremov : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot. And on excess inventories of your EM products at the tier suppliers, do you have a sense of they have, I don\u2019t know, one or two or five months of that excess inventory? And also, do you yourself have any excess auto product inventory? Lori Ryerkerk : So I think the last one first, we do not have excess inventory. We have hardly inventory at all, this has been a year where we could pretty much sell anything we could make. Our belief is the tiers aren\u2019t sitting there with a lot of inventory. Again, we think it was a year-in phenomena that they decided to just draw down what little bit that they had, and we don\u2019t expect that to continue into 2022. Aleksey Yefremov : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hello, hi, this is Keyshawn [ph] calling on behalf of Steve. Going back to commodity volatility with nat gas prices still being high domestically and abroad. How quickly are costs flowing through a day a little bit faster than expected? And I guess, particularly on the OEM side, as you mentioned, that there\u2019s been a bit of a lag on the ability to pass on higher costs. Lori Ryerkerk : Great question. And we called out a little bit. We started doing energy surcharges in third quarter \u2013 at the end of third quarter. With those surcharges, we were able to recover about $20 million worth of energy costs in the fourth quarter that energy costs skyrocket is far beyond what we expected. So we had about $15 million uncovered by those surcharges in the fourth quarter. We do expect with those surcharges now flowing through that we will get recovery of that sometime in the first quarter. We\u2019ll be at a point where we\u2019re recovering all of that, and then we expect energy prices to be fairly flat for us as we go through the first quarter. So we expect, again, sometime in the first quarter, we should be fully recovering all of that. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned, obviously, the autos rebound, in particular, chip shortage being as possible swing factor for $15 guidance possible upside. Can you give a little bit more color as to what auto OEMs are saying about the shortage? Just overall, this feels like the chip shortage continues to last for longer than expected. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, I think the OEMs are predicting a faster recovery, and some are probably having more success getting chips than others. I would say, we tend to look at HIS. IHS is predicting kind of mid, high single-digit growth globally into next year from this year, which will still be mid to high single digits behind where we were pre-COVID. So they\u2019re not predicting full recovery. But let\u2019s say, kind of half of the way there. Our own outlook, we\u2019ve \u2013 it\u2019s more conservative based on what we\u2019re seeing and what we\u2019re hearing around chip shortages. But \u2013 so that\u2019s where the upside is. If I guess as right, which we all hope they are that chips come back more quickly, and we see that kind of recovery, then we\u2019ll have additional upside in our auto volumes as well. Brandon Ayache : Rob, let\u2019s make the next question, please. Operator : Sure. That question will be coming from the line of [Sanjeev Panda with On Field Investment] [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. The first question is really around your GUR expansion. Could you just tell us like, is this mainly going into the separator market? And if so, is it more a dry versus a wet separator? Because obviously, there\u2019s a huge growth in PVDF in front of us. So just wanted to understand your potential further expansions in GUR in this regard. And then the second question really is sort of around your comments around M&A. I mean, you\u2019ve outlined the sort of strength of the acetyl platform now in terms of also sustainability. So do you think that Celanese in terms of the structure as it is today, with EM and acetyls, is the way to go forward if there is a transformational deal? Or should we think that if there is a transformation, the separate path for those two businesses could \u2013 is also very much on the cards? Thanks a lot. Lori Ryerkerk : Great. Let\u2019s \u2013 so let me take your first question. So the Bishop GUR started up kind of at the end of 2021, that volume is essentially going to support the lithium ion battery separator film growth that I called out earlier, and it is wet for those of you that asked me before. So again, we are looking to expand in every way as quick as we can. Those markets continue to grow very strongly. But our next major expansion in GUR will be in 2024 in Germany, with an expansion that we have there. And then on your second question about M&A. Look, we continue to value having our businesses together. I think we see the advantage of that this year. And I think we\u2019ll see the advantage of that. If we do big at M&A that we get this great cash flow from acetyls, which helps \u2013 which give us more flexibility and capability to support larger M&A. Obviously, we think we have talent advantages for having a bigger group and other advantages about \u2013 because a lot of materials coming out of the Acetyl Chain gets used in Engineered Materials. So we like having the businesses together. As I\u2019ve said on this call before, we never say never. If at some time, we think we would need to separate them to realize the value of the assets, we, of course, would always consider doing what\u2019s best for the shareholder. But at this point in time, we think we see having these businesses together as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks a lot, Lori. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brandon Ayache for closing remarks. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Rob. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we\u2019re around after the call if you have any follow-up questions at all. Rob, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Daryl. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its first quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release, as well as the prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open the line directly for your questions. Daryl, please go ahead and open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Josh Spector : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was just curious on the Engineered Materials' EBIT guidance. I was wondering what's baked in there in terms of volume sequentially. I mean, you're pretty clear about the auto pull-forward, but wonder if there's any other puts and takes around that, assuming you're getting incremental pricing, I assume, you're assuming some volume moderation for 2Q. And then similarly, for the rest of the year thinking about how you're kind of framing up volume expectations for auto end markets and otherwise. Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Josh. As we look at full year, so if we look at 2021 to 2022 we are assuming some volume in there. Some of that is for Santoprene, but there's a couple of percent growth in base business as well. And that really comes about as we see improvements in 2022 versus 2021 and a lot -- the availability of a lot of our raw materials. So things like glass, fiber, things like flame retardants, even some resins that we called out last year. Now that we are getting better supplies of those, we're able to increase our volumes and that really accounts for the base volume increase. And as I said, we do have volume increase in there as well for Santoprene. I would say, we called out auto to be flat year-on-year, so we're not assuming a large increase in volume to auto, although, we do continue to see margin growth in materials into auto, as we continue to high-grade the materials we sell into auto. But I would say, really, strength across all sectors, all of them growing a little bit in that volume. Josh Spector : And then, I guess, just specifically on 2Q and that sequential volume move, are you thinking that volumes are up or down into 2Q, given some of the macro headwinds? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think, in Q2, we're expecting a little less volume. Again, we called out that we had about, what we think, was $10 million to $15 million of volume pull forward from 2Q to 1Q. Again, I think, we called it out in our notes. Really, that was driven by demand being down in 1Q in terms of auto builds, but people wanting to go ahead and rebuild inventory. You might recall that, we had said, fourth quarter, we saw a lot of inventory reduction, as people went to end of the year. And so, we think people were just rebuilding inventory in 1Q. And unless we see a rapid demand, which we're not forecasting, for auto in 2Q, then we would expect to see that $10 million to $15 million not show up in the second quarter, if you will. Josh Spector : Okay Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. P.J. Juvekar:",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Celanese Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Darrel. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer.  Celanese Corporation distributed its second quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website.  Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we have published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll now open -- now turn the call over to Lori for some introductory comments. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Brandon, and thanks to everyone joining us on the call today. Given the macro uncertainty of the world right now, I wanted to take a few minutes to set the tone for this call and reemphasize the priorities we have as a company. As we prepared the earning materials we put out yesterday, I tried to emphasize 2 long-time qualities of Celanese and its employees, and I want to reemphasize them today. Number one, we are fully committed to our objectives. And number two, we are focused on executing on those things that we can control. To these points, we are committed to executing our business model to maximize earnings and cash generation. We are committed to rapidly integrating and synergizing our Santoprene and M&M acquisitions. And we are committed to swiftly executing our deleveraging plan after closing the M&M acquisition. Above all else, we remain committed to these objectives even in the most challenging of environments. Clearly, the recent macro dynamics have done little to help us. This is nothing new. We have not and will not use them as excuses. Over the last few years, our teams have delivered exceptional, even record, performance while dealing with the global pandemic, severe constraints on raw materials and global logistics, record levels of cost inflation and now add to that list a rapid rise in interest rates. We know how to respond to external challenges by executing against that which we can control. Our Engineered Materials and Acetyl Chain teams each delivered record earnings across the first half of 2022. Their operational excellence and commercial agility has driven record adjusted earnings per share performance across the first half of 2022 and a very strong full year outlook, even without the benefit of share repurchases this year. Our finance team successfully secured permanent financing for the M&M acquisition in a very challenging market and are taking controllable actions to ensure the resiliency of our deleveraging plan. Our integration teams are rapidly synergizing Santoprene and making significant progress in M&M pre-integration work. We cannot predict what the world will present us with in the future. Right now, we see very little first-hand indications in our order book that warrants a severity of market headlines that we are all reading and the market response we have experienced. But I don't want to spend our time on this call today speculating on the things our team cannot control, whether that's business performance outside of Celanese or on certain macro ex conditions in the future. And while we do not expect the worst, I want to be clear that we will be positioned and prepared for it. We are eager to close the M&M acquisition, which we are targeting for the fourth quarter of this year. I've had the chance to meet many M&M employees over the last few months. I have been very impressed by their capability, their passion for the business and their excitement about the new company we are forming. They will be an important part of our success, and I'm excited to welcome them to Celanese. We are excited about the opportunity we will have as one team to drive growth and value creation in Engineered Materials going forward. Above all else, I am confident in the momentum Celanese is building to deliver long-term growth and value for shareholders.  With that, I'd like to ask Darrel to go ahead and open up the session for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question has come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Lori, just reading the prepared remarks, I may have misunderstood it, but it doesn't seem like you're assuming below plan EBITDA for M&M next year but just that you're going to have the higher interest expense. Is that correct? Or is it just that you think some of the work you can do can allow you to have cash flow that's on plan, in which case EBITDA kind of becomes less relevant? Or what is it that your latest thinking is on that right now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Vincent. Look, our real focus has been on -- really focusing on cash flow and steps that we can take to offset the additional pretax interest of about $250 million that we're anticipating. I'd have to say I'm really pleased with our team for having completed this financing in what's been a very difficult environment to do that. So we are really pleased with where we are on financing. But we have been looking at how do we offset that from a cash flow basis. And so we're looking at capital, we're looking at working capital. We're looking at other forms of generating cash. Obviously, our better performance within Celanese this year and our belief of that continuing through next year will also help in terms of really offsetting that on a cash performance. I think if we look at DuPont's M&M performance, I mean, we're seeing the same numbers you are so we don't have any insight into Q2. And I would say we are disappointed. But that said, we assume they've had some of the same headwinds we've had in inflation, currency, certainly Asia automotive, which they're exposed to and the volatility there. So we're going to be watching their performance. I have to say, personally, I'm more interested in what they do in the second half and the momentum that they can build as we move through the second half and towards the time of the acquisition. And obviously, we're very focused as we look at synergies and early synergy capture and looking at what steps similar to what we did with Santoprene, what steps can we take immediately upon closure of the acquisition to try to get their earnings up to the level that we expected at the time of the deal. Vincent Andrews : And just as a follow-up, could you just talk a little bit about sort of the differential in acetic acid pricing between Asia and the United States? It just seems to be at a pretty wide level. What was your expectation for sort of how that spread is going to play out? A \u2013 Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think what we saw in the second quarter is utilization, although it was pretty robust in Asia, we saw some demand come off due to COVID. All the producers were operating pretty well. So we did see demand softening as we moved \u2013 or sorry, price softening as we moved through the second quarter. As we look at the third quarter, we expect it to probably stay in that kind of $450 per ton that we\u2019re still seeing for China acid. I think the story in the Western Hemisphere is a little different. Demand has continued to be fairly strong, really everywhere in the Western Hemisphere. And we have had some producer outages in the Western Hemisphere continuing into now the third quarter. So I think that\u2019s where you see the price differential. And maybe what\u2019s a little different is \u2013 so with the logistics issues in the world today and availability of boats, I think it\u2019s been a little bit harder for people to move \u2013 some of our competitors, I would say, to move Asia, out of Asia and into other areas of the world, which has kept that differential high. And I expect that differential to continue as we move into third quarter. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Mike Leithead : First one, Lori, I was hoping you could expand upon, in the prepared remarks, you talked about a strategic overhaul of the Acetate Tow business. Just how you're thinking about potentially rethinking your commercial approach there? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. If we look at our performance of Acetate Tow, I mean, while historically, we were really focused on delivering our customers with kind of unparalleled quality and security of supply, both of which came with longer-term contracts, we've clearly seen in this period of rapid raw material price escalation and rapid escalation of energy pricing, that this method of using fixed contracts is really unsustainable. I mean, overall demand remains fairly robust in the industry, but we clearly cannot and will not continue to run a business that is losing money. So we would like to build in more optionality to that business. We need to become more nimble. We need to move towards more dynamic pricing. And so much like we did in past years with VAM and emulsions and RDP, we really want to relook at what are our commercial contracts, how do we source, how do we manufacture, all the logistics is everything, how do we produce or provide enhanced optionality versus what we have today. We're really confident there's value in doing so. Like we said, we have experience having done that with some of the downstream derivatives of acetic acid. And we think by running this business in a similar way, we'll be able to deliver much greater value in the years ahead. Mike Leithead : And then maybe second, just for Scott. I just want to clarify some of the interest expense comments you made in the prepared remarks. So if I just read it correctly, I believe you're adjusting the M&M interest out of adjusted EPS but that's still included in your free cash flow guidance. Is that correct? And just what is the incremental interest versus maybe what you thought last quarter pre-debt raise? Scott Richardson : Yes. So we are going to adjust ahead of close that out of EPS, Mike, so you're correct on that. But we have included it because we have not adjusted free cash flow. So it is included there as that cost of carry. And that cost of carry is still very similar to what we had originally baked into the deal. Even though interest costs have risen, the ability to reinvest that money ahead of close, now we're in a higher return than expected previously. So the net interest on the carry is basically about the same as what we had originally anticipated for the deal. So overall, interest cost, based on the financing right now on an annualized basis going forward, post close, we would expect to be in that $250 million per year range. And we are continuing to look for ways to bring that down, and we have some plans that we plan to implement in subsequent quarters. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : In your debt financing, do you have an ability to easily refinance the different portions of the debt if interest rates come down? Or you're more constrained? Scott Richardson : Yes. So Jeff, what we did on that financing is we did try to weight a good portion of that financing to the short end of the curve on the fixed debt. So we have a larger amount on the 2 and 3-year, which will allow us to either not just refinance but hopefully delever and pay that off with the cash flow in the early parts of the deal. We also have term loans which are variable in the amount of about $1.5 billion as well, which will give us the ability to refinance that earlier on. We're also looking at different cross-currency options on a go-forward basis. As we look to and get better understanding of where earnings are going to be in the next several years, we do have the ability to do some cross-currency swaps like we had previously done a few weeks ago to additional euro opportunities as well as yen opportunities to best match where the earnings exposure will be. Jeff Zekauskas : My second question. When you think about the Acetyl Chain in 2023, if we again go into a pronounced economic slowdown, we seem to be in a different place because oil prices are so much higher, whether they stay at where we are or whether they come down somewhat. When you think of the earnings level or the earnings power of the Acetyl Chain in a 2023 recession, where do you think we would be or what range? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think the question you're really asking, Jeff, is where do we see a level of foundational earnings? And although we may be in a recessionary environment next year, I think -- personally, I think it will be more shallow and the impact on our business, while we're not immune to it, we think is, at this point, manageable. So I think, if you look at the first half of this year and you look at the trailing 12 months, we've been at a $2 billion a year level for the Acetyl Chain. And clearly, that is not foundational. Clearly, we've seen some fairly exceptional conditions these last few years. So we do expect moderation. If you go back a year or so, we were guiding to about $1 billion a year prior to the lift from the Clear Lake expansion as our foundational earnings. And we've continued to improve our business over the last few years. We've built in a lot of additional optionality. We added Elotex and the RDP capability. We've continued to enhance our commercial agility in Acetyl Chain, and we have seen improved global supply-demand balances. And we see that even in China today where I mean, prices certainly have moderated, I'd say, back to more typical levels. But we're still at kind of 85% to 90% utilization in China. So overall, we feel very confident. We've lifted our foundational earnings above that $1 billion a year level. Clearly, like I said, in China, we're seeing the acetic acid moderation. I expect at some point, we'll start to see some of that in the Western Hemisphere as well, very -- some moderation in, for example, paints and coatings but still robust to historical. So I don't have an exact number at this point. What I would tell you is we continue to look at this and we'd like to kind of see how the third quarter develops. And as we typically do, we'll be coming out with some guidance for 2023 in the October time frame. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : Curious if you could talk about some of the end market volumes that you're seeing at EM, kind of as you went from the end of second quarter into 3Q. So like auto, consumer durables, where are you seeing more weakness and how pronounced that weakness is in that market versus your performance? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think if we look at EM, we are seeing slight softness, I'd say, across all regions. I mean, in Asia with the COVID lockdowns, we saw a little bit of softness there, although surprisingly, auto continued to be very strong for us in Asia, even though the market was down, I think, 13% in China in terms of builds, we were actually up about 8%. I would say in Asia, we need a little more visibility kind of post the COVID recovery here now to really assess the fundamental demand that's going to exist for some of the other areas. I'd say in the U.S., we're seeing consumer spending stay up, really holding up the best of all of the regions, which is supporting certainly auto build but also industrial demand and some of the electronics and electricity. And then in the EU, I'd say we're seeing some signs that inflation and energy uncertainty is starting to impact demand but fairly weak signals this point. If you look at the different end markets, in auto, what I would say is right now, it's pretty hard for us to imagine a scenario where demand is what's going to drive auto. We really think it's going to continue to be driven by availability of raw materials, specifically chips. And our outlook is chip availability gets slightly better every quarter and will continue to do so through the end of '23. And we believe that's what will -- we believe demand is pretty robust. We're seeing that in all segments of the world, big backlogs, low inventories. So auto, we think, is just really being driven by chip availability, and that's true in all sectors. I think maybe the thing to think about in auto though is new autos today use a lot more chips, especially EVs. And so although more chips are becoming available as they are prioritized to more premium autos and to EVs, that probably still translates to less auto builds than maybe traditionally would have been seen from that. I think the real softness we've seen has been more in appliances and consumer electronics, maybe not surprising because everybody seems to have bought a new computer and a new phone during COVID, and I think there's not a pent-up demand there. So I would characterize it though as modest softness, just a few percent. Could also be the impact of inflation. Medical, I would say, actually, our medical business as a total is back at pre-COVID levels in terms of level of earnings. And that is even without implants being back at their pre-COVID levels. So we're seeing much stronger demand in medical for other elements of our medical portfolio like long-dosage delivery devices and that sort of thing. And then you asked about EM but I would just say on the acetyl side, the softness we're seeing is more in paints and coatings and construction. But I would say that's off a historical high versus necessarily of what we would consider a typical level of demand. Josh Spector : And just in terms of EM earnings, I think some of your competitors have been a bit more vocal about the FX impact and how that changed their outlook. Did anything change from your perspective versus your planning basis? Obviously, rates are worse but I'm not sure what was embedded in your guidance. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I mean, certainly, we're seeing the FX impact in Engineered Materials. If you look at, say, this -- second quarter of this year versus last year, it's about $10 million just for EM. So we're certainly seeing it. It was a little higher this quarter than we had originally planned but I think only to the tune of a couple of million for EM. And look, I think this is really where you see the strength of our pipeline model in Engineered Materials as well as really the commercial agility of our EM employees. I mean, they have been out there managing product mix, managing pricing, doing all those things to really cover the cost of raw materials and cover the ForEx headwinds that we've been seeing throughout this quarter and all the quarters in front of it and all the quarters to come. And I think that's where you really see the strength of Celanese and the people at Celanese. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess for my first question, on your comments, Lori, in your prepared comments about inventory levels having sort of normalized in many end markets, verticals along the supply chain, does that, by definition, create less opportunities for the AC segment in terms of just sort of flexing the chain and maximizing molecular profitability? Or is that not the case? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I would characterize it, Ghansham -- I think our focus in the Acetyl Chain have done a tremendous job really flexing the chain over the last, call it, 2 years to really respond to the difference in Western Hemisphere economics versus China and to really move as much down the chain as we can. What I would say is as we see soft China pricing, you saw last quarter, we moved a lot of material out of Asia into Europe and we did that in the first quarter as well. We'll continue to do that. What I would say is though we're probably reaching our limits of how much more flexibility we have in the changes because we're really full in downstream derivatives. We're running full capacity in VAM, VAE, RDP. So we'll continue to take commercial actions to try to take advantage of other opportunities we see in the market. But I think we've really been pushing the boundaries of the optionality we have within the AC chain, if you really -- especially if you look at second quarter. Ghansham Panjabi : And then on the recession sort of scenario, how do you see volumes playing out for your EM segment in context of the fact that many end markets such as autos, which are quite large, number fully recovered? And would you expect also the same for M&M? I understand you don't own it yet and so on, but just given the nature of the end market matrix for that business as well. Lori Ryerkerk : My view on auto, and I just talked about it a little bit, my view on auto is we probably have 3 years pent-up demand in auto. I mean, if you order a car in Europe, you wait a year to get it. If you order one in Japan, you wait 1 to 2 years. Even in the U.S., I mean, you can wait quite a long time if you're looking for something specific. So I think there's a lot of pent-up demand in auto. And especially for premium vehicles, which we have a stronger presence in and EVs, which we have a stronger presence in. While in a recessionary environment, you would normally expect that, given we have been so long now and have this large pent-up demand, I think auto is going to be relatively unaffected. Again, I don't see anything through the end of 2023 that's going to impact auto demand other than the shortage of chips and other raw materials, but primarily chips. I think we will continue to see softness if we go into a more recessionary environment on consumer durables, things that people can put off buying, consumer electronics. People will wait to buy their next iPhone. But medical and pharma is a very resilient market. I don't expect to see any impact there. And we're not seeing any impact in industrial and some of the electronics into 5G and things like that. And I really expect those buildouts for 5G and that sort of thing to continue. For power generation, I mean, with the way the world is moving, more electric vehicles, more infrastructure, more Internet of Things, I don't really see those being impacted. So the real impact I expect is what we're starting to see the softening in, which is consumer durables and consumer electronics, which for us, is a fairly small part of our portfolio. Again, I don't own M&M but we do know that the vast majority -- the kind of 50% of their materials roughly goes into auto. So I would expect that to continue to be a pretty robust market as we go forward even in a recessionary environment as well. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice quarter and outlook. Lori, I guess with the added financing, and I know you guys do a really good job of offsetting a lot of negatives though, I think you hope the deal would be accretive by a couple of dollars in the first year. Is that -- I mean, it seems like hard to do but is it still going to be accretive? And are there things for you to do to offset the EPS dilution of the deal -- or of the financing? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, Mike, I would just say it's too early for me to give you a definitive answer on that. I mean, we are really -- we think -- as I said, right now, we've been focused on the cash side of that equation, really maximizing cash flow. We do see we have meaningful opportunities also in the size and timing of our synergies. We think as we've done with Santoprene, we'll be able to pull things forward and increase the amount of synergies we can in the first year. As I said on the cash side, working capital, capital expenditures. Also, the performance of our businesses, we need to get a better view on 2023, which we're working through right now. So I would say from an accretion standpoint, it's just too early to call. But again, I would expect we should have a revised update we can share with all of you in the October time frame. Michael Sison : And then it sounds -- you noted in the prepared remarks that the disappointment in M&M results so far. When you sort of -- I know you don't have the business yet, but when you think about how the business has performed, do you sort of see it as more external and the end markets are more difficult? Or is it maybe some ways they operate that you can immediately improve and the results maybe should have been better? Lori Ryerkerk : That's a tough question to answer, Mike. Look, we -- within Celanese, we expect our business to be world-class operators. We expect them to be commercially agile. We sell our products into highly differentiated and specified end applications. So we work very hard in Celanese to really preserve profitability despite external disruptions and through periods of volatility. As we kind of say, you'll never hear someone in Celanese use the excuse for underperformance by saying that the market is cyclical or that we had too many headwinds. I think that's how we operate in Celanese. Now we know there's a lot of great people coming from M&M. But I think we know the value of our models and we know the value of our culture, and we believe we'll be able to apply that all to M&M and get differentiated performance from that asset as well. So that's really our focus as we work through integration and move towards the close. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. P.J. Juvekar : Quick question on your natural gas exposure in Europe. You gave some details about Germany and your Trash-2-Cash deal. But if the supply's severely curtailed in the winter, is it possible that maybe you can shut down your Frankfurt plant and supply that -- supply those customers from either Europe or Asia? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, as we said in our notes, our natural gas exposure in Europe is focused in Frankfurt, Germany. And I would say 30% of our global sales come out of Germany in 2021 and that's pretty typical normally. And because of Trash-2-Cash, we also have projects that we can use fuel oil in IPH. I think it's not -- it is highly unlikely we would want to or would need to shut down IPH in the winter. Obviously, on acetyls, we have the option to bring materials from Asia or from Europe, but we don't produce a lot of that there. It's really just palm production is the main thing we make as well as some other things in IPH. So I don't think it's highly likely we will need to. We may run at reduced rates, I think, is the more likely thing. And again, is the big energy consumer there. A lot of the other things we produce there don't use nearly the amount of energy. So -- and I think there are other places in Europe outside of Germany that may be more impacted, although we are working to look at the plants to mitigate at all of our critical locations in Europe. Scott Richardson : Yes. Flexing capacity is something we do every day, P.J. We've talked a lot about it in Acetyl business but we do it in Engineered Materials as well. And so if there is opportunities where we have excess capacity that is lower cost in other regions, we can move that around if the logistics are there, as Lori mentioned, and we will always look to maximize profitability if that opportunity exists. P.J. Juvekar : Great. And then in automotive, many chemical companies and others saw that there is a quick snapback. But as you rightly said, there are constraints on the chip side and all that. So what's the more realistic outlook? Can you talk about maybe like a global bill number that is more reasonable? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, look, you may recall when we went into this year, we actually, despite IHS having a fairly optimistic number, I don't remember what it was, 8% or maybe even higher than that, of build growth from '21 to '22, we actually based our '22 forecast on flat auto builds from '21 to '22. And I think if you look at where we are, I think we're just under 2% growth now according to IHS for global auto builds. And although they're still calling out 4%, we still think flat was a pretty good prediction. And again, because we really based it on chip recovery and the fact that vehicles use more chips now, so you need more recovery in chips in order to fill the same number of vehicles. So we still think flat versus '21 is a pretty good estimate. Maybe a few percent of growth here in the second half as we see chips becoming more and more available. But I think flat. The interesting thing is here in North America, you would think with energy prices that we'd start to see the transition to more demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. But in fact, we're not. We're still seeing plenty of trucks and SUVs being the primary models being built. And again, these tend to be higher and more premium vehicles and require a lot of chips. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Scott, I was wondering if you could address your latest thoughts on the capital budget. Last quarter, I think you indicated $550 million, but in reading the prepared remarks last night, it sounds like you're actively evaluating options to reduce that number. What kind of levers could you pull if necessary? And do you have any early thoughts on how that number could trend in '23 as you complete your expansion at Clear Lake? Scott Richardson : Yes. So I think that $550 million range for this year is still likely where we'll be. As we look forward next year, I mean, we -- in our original modeling with the combined enterprise with M&M, we had -- we've baked in a higher amount of capital than we would likely need. And as we continue to understand that business better, I think there's going to be additional opportunities to bring that capital number down. So we'll provide a little more color on where we think that's going to be on a combined basis as we get into October. But it likely is going to be one of those important elements to offset that incremental $250 million of interest that we talked about in the prepared remarks. So I think we won't be able to offset it all through capital versus our original plan, but we'll certainly be able to get a good chunk of it from capital. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then, Lori -- Lori Ryerkerk : If I could add to that, I mean, because you did ask where might it come from. I think like we saw this year, given the large number of assets that we are getting from DuPont, we will be evaluating where do we think we'll be able to get more capacity more efficiently out of the DuPont assets versus new build. And so we'll be evaluating that, and we do think there are some synergy opportunities there. And then I think like you saw us do during COVID, with higher material pricing right now for steel and everything else, although we start to see it coming down, with trying to get a clearer view of demand in 2023, we think there's going to be some opportunity to delay some of the larger capital projects and use that time, like we did with Clear Lake, to get some efficiencies and savings in terms of construction costs and how we actually contract for the construction of those facilities. So I'd say it's nothing dramatic. We're not cutting to the bone. We still think use of capital for organic growth is a really good use of cash. But we are going to be cautious with how we invest in light of the uncertainty around the economics for next year. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. And then Lori, in reading your remarks, it sounds like you're comfortable enough with the order books as you see them here in July anyway. But in a scenario where the macro environment continued to move again, so to speak, how do you think about portfolio composition? In other words, do you see any levers that you could pull in terms of noncore assets that may be useful to accelerate the process of deleveraging, if necessary? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, it's something we look at all the time. We're always reviewing our portfolio. And as you've seen, we've made a number of moves over the last several years, whether it's an opportunistic move like the PPC divestiture that we did or some of the smaller divestitures we did around PPE and some other composites. So what I would say is, first, we have sufficient financing capacity on our balance sheet today to finance the deal with cash and committed debt. So we don't need to sell anything in the near term. And although -- that said, we will be opportunistic. We -- interestingly enough, we have actually had a reasonable large amount of inbound calls about some of our assets versus what we've typically seen in the last few years. So although the equity market has slowed down, we are getting a lot of calls. And that has given us the opportunity to look at a variety of our assets and really see if there's some opportunistic ability to monetize any of those, again similar to what we did for Polyplastics. So it's something we're looking at but not something we have to do. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : You called out the performance of Santoprene in the quarter. How did POM do? You've got a key competitor that's orphaned right now. I would think this is a pretty good environment for you to gain some share in POM. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I'd say in POM, I think POM is performing as we had it for the year, expected it to perform. It continues to go into a lot of high value end applications. And I wouldn't say we see any real difference in demand or margins on POM now versus what we expected. John Roberts : And then how did Ibn Sina do in the quarter? I would think this was a really good environment for them. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So obviously, with higher methanol prices last quarter, we saw that roll through in Ibn Sina. I think we called that out in our comments. We had a good bump up from Ibn Sina but mostly offset, all but about $5 million, offset by the KEPCO restructuring. And so it's done well. Again, remember, Ibn Sina is on a 1-quarter lag so we should continue to see help from Ibn Sina as we move into the third quarter as well. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : A question around the trajectory of volumes within the Acetyl Chain. I take a look at the sequential uptick in volumes from Q4 to Q1, and it was 8%, even though if I remember correctly, there were a couple of turnarounds in Q1. And then I take a look at the sequential sort of downtick. In Q2, it was a 3% downtick. So I'm just trying to get a better sense of that trajectory from Q4 to Q1 to Q2, obviously keeping in mind the Europe situation, which is obviously prevalent in the first quarter as well. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, the Q1 to Q2 is fairly straightforward. I mean, we did -- while we did have some small turnarounds in Q1 at Clear Lake, we had some larger impacts in Q2, which then we had to declare force majeure because of raw material -- outages at some of our raw material suppliers for Clear Lake. So that really -- that difference in volume, you see Q1 to Q2 is really caused by that force majeure event in Clear Lake. Hassan Ahmed : And now just on the strategic overhaul that you guys talked about within Acetate Tow. I mean, would a potential sale be considered? Obviously, have memories of you guys sort of working down that part earlier, but that was obviously a very different time as well. But would that be something that you guys would think about as well? And maybe potentially some of these inbound calls, are they related to the AT business as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, what I'd say is when we've talked about it on these calls before, we would certainly consider a sale but we think we would come up against the same problems with anti-competition in Europe that we had previously on the deal that was contemplated. So I'd say we're really focused at this point on actions that we can take that are under our own control to improve the performance of that business. Scott Richardson : Yes. And Hassan, just to add to that, it's -- we've had a lot of value that's been created by operating Acetyl Chain as an integrated value chain and ensuring that in the downstream derivatives, the full value of the upstream is captured and contained in how we price the products. And so we believe there's a lot more overall enterprise value to be created by operating that business more integrated on a go-forward basis. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Lori and Scott, back to M&M. What have you learned over the last few months in your integration work that makes you more positive about the combination? Anything you've learned that may be not as hopeful as you would have thought initially? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. A couple of things. One, I have to say, having gotten to meet a good number of people now in the M&M organization, I am very positive about the people who will be joining the company, their passion for the business, and frankly, their excitement about joining Celanese and this opportunity we have to really make this world leader in Engineered Materials company by putting our assets together. And so I think with any large M&A, you always have to worry about the cultural integration. And I would say what we see is for the folks who work in M&M, we think they're actually much closer to us in terms of culture than we probably thought before. Obviously, there's things we need to look out for and all that. But we're actually pretty -- we're very excited about the folks that we're getting and how they're going to -- how we can come together to really take the best of both companies and really have an outstanding Engineered Materials business. I would say also, as we continue to dig into synergies, and Scott may want to try to comment more, but as we dig into synergies, the synergies that we had called out are real. They're there. We think we'll be able to probably get more, and we think we'll probably be able to get them faster. So we're working through all those steps now. And so therefore, we think there is even more value to be had. And I think some of the things that the premises we had around how we can continue to commercially build that business, take advantage of the pipeline model and those things, I think we, again, feel very positive about the value that can be generated with those molecules and using the pipeline model that we have used so effectively here in Celanese. Scott Richardson : Yes. Just on that synergy point, I think we had originally baked in $150 million in the first year and $150 million in the second year of cost to achieve synergies. We think we're actually going to be able to spend less than that in year 1 especially and still get at or above the original synergy target of $75 million in that first year. So there's a lot more lower-cost synergies or no cost synergies early on as we model that out, which we're excited about. And then 1 other thing to add is just the commercial teams. I think what we've learned is how we're structured, how M&M is structured, very similar in terms of how to approach customers, yet kind of maybe the governance of how we do it and they do it is very complementary. So there's some things that we believe are going to be things that enhance and evolve our model. And we've talked now for 5, 6 years about the continual evolution of our pipeline model and we think bringing M&M in is going to be a nice accelerator in that evolution, which should create some market opportunities going forward. David Begleiter : And just quickly, Acetate Tow, what's been the reaction from your customers to this new strategy or is it too early to get full feedback yet? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think it's too early. I mean, we're still working internally to develop our models and how exactly that works. So we'll see more, I guess, in the second half as we go out with some changes to our customers. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : So just in general, seeing a pretty significant number of acetyl outages over the last 24 months, not just Celanese, kind of industry-wide and at a frequency we're not used to seeing. So what's the issue here? I mean, is this like everybody took ownership of their CO units and it's become a problem? Are they underinvested in? How -- why does everybody keep going down? Lori Ryerkerk : It's an interesting question and I have to see the data because I'm not -- if I'm looking, thinking on my own memory, I'd actually say within Celanese, our acetyl units are running probably more reliably than they have in their history. So I'd have to see, look at the industry numbers to see if that's really accurate. I don't think there's any common themes here. I mean, I do think coming out of COVID, we saw people running facilities very hard because there was that sudden uptick in demand. And so I think turnarounds are pushed off and those sorts of things, and you're seeing people either having to take those turnarounds or maybe having pushed a bit too long and having unplanned downtime. But I -- there's nothing other kind of systematic kind of failure in the system that I see that would support that there's an issue. I think it may just be timing and maybe just recently bias in terms of always thinking things are worse today than they were in the past. Scott Richardson : The 1 thing I would add though, Matthew, I think it's important, we brought this up on other calls is we are starting to see with some of the logistical challenges, we're seeing more Western Hemisphere downstream demand come back online and the demand is higher. And yet it's harder to get product out of Asia, particularly China, into the Western Hemisphere. And I think we've talked now for a number of years about the need for capacity in Asia to flow to the Western Hemisphere to keep things balanced. And that's been really challenged in this period of time. And so I think without that coming over into the West, that has kind of made some of these outages more visible in the market than maybe what they had been historically. Matthew DeYoe : That's a fair point, yes. And then how much revenue did KEPCO, [switch] and Santoprene add to EM in the second quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : So versus second quarter last year, Santoprene, about $15 million versus last year when we didn't have Santoprene. Scott Richardson : And KEPCO was pretty minimal. It's pretty immaterial. It's not far off from that Santoprene number, but it was pretty minimal. Matthew DeYoe : And then -- if I -- is KEPCO, was that like it's a full quarter or was there a partial quarter there? Scott Richardson : It's a partial quarter because there's still inventory that needed to be sold out of the JV so it was pretty small in the quarter. Lori Ryerkerk : But remember, then it actually came out of equity earnings as well, so it's kind of netted out in the total bottle line. Matthew DeYoe : Sure. I was just trying to get a clear read on volumes for EM on the quarter. Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Matthew Blair : With all the volatility in oil, nat gas and coal, has the cost curve changed for acetyls? And do you have a sense on operating rates by region? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I don't think the cost curve has really switched. I mean, the only place I would say you really see kind of things really out of whack, I mean, things have tended to move in parity, but the thing that's really out of whack, of course, is natural gas in Europe. Compared to oil, if you look at natural gas prices today with the cutback in the Nord Stream and everything, I mean, it's probably the equivalent of $350 oil. Now again, not a big factor for us on acetyls but bigger factor for Engineered Materials. So I would say for acetyls, the cost curve continues to be, even at these higher natural gas prices in the U.S., still a significant advantage in U.S. Gulf Coast, acetyl production and then oil in Singapore and coal in China remain about the same. And then again, Europe is a little bit upside down but that's not a big factor for us on acetyls. Scott Richardson : Yes. I think it's also important to think about landed cost curve because ultimately that's what really matters. And because of that logistical dynamic that I talked about a few minutes ago, I mean, that certainly is holding things up because it's really expensive to move product right now, even if you can get the boats out of China into Europe or the U.S. Matthew Blair : And then, Lori, I think you mentioned the currency headwind of about $10 million in the second quarter. Do you have a similar number for 2022 that's embedded in your guidance? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So the $10 million was just for EM. If you actually look at quarter-to-quarter, currency was almost $25 million just from Q1 '22 to second quarter '22. So we do have a number embedded in the full year guidance. I'm not sure what it is right off the top of my head, but Scott, you may have it? Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean, just from a general role of thumb, about a $0.01 change in the euro is call it about $7 million of earnings per quarter. So it's sizable on an annualized basis. And as Lori talked about earlier in the call, the teams both in Engineered Materials and Acetyls have done a phenomenal job of offsetting that. So it's sizable and it's been a pretty significant impact on us for the full year. We've effectively baked in very similar euro rates to what we're seeing today into our back half guidance. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess first off, you went through some nice commentary in your prepared remarks on natural gas in Europe, and you just kind of addressed that a little bit as well as being somewhat out of whack. But I guess, given some of those actions you have taken, it does appear that you're expecting this level of pricing to remain on a structurally higher basis into the foreseeable future. Is that the case? And I guess, if so, how do we think about EM and the impact from these higher costs in the next couple of years? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think the energy surcharge that was put in place by the Engineered Materials group has been very effective in helping us maintain margins. And our customers understand it and aren't necessarily happy but have been willing to pay it, and we haven't seen any major impact on volume because of the higher price. Now as we move forward and if we continue to stay at this kind of $60 per million Btu we're seeing today as we move into the winter period, I do think we will see energy pricing, not necessarily the pass-through on our materials, but just energy pricing for producers of goods in Europe being negatively impacted by energy, whether it be price or even availability at a certain point in time. And I think that's more likely that price at their own facilities is more likely to lead to demand destruction for EM than necessarily the energy cost pass-through that we're putting on our product. Arun Viswanathan : And then as a follow-up, similarly, you noted there is a CapEx reduction here and potentially even greater in '23. Could you just describe that a little bit more? And I guess, you said you'd get to the 3x leverage in a couple of years. I'm just wondering if you have greater levers to reduce CapEx by even more to stay on track with that deleveraging or if it's not really dependent on that. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, we could cut our CapEx in half if we needed to. We've done it before. We did it when COVID happened. We're not going to cut it so far that we can't maintain and run our facilities in a safe and reliable way. I also don't think it's going to be necessary to do that in order to meet the financial objectives that we've set out around this deal. But we always have those levers to further delay projects or cancel projects. But again, we're really looking at what is the long-term health of this business, and there's a lot of -- in Engineered Materials, there's a lot of expansions we want to do and polymers that aren't coming over from DuPont, just our base polymers. Just like in Acetyls, we want to continue our expansions in VAE and VAM. Of course, we're going to finish the Clear Lake product -- project. So there are additional levers if we were to need them, if we were to get into a significant recession, which we're not really seeing the signs of now and significant demand destruction. Obviously, there are more levers we can pull. But the kind of levels we're talking about now, $50 million this year, maybe $50 million to $100 million next year, these kind of levels are things that we think it makes sense to do just in light of the deal and the opportunity we may have to more efficiently produce from the DuPont assets and in light of current high prices for contractors, for steel and for all of those other things, just slight delay in a bit. Scott Richardson : Yes. Just to provide a little more color for you, Arun. We had baked in $800 million of combined capital in 2023 for our base business plus M&M. And just given some of the dynamics that Lori talked about, we don't see needing to spend nearly that level. So we know we're going to be able to get a chunk of that back in cash to be able to offset some of the higher interest expense we talked about. Brandon Ayache : Darrel, make the next question our last one, please. Operator : Our final questions come from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Kiesean Riddick : This is Kiesean on for Steve. So I'm looking at Engineering Materials, it's undergone quite an impressive transformation. So I was just wondering if you could touch a little bit more on what drove your EM results, especially in China in terms of your EV exposure. And where do you see that going through year-end? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. As I said earlier, we actually saw very high demand in China despite a slowdown -- a significant slowdown in auto build because of the issues with COVID. I think there's a couple of things was; one, it's our great folks in China who are out there. We also tend to -- and really continuing to push the commercial models and new volume, which comes from the project pipeline. It's also the fact that we tend to go in premium vehicles, which tend to be prioritized over other vehicles. And then certainly, EVs in China where we have a very large presence. EVs continue to be prioritized by the automakers, and we continue to see a lot of material going into the EV market, especially for GUR into lithium-ion battery separator films. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Brandon Ayache for any closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. We'd like to thank everybody for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call for any follow-up questions. Darrel, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Darrel. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments about the quarter on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of the press release as well as the prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Because we've published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll go ahead and open the line directly for your questions. Darrel, please go ahead and open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Josh Spector : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, now that you've owned the M&M asset for a few days here, wondering if you can give us some context on the performance this year from an EBITDA perspective, also maybe some historical context given DuPont embedded on corporate and if not the full segment, how has that performed. And then also when you look at next year, you gave the comments of $800 million to get to that business pre-synergies, what are the major lifts that it takes to get there from the current run rate? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks for the question, Josh. That's actually a lot of questions, so let me see if I can navigate all that. So on third quarter performance, I mean, DuPont will be reporting shortly. Obviously, what they report is not apples-to-apples necessarily because it does include Delrin as well. But I think it's fair to say, in third quarter, much like the first two quarters, M&M is not performing in line with our expectations of the business or even in line with how they performed in 2021, and I think you saw that in the numbers we called out for fourth quarter. And I think if you think about fourth quarter, I mean, fourth quarter is typically a low quarter for us as well. We do get seasonality in the fourth quarter. We expect to DuPont to see the same seasonality. I think we see some of the concerns we've had on DuPont's performance continuing with the M&M asset in the fourth quarter as well. So, it's - again, it's only been three days. But I would say, as we've gotten to get a clear view of M&M's performance, I think there's a couple of reasons we see for their underperformance this year. So overall, poor demand backdrop in Asia and Europe. It may not dissimilar I think in Europe from what we've seen but I think we've had a little bit more upside in Asia on auto than they have seen. Competitive dynamics that is really impacting more of the standard business, of which we believe they've had a bit more than versus the differentiated business. And I would say also, insufficient commercial flexibility to really pivot and respond to the market and the need to do different things in the market, maybe as quickly as we have. I think also, their current contract for sourcing for nylon has been a bit challenging in this economic environment. And I think it boils down to there's really been a margin compression that's occurred, especially in the nylon area, and surprisingly, in some cases, they - it's not that they haven't raised prices, actually the fact that they didn't adjust price downward, stay competitive, and they've lost volume. They've also had some pretty significant foreign currency headwinds, which are different than we've experienced due to the fact that, they're a bit more exposed than we are with the way they write their contracts. So if we think about moving forward now into the rest of the fourth quarter that we've closed and moving into next year, I'll talk a little bit about how we'll address each of these. So on the foreign currency headwinds, that's an impact of almost over $20 million for us alone in November and December on the M&M assets. And so I think we really - we're looking at how do we optimize our commercial practices to address the sales currency exposures, so what's denominated in local currency and what's in U.S. dollars. We also can use some of our debt to look at converting more of our U.S. dollar debt to lower rate currencies, like the euro or the yuan or the yen, which will help us lower our borrowing rates that will help the overall financial condition of the Company. I think when we look at key raw materials and the purchasing requirement, we will be able to exercise some of the flexibility we have within Celanese to really utilize some of M&M polymer capacity. So if you think about it, M&M has a fairly large take-or-pay contract currently for raw materials for nylon. And so they've been producing a lot of materials, but they've been building inventory. We can actually start buying that - using that inventory, using that excess production for Celanese, which will be, net-net, better for both companies together. I think also remember we called out at the time of the deal, there is actually the contract for raws has been renegotiated and a new contract will come in place at the 1st of 2023. This new contract has less take-or-pay requirement, so that will give us more flexibility and optionality going forward. So let us - I think about it as, it really let us start - one element of starting to run this larger nylon portfolio in a more integrated, flexible, commercially agile way much like the transition we went through with POM a few years ago, much like the transition we went through with Acetyls some year before that. On the volume side, I think we have a lot of opportunities between M&M and the heritage Celanese assets to really deploy our combined commercial team to cross-sell, not just nylon, but other products including other Celanese products. So as we've gotten to really look at where all of our products are going, there's only about a 20% overlap in terms of the companies that are buying from us. So that was a really large space for us to go into the companies that each other has been in and really start cross-selling the entire portfolio versus just what we had traditionally. Pricing, again margin compression there. We actually think there's some opportunity in pricing to do it in a more differentiated way. So if you really look, our analysis so far is M&M took a fairly common response on pricing to everything, whereas we like to look at it in a couple different tranches. So for really differentiated products, we will always push pricing because we have the opportunity to do that. For more standard grade products, there may be places where you, in fact, have to reduce pricing in the current environment in order to maintain the same volume. And I think for us - and then cross-selling is another opportunity, but I think for us, it's really, instead of having one rule about we want to maximize margin percent or we want to maximize revenue or maximize volume, for us, it is always looking at value. How do we maximize the margin dollars being achieved from the products that we have out there? And then finally - and I know this is one answer, finally on inventory, M&M has built a pretty large excess of finished goods in inventory over 2022, as they seen some drop-off in market share and as they've continued to produce because of their raw material contract, that is burdening our November and December EBITDA as we start trying to take measures to get that inventory more in line. But longer-term, it will allow us to manage our inventory levels, again, more like POM, so that our pricing and our cost becomes more contemporary with each other, so we don't see as much kind of disconnect between cost and pricing as we go forward. So again, we'll take these actions. Now, we've already started all of that. But it will take some time, I'd say, to get the business performing to our expectations. So if we look at next year, if we look at, I'd say, $800 million of EBITDA that we aspire to for next year and that we're really pushing the team to achieve on the M&M assets, I mean, it is a big lift. I mean, it's coming from about what we think is going to be around $500 million this year for the M&M assets in EBITDA to $800 million that looks really big. I would remind you, though, that with the Celanese EM portfolio, we went from $571 million last year in 2021 to $800 million this year. So it's not that much bigger than we've already demonstrated that we know how to do and we already have a lot of actions underway and how we're going to do that. We're going to be helped by 4% higher auto builds next year. I think that's pretty consistently called out by everyone. And we've already been pre-qualifying the M&M nylon into our applications, our heritage Celanese applications, so we have a great start on that. Tom has already been meeting with all of the business teams in M&M to really do the deep dive, so we really can understand the nature of underperformance, what the opportunities are for next year. So I'd say, we're off to a very strong start. Yes, $800 million is a lift, but again not unachievable given our demonstrated performance in our own portfolio. Josh Spector : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions. David Begleiter : Thank you. Lori, Q4 EPS is annualizing at roughly $7 per share. Could you and Scott help us bridge us to the $14 upper-end of the range for next year. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I mean, I don't think you can look at Q4 and multiply that times four and get to a number for next year in terms of EBIT. Q4, we are seeing a lot of headwinds, a lot of challenges in Q4, again, because of the really slump we've seen in China with paintings, coatings, and constructions, with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns, the situation in Europe where we've also seen the drop there. The U.S. has held up pretty well. But I think in some of the destocking that we've seen, especially in acetyls, and the fact that acetyls is basically bumping and bouncing around its cost curve. These are conditions that we don't believe can last forever. So while we think first quarter may be challenging, we do see line of sight would be somewhat better than fourth quarter, again, because we have a lot of things coming in with M&M that we're having to manage in the fourth quarter. But I think, by first quarter, we start to see realization of some of the synergies, we'll have had a chance to start making some of the moves I just talked about. And then we really do expect the second half of the year to be back around in that $13 to $14 range. And again, a big portion of that is a lift I just described on M&M, but we have continued growth in our own Engineered Materials business in addition to the 4% higher auto builds we will see a GUR lift next year. GUR sold-out for EVs, lithium-ion battery separator films. That demand is only going up. So that will allow us to raise margins in GUR next year. LCP margins are also going up next year as we see high demand into 5G applications. Next year, we'll get the full benefit from Santoprene and KEPCO. And Santoprene, we do expect it to be back to the levels we had called out at the time of the deal in terms of returns on Santoprene. And then medical, which we saw this quarter return to pre-COVID levels, we are predicting continued growth in medical both in terms of orthopedics, but also in terms of the other applications, like vital dose and medical devices. So we see a lot of growth opportunities next year in the M&M portfolio, in our heritage Celanese portfolio, and we do see strengthening across - the opportunities strengthen across the Acetyl Chain as we move on through the year. I would also say, we will have a good uplift next year in our total earnings. As we talked about last quarter, we have been doing a lot to really restructure our Acetate Tow business as we are starting to run it more like we do a derivative of the Acetyl Chain. And much like we saw when we started doing that with VAM and emulsions, that allows us to build-in more optionality and more flexibility, which we'll look to increase our earnings. Historically, we've run that Tow business, really focused on customer value, quality, and reliability of supply. When China went independent, that reliability of supply became less important to our customers because there was an overhang in other regions. Now, that has tightened up again. We're at kind of 90% utilization in Tow outside of China. And so that, with the raw material and the energy volatility, has given us an opportunity now to really go in, put in new contract structures that allow us to better accommodate changes in raw material and energy pricing, really enhance the business models in Tow, take some costs out of Tow by integrating it into the acetic acid team and - while still maintaining that reliability of supply and that strong customer focus that we've had. So the result is, we will be seeing a much improved profitability in 2023 along with greatly improved flexibility. David Begleiter : And do you have a forecast for Tow next year, an early look at the improved profitability? Lori Ryerkerk : No, what I would say is, if you look at what we called out for Tow in 2023 in the Investor Day, we will be at or above that. David Begleiter : Very good. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your questions. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, first off, Lori, just in your prepared comments, you were talking about inventory destocking. And is it as simple as we just went from a world of just too little to too much very quickly and so that's what's exaggerating some of the weakness that you're seeing? And then related to that, can you just give us a timeline into your visibility that this will last through the first quarter, if not longer? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, I - Ghansham, thanks for the question. I think you have it exactly right. I mean, I think we went from everybody being worried about not being able to get molecules and kind of buying whatever they could get their hands on to all of a sudden all the production issues were resolved, demand started going down and people realize there was availability and they have hype across inventory and tankage, they want to bring that down before the end of the year and they assume that the molecules will be there. Just like when we see prices rising, people start buying because they think it will be more expensive tomorrow. Right now, they see prices falling, so they quit buying because they think it will be cheaper tomorrow. But I think a few things behind why we've gotten into this. I mean, we are seeing improved logistics. We are seeing improvement in port congestion and the ability to move materials around the globe. We are seeing improved product availability. There has been less outages and disruptions in the last quarter than we've been having over the previous few years. We are seeing a weaker demand outlook both again because of paints and coatings, which I talked about specifically in Europe and China, but also just some seasonality that we see in this area. And again, falling prices I think is a big effect on people's mental view of what they think. So I do think this is likely to extend into first quarter '23. Typically, when we see that flip is as we get through Chinese New Year is then we'd start to see demand coming up again and we'd start to see activities coming up again. And then as you get warming in the Western Hemisphere, you'd start to see it coming out. So that's why I feel pretty confident saying we expect to see the start to turn the other direction sometime after the first quarter. Scott Richardson : Yes, the one area where we don't see a lot of excess inventory, Ghansham, is in automotive and I think that's an area we're focused very closely on. We don't have that value chain that's full, so we're not seeing big destocking. We're seeing some level of seasonality here in the fourth quarter that's more like normal. But we do expect the fact that auto has been at relatively low levels from a build standpoint the last two years, that to kind of hold flat or slightly increase as we work our way into next year. So that's an area that we feel good about that we're not going to see major weakness as we work our way into the first half of next year. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay, thanks for that. And then maybe for you, Scott, on the one-plus-billion of discretionary free cash flow that you've targeted for 2023, what are the levers you can pull to deliver on that number in the scenario that the weakness you're anticipating through 1Q pushes a bit longer to the middle of the year? Thanks. Scott Richardson : Yes, I think, as we've scenario planned that out, Ghansham, we feel very confident in our ability to get to that level under a variety of different outcomes that could be there. And a lot of that is - the working capital build that we've had over the last 18 months has been fairly sizable. We've seen a similar build in the M&M business. And therefore, if we were to see a deeper decline in the first half of next year, there will likely be a much heavier collection of that working capital. So we feel very strong about that We continue to analyze. I think we've talked on these calls in the past about quarterly review of capital and looking at what our businesses need both in the near-term and long-term to better match that capital spend. We've brought that capital down on a combined basis already, expecting around $600 million of capital next year. We lowered the capital this year down to $550 million. And so those are levers that we'll continue to evaluate, depending on where the demand landscape is. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. You gave an idea of acetic acid prices in China as being close to $400 a ton. Can you give us some reference prices and trends in VAM across your geographies? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think that's one of the big differences we saw in third quarter, Jeff, as we saw VAM in China, which had still been running quite attractively, I'd say, kind of $1,400, $1,500, really come down to about $1,000 a ton at the - by the end of the third quarter, which is, we believe, pretty much at the cost curve in China. So that's been a big change. And again, tied directly to paints and coatings as a large percentage of our emulsions go into paints and coatings. I mean, to give you an idea, we saw about 15% to 20% drop in emulsions demand globally in the third quarter. In Europe, I think we're also starting to see some compression in the margins for acid and VAM. I don't have the exact number for VAM right now in Europe on the tip of my tongue. But in Europe - I mean, sorry, in the U.S., it's holding up a bit better, although we start to see some softening there. Again, I think the softening outside of China is more on destocking necessarily than absolute demand, but in China, which I think is the easiest reference price, we see VAM coming down to about $1,000 per ton, which again is probably right at the cost curve for VAM in China. Jeff Zekauskas : And then just to follow-up, I think in Scott's script, he said that he's confident in paying down debt in '23 across a wide variety of macro scenarios, and then you said that in the most challenging one, you have a detailed playbook. Can you give us an idea what the detailed playbook is and what a most challenging scenario would be like? Scott Richardson : Yes, Jeff, I think, two times I think over the past 15 or so years where we've had to really pull back hard with a heavy focus on near-term cash, and I think that was coming out of the economic crisis, 2008 and '09, and then again in the early days of COVID in 2020, and that really focuses around cash collection and harvesting of cash, which, as I mentioned before, we feel very comfortable with as we work our way into the first part of next year. And then it's a heavy focus on capital and what capital needs. Our manufacturing teams have done a great job being able to flex as needed even on large capital projects. If you recall, we paused the Clear Lake acetic acid expansion back in 2020, and then we're able to utilize that time to lower the overall cost of that project, but significantly reduce the capital and we were able to bring our CapEx spend, which was expected to be north of $500 million in 2020, down to around $300 million. And so we are in process, as I mentioned earlier, of looking at where those levers are for 2023 both across our legacy portfolio as well as the M&M CapEx spend, so that we can focus really around near-term productivity as well as cost reduction. And if there are projects that can be paused, we will do that. Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Lori, I think in the script you said that $13 to $14 plus of EPS for next year did not assume a recession because you're not seeing that in your order book. Can you give us a sense of what a recessionary range for '23 would be if we do indeed go into recession? is it $12 to $14, $10 to $12? What would you think on a high level? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, Vincent, I don't really have a number for that. I think if we just look at current demand conditions, and especially at auto, I think everybody is pretty consistent and thinking auto is continuing to go up next year. I don't find that surprising, that's consistent with what we're hearing from customers. I mean, we've had three years of very low auto production. We think there's still a lot of pent-up demand. We think supply will continue to be the determining factor for auto, so supply of chips and other materials is what will be the determining factor. Now, obviously, as interest rates go up, there may be some regions where that has some impact. But quite frankly, we think auto, which, especially with M&M, is now a significant part of our portfolio again, is really an upside for next year. And so I think in that way, this - if we do go into recession, I mean, it's a little bit different this time, in that, usually in a recession - I mean, a couple of things - usually in a recession, you see energy start to come down and then prices with it. In this case, energy is staying up because of geopolitical concerns. So that's a little bit different. We're seeing full employment, especially here in the U.S. which is why I think we're not seeing some of the impacts in the U.S. because although people are being hit by inflation, there is full employment, so it doesn't feel as hard as most recessions where you see a lot of layoffs and people without jobs. And then I think the third thing is auto. I mean, auto is usually one of the leading indicators of a recession and a drop in demand for autos. And in fact, we see it going the other way in this recession. So we haven't really modeled, what I would call, a recessionary scenario. And because we just don't see it happening, even if technically, mathematically it's calculated as a recession, we don't see that. Scott Richardson : The other thing I would add to that, Vincent, is with the synergies that we have, we've already increased our synergy number for year one, expect to have between $100 million and $135 million of full achieved synergies next year. And if we see continued demand decline in non-auto segment, then we'll look for ways in which to flex and accelerate further synergies. So we do feel very confident of being able to get to that range that we put in the prepared comments. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And as a follow-up, the prepared comments had a discussion which you've already done with the plant footprint, particularly in the Acetyl Chain with some reductions. But how are you thinking about how you're going to run the Chain in '23? And I guess, in particular, how is the Clear Lake expansion coming and how could that play a role in '23? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so I think - if we look at this year, we have already reduced our rates in the Acetyl Chain in China and in Singapore down to 50% or 70% of our capacity and we did that because we see demand. We don't want to build a lot of inventory. We've seen demand come off. So we've already taken that step. In some areas we've gone down to as little as 30% of operating capacity, like in emulsions, where we've seen the big drop there. So I think we've been really proactive in managing our response, that's obviously cost savings, but we're really focused on aligning our actions with the customer demand. Similarly in Frankfurt, given the high cost, energy cost in Frankfurt and the softening demand in Europe, we've reduced our POM rates at Frankfurt, again, to align our demand with our - the customer demand with our own production. And we've made the decision for the VAM plant in Frankfurt to go ahead and keep that unit down until we see demand coming back. I mean, the good news is, all of the steps we're taking, this is still economic capacity. We'd still make money if we ran it, but we just don't see enough demand, so we can optimize our chain better by moving molecules around the globe and using lower-cost capacity, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast, to meet some of these global demand now that we have less global demand. And so you're going to continue to see actions like that as I - as we go into 2023. What I would say is, look, VAM is ready in Frankfurt when we start to see this come back hopefully by the end of the first quarter, we'll be able to start that unit up. Everything else is just a matter of lifting the rate, so that's today's decision to do it, so that's easy. And on Clear Lake, what I would say about Clear Lake is, we are on track to mechanically complete and start up the unit in the first half. We intend to do so. Again, the justification for that project was productivity. We called out about $100 million a year in productivity. So even if we see no need to run additional capacity in the Gulf Coast, we will run that unit for productivity and get the $100 million savings - run rate savings, I should say, the first year will obviously be that much, but run that unit for productivity. And then we have the option if we see something similar happen as we saw happened in '21 where we see a run-up in demand or if there are operating issues around the globe, we can start running that unit at higher rates and get even additional margin from that. Vincent Andrews : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Lori, can you speak to a bridge between the rough run rate of $500 million that you referenced for M&M this year to the target of $800 million that you have for 2023. I appreciate that you've owned it just a few days and I imagine it's difficult. But in formulating that $800 million number, what are you baking in for things like price-cost spread or normalization of volumes or perhaps the cross-selling or other company-specific actions that you mentioned? Any broad strokes-related color there I think would be really helpful. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, I don't have a bridge. As you said, we've wholly-owned it three days, so we're still working on what are we learning, what can we immediately go do about it. So we're really been focused on not worrying so much about what happened in the past, but okay, how can we do this differently in the future. But I would say, it's really more based on our own experience of what levers to pull. I mean, there are some things like foreign currency, that was about $20 million in November, December, that we think we can go rectify maybe not November, December, but in next year. And so you annualize that, that I don't know, I just make up a number here, say that's $50 million or something. And then if you look at volume, they've lost about 15% market share. If we can through pricing and through cross-selling recover that, that's a fairly large number. Remember, the DuPont number in 2021 for EBITDA was seven-some-ish - $750 million, something like that, so in the 700s. So just recovering the volume that they had sold and taking care of some of the other factors that didn't exist in '21, like the currency, I think pretty quickly gets us back to $800 million. So those are the things that we're focused on. And then as Scott said, we will start to see some synergies as early as January 1st. We will have some synergies from office closures where we have overlapping office sites, like Seoul and Singapore and others. So there are synergies that will come in there as well. I mean, obviously, we'll account for those separately. But I think - and then we have the new raw material contract that will come into play in January, which will give us flexibility which will also be a source of value for us. So I wish I could give you a better bridge. We just don't have that level of detail yet because at this point we're really trying to identify what's the 10 levers to go pull, let's get those in actions and then we'll quantify them all. But again, based on our own experience, based on where DuPont was in '21, we feel this is the lift we can make to get to $800 million if we get the organization really focused on it and really pushing towards it. Kevin McCarthy : Fair enough. And I appreciate the color there. My second question is more in the spirit of clarification and maybe housekeeping for Scott. What is the amount of transaction-related amortization that's embedded in the incremental D&A of $350 million that you referenced? And moving forward, would you intend to include that or exclude that from your adjusted EPS in 2023? Scott Richardson : Yes, so of that $350 million, Kevin, the best way to think about right now is about a third of that would be base business depreciation and then two-thirds amortization. And that's an estimate right now we'll be working through that here in the fourth quarter, and we would not be adjusting that out of our adjustments, so we'll include that. We will certainly provide color as to what that amount is, but we don't plan to adjust it out. Kevin McCarthy : Okay, excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First, just two quick ones on asset yields. First, the sequential decline in EBIT for Acetyl Chain in 4Q, obviously, prices are down, volumes are down. But can you just help us with, if, in 4Q, there is any sort of one-time either fixed cost absorption hit as you're running your assets lower or high cost inputs running through that shouldn't carry forward into '23? And second you mentioned industry margins being unsustainably low. I guess, when you look at previous times kind of we've gone through this in the industry, what sort of the usual time before that resolves itself? Or are you seeing supply-demand start to balance itself out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, there's really no, I'd say, one-time things. I mean, we've just seen deterioration through third quarter in terms of pricing and in terms of demand, again, specifically China, Europe, less so in the U.S. Especially as I called out that drop in emulsions demand now that is like 15% to 20% down globally versus where we've been. So I can only describe the fourth quarter conditions as now kind of sub-foundational. Again, we think mostly it's seasonal. We think it's destocking, there is an end to destocking because people - so I don't think it can get much worse, let's be honest. And then one of the reasons is when we see it in our order books, I mean, orders have stabilized, again, now at this lower level, but they've stabilized again. And so that's why we're saying. Look, we think that's continued through the first quarter, and then as we move back into the construction season, hopefully, we see some movement in China on COVID, but we've said that before. And as maybe people getting more confidence in Europe, and again, construction season comes back, we do expect towards the end of the first quarter to start seeing recovery into more of a foundational level. Mike Leithead : Great. That's helpful. And then second for Scott. I just wanted to dig in on the M&M currency exposure issue. I think, obviously, you have pretty good visibility into the M&M country mix ahead of close. So was it a net hedging issue in M&M or a mismatch of sales and COGS currency? Just trying to get a sense of what was different when you got under the hood there. Scott Richardson : Yes, I think, we expect the annual impact this year to be about $100 million, which is not unlike the impact that we have in totality at Celanese today, and so it's a little higher weighting than what we see in our base Engineered Materials business. And I would kind of chalk it up to two things, one, a lot more cost in dollars in terms of what moves through and then more sales in local currencies whereas Celanese typically would sell in some of those countries on a dollar basis. So those are the two things we're looking at from a business risk perspective of where we can make changes and where we can combine the power of the kind of in-country businesses that we have going forward. And I would also say there's certain things that, at the enterprise level, we can do to help mitigate that. Lori alluded to some of those earlier. And we'll be looking at that as well, and hopefully, we should get some run rate benefit in the early part of next year from those actions. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Mike Sison : Hi, good morning. In terms of your outlook for '23, does that assumes the normal foundational adjusted EBIT for the Acetyl Chain, in that, I think it's about $1 billion to $1.1 billion range? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, Mike, obviously, we were a little hesitant to even give '23 guidance. But - so what I would say is, so for 2023 if we think on the low-end of what we're thinking of for Acetyl, I would say, we're assuming first quarter is some foundational and then recovery. So if you think about that, second quarter is probably foundational, third quarter, fourth quarter. Let me just talk about foundational a little bit of what that means. So we always meant foundational was meant to capture the low-end of the typical range. We didn't really capture recessionary conditions. As we said, we're kind of seeing that in Acetyl. And so again, we believe fourth quarter this year and early 2023 will be sub-foundational. And then we have some seasonality in the fourth quarter, so again it's for a year average. But I think if you analyze even Q4 what we're calling out for Acetyls, that's $900 million and that's sub-foundational. So I think if you look at what is foundational really mean, it's probably more in the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion area, with $1.2 billion being after we finished the Clear Lake expansion, so just for some clarity. So I would say, next year, it's kind of on average for the year at that foundational level or a little bit lower at the lower-end as we all know this market can move very quickly if we have some industry outages or anything else that causes, because we are still like at pretty high utilization in the Acetyl Chain. So - but that's how we're thinking about next year and how we're thinking about it relative to foundational earnings. Mike Sison : Got it. And the base adjusted EBIT - I'm sorry, the base Engineered Materials business '22 you're close to $800 million adjusted EBITDA, and I think you mentioned you felt there could be some growth, and maybe just maybe talk about what type of growth and where you'll see it from, and if you have any specifics, great. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so the growth that we're expecting there is double-digit. I would say, it's the things that I called out earlier, Mike. I mean, it's the growth in auto, it's the margin lift in GUR due to full utilization, it's the margin lift in LCP due to high utilization and growing 5G applications, it's getting the full value from Santoprene now that we've had the opportunity to take pricing actions and other actions to get Santoprene margins so - and getting the full value of KEPCO for the year as well as kind of double-digit growth that we've been seeing in medical. So I'd say, those are the biggest factors driving that double-digit growth in margins for that heritage Celanese EM business. Mike Sison : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. John McNulty : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So maybe a question for Scott, when you look to better match the interest lines and the debt to kind of counter the FX impacts. I guess, can you speak to at least based on current rates what that might mean for your interest expense, is it - does it send it up a bit, does it send it down, I guess, how should we be thinking about that? Scott Richardson : Well, I think in those currencies where we have exposure of any size, I think we would - it would lower the overall interest expense. However, John, we're going to be careful with when we do that, obviously those currencies have depreciated pretty substantially this year and so there's a balance between interest expense versus then depending on when you move that over the end up having ultimately more leverage as that currency moves. So we're going to be balanced in how we look at that, but we do see some opportunity as we get into the next year to help with some of that business exposure. John McNulty : Got it. Fair enough. And then on the M&M front, in terms of the - it sounds like they've been really running pretty hard just because they kind of had to do with take-or-pays and what have you. I guess, can you quantify what the inventory build is versus kind of what you view as normal, and how much we could see in terms of working capital release just out of that asset alone? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I don't know that we have those numbers, and again we're going to be taking some steps in the fourth quarter, that will continue into next year to use DuPont material to preplace our own purchases of polymer and different things. So I don't think we have a really firm number on that yet. Scott Richardson : Yes, John, normal is different as we go forward because you're putting these two portfolios together, and so we're looking at what is the optimal mix. It's going to be different by region as well depending on where our business has historically been from mainly in nylon standpoint, but we're really looking at how we can leverage the power really of both portfolios that we're bringing together right now. John McNulty : Fair point. Makes sense. Thanks very much for the color. Scott Richardson : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. P.J. Juvekar: Yes, thank you, Lori and Scott. You talked about Acetyls and you always do a great job in managing the situation globally to utilization of different plants. A question on the Frankfurt plant. It's your highest cost, do you think there is a chance that it becomes a stranded asset? And what kind of headwinds do you expect in Europe, given your large footprint there in Europe as well as in Germany? Lori Ryerkerk : P.J., just a clarification, you're talking about the Frankfurt VAM plant or POM plant. P.J. Juvekar: VAM plant, sorry. Lori Ryerkerk : VAM. Okay, thank you. I just wanted to be - question. Look, we have five VAM assets globally. Historically, Frankfurt has not been our highest plant - cost plant. So let me just be clear on that. And even today, we could run it and it could run at a profit, but it's just volume we can get somewhere else more cheaply right now because of the very high prices that we had been seeing in terms of the European energy, and then, quite frankly, when it gets cold, we expect to see those prices again. So I don't really see a possibility of it becoming a stranded asset. I mean, it's only been about three months ago we were running every single plant we had all out and still not able to meet the demand. So I do think demand is going to come back and I think we will need all the plants we have. And Frankfurt VAM has always been a very profitable plant. This is just a unique situation with the European energy prices we're seeing, coupled with the fairly rapid drop in demand that we've seen because of other - the geopolitical factors, the China COVID, and then winterization kind of all coming together at the same time. So I don't really see any possibility that becomes a stranded asset. Scott Richardson : Yes, P.J., I would just add that this theme of the power of our network is very important whether it's VAM, whether it's acetic acid, whether it's POM, and now as we bring M&M in, nylon, PBT, et cetera. We have created we believe a lot of value over time by flexing these networks, and having those assets in Europe are great assets. And so bringing that concept and leveraging that as we bring these portfolios together with M&M is something that we're going to be working hard here in the fourth quarter to see how we want to operate as we get into next year for that business as well. P.J. Juvekar: Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned you made a lot of comments on M&M and we appreciate that. One of the things you say in your prepared comments is that, that business had lagged in pricing since 2021. So maybe is there a one-time step-up in pricing that maybe we have under-appreciated? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I - look, I think - and I talked a little bit about this earlier. I think their total pricing hasn't necessarily lagged. I think it's really distinguishing between the differentiated business where you had room to move pricing and the more standard business where in fact we've seen a lot of price pressures from competitors where in fact maybe it would have been better to take down pricing and not lose so much market share. So I think it's just a more fine-tune approach to pricing that we want to take. I wouldn't necessarily say it just means prices will go up, it will really be about trying to maximize the margin kind of dollar contribution versus any other signal. P.J. Juvekar: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions is coming from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your questions. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori and Scott. I'm just trying to sort of get a better sense, it was asked earlier, of what you actually feel trough EBITDA would be. I mean, I know that the guidance that you guys gave for Q4 obviously a seasonally weak quarter. So obviously, Q4, one can sort of extrapolate that. To me, it just seems like Q3 was the worst of everything, right? I mean you had destocking, high sort of energy prices be it in Europe and the like, acetic prices coming down as hard as they did. So I mean, is it fair to assume that the 600-and-change-million in quarterly EBITDA that you guys generated in Q3 is possibly the right run rate annualized number to think about in terms of trough EBITDA? Lori Ryerkerk : Sorry, Hassan, I'm just trying to understand your question better. The 600-and-change in EBITDA for Acetyl? Hassan Ahmed : No, just, I mean, as - overall as a company, what do you think your trough EBITDA number would be? Scott Richardson : I mean, I'll be honest with you, Hassan. I mean, we really look at each environment differently. I mean, troughs, recessions, et cetera, I mean, it's hard to put labels on different things. I mean, at the end of the day, I think the - what we've stated we're pushing towards to get to for next year just given the current conditions would suggest that somewhere in that Q3 range is probably somewhere close to that, but I think a lot - every situation is different, and it's really about making sure that we are managing the business on a daily basis to maximize earnings, to maximize cash flow and value creation. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough, fair enough. And now just moving on from that more specific on the Acetyl Chain, you talked about pricing being around $400 a ton, hitting sort of the cost curve side of things and the like. So two things. One is, are you - in the industry, seeing sort of shutdowns at these levels? That's the first part of it. The second part of it is that in your prepared remarks, you obviously talked about operating rates for you guys in China and Singapore being 50% to 70%, the emulsions business reducing the tons sold by 15% and the like, yet your volumes sequentially were only down 4%, so just trying to reconcile that as well. So two parts, one, shutdowns, and two, why your volumes weren't weaker than what's your commentary suggested? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so I would say, we saw the decline through the quarter. So the start of the quarter was actually at a much higher pricing, the average price for the third quarter - or the average China assets for third quarter was around $430 and now we're down around $400. So we've continued to continue to see pricing declines. So I'd say, the start of the quarter was stronger than we started to see a pretty rapid. And I think that's why you didn't see the volumes dropped so much. The actions we've taken to really cut our rates have happened here at the very end of the quarter and going into October. So I probably wasn't clear on that. And so I think that's why you don't see it as much in the volumes, but again around $400. To your first question, though, I would say we have seen others take actions to slowdown as we have, but not yet to shut down. But given the pricing, I mean, we are still the most economic producer of acetic acid in China. We know this is at the cost curve, so we know others are struggling. I think given if this goes on longer, you may see people continue to slow-down rates or shutdown even if only temporarily. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew Blair : Hi, Lori, you mentioned that, in autos, your build rates are outpacing industry averages, especially in North America and Europe. Could you talk about your total autos build rate and how that compares to global averages and overall the reception that you're getting with EV penetration? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think - so on autos, I think IHS thought we're at 6% growth rate. We have seen - we think it's a little bit less than that. But I think we have outpaced auto builds pretty significantly across all of our businesses. I'm trying to remember the number off the top of my head. But let me answer the EV question first. So EV, we're proud for the legacy business. We're more than 10% of our volume into auto goes into EV. And obviously from a value standpoint, it's much higher than that because we have tend to be high end applications. The majority of that is lithium-ion battery separator films, so GUR, which is what we will see margin expansion in next year because it is sold out and limited. You compare that for the industry, these make up about 8.5% of the fleet - of the builds today. So even just in the EV space, we're several percent higher than the rest of the industry. And then as I said, everywhere else we see that we continue to outpace the industry. So industry growth rates, just to give you, so Europe was down in the third quarter, North America was up a bit, we were a bit better in both of those than the industry. And in Asia I think maybe to give you an idea, Asia saw a strong industry growth, about 21% in Asia, 30% in China, and with the additional volume from KEPCO, the growth in EVs, the project pipeline, the GUR expansion, the stuff we've done on Asia localization, we were up - well, really 27% globally, a lot of that in Asia, and all of our regions were up about 20% versus last year. And again, we think that's on chip availability, but it also shows the strength of our project pipeline in our portfolio, and the fact that we tend to be stronger in EV and stronger into high-end applications, which has not been as challenged as maybe some of the other models. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Brandon Ayache : Darrel, go ahead and make the next question our last one, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew DeYoe : Morning, everyone. As we look at the cadence for M&M of next year, you'd kind of mentioned a fairly sharp inventory correction that's working through the pipe. Do you expect that will continue into next year? And I guess, how much of this $800 million do you think will come from second half earnings versus first half earnings if we try to think about the arch for that business? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think, look, just given the time it takes, we start actions immediately. These are already started. And - but all of these things take some time. And so I would definitely expect the heritage M&M business earnings to be more heavily back-end loaded in the year than in the first part of the year, just to give us time to kind of work through the changes we need to do, get all of the commercial teams coming from M&M onto the pipeline model, which will be happening in here across the first quarter, definitely a more of a second half load than the first half. Scott Richardson : Yes, and the inventory pull-down likely more first half, Matthew, as we work to get that material into the legacy Celanese assets. Matthew DeYoe : Understood. And I guess if I could just squeeze one more. In the past you've talked about rationalizing foreign capacity on the startup of Clear Lake, but that talk kind of waned, and I wasn't sure if that was because the macro was better or you'd rewritten some of the raw material contracts in Singapore. So I guess with the macro where it is, should we think about rationalizing forward capacity is still on the table? And if it's not, are the productivity savings of the $100 million still reasonable if the macro remains soft? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, look, let me start with the last question first. The productivity of $100 million, it's still stable even in a softer macro. It was really based on running two units not quite as full and had catalyst savings and other things in it. So that continues to exist. We didn't need any growth. And we will always run Clear Lake more fall due to the raw material advantages there. So I don't think the project credits associated with the Clear Lake expansion are not at risk, again because they were baked on productivity. As I said earlier, if we see an upswing in the market and we can run it even fuller, that's just actually additional credit that we'll get at that time. And in terms of the global footprint and we talked about this, gosh, probably over a year ago or so, we really with the change in the contract we've gotten of Singapore utilities, other contracts that we have in China, we like having optionality. That optionality to move things around depending on what's going on to accommodate or when we have turnarounds and those sorts of things by shifting production to other parts of the world, that has more than paid off for us. And so we like having that optionality in our footprint. So I wouldn't expect any major changes in that going forward. Matthew DeYoe : Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Brandon Ayache for any closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Darrel. We'd like to thank everybody for listening in today. As always, we're around if you have any follow up questions. Darrel, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy your weekend.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Celanese's Q4 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, VP of Investor Relations, Brandon Ayache. Please go ahead, Brandon. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Kevin. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese Corporation distributed its fourth quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both press release as well as prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Since we've published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll go directly to your questions. Kevin, let's go ahead and please the line of questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. And we do ask you ask one question, one follow-up and then return to the queue. John, please go ahead. John McNulty : Yes, good morning, Lori. Thanks for taking my questions. So, look, obviously a lot of moving pieces out there, but the tough first quarter outlook for a $1.50 to $1.75 of EPS makes the full year call for $12 to $13, look like a pretty chunky jump. I guess, can you help us to bridge that jump in earnings and help us to understand what some of the big buckets are that you expect to turn up or take a noticeable step-up? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, John. Yes, look, we realize that looks like a big jump-up. But let's kind of go through the math. We really need to deliver about 350 for the last three quarters of the year in order to hit that $12 to $13 guidance. So if you look at that, well, that seems like a big jump, it's not unknown territory to us. In fact, that's where we've been every quarter in the last two years up until this quarter. But if I look at just the jump-up from Q1 to Q2, let's start with Acetyls. So in Acetyls, I would expect $50 million to a $100 million increase in Q2 off of Q1. We'll start with natural gas. So natural gas pricing has come down significantly at the end of the fourth quarter and in the first-quarter, especially in the U.S., that's a big help for us in Acetyls, the largest plants in Clear Lake, we have a lot of other facilities in the U.S. that benefit from that lower natural gas pricing. And with coal staying higher in China and with crude being reasonably high and steady, that really benefits margins for our U.S.-based production, which is a large portion of our Acetyl. So if you look just at this natural gas pricing, if it were to hold through the second quarter that alone is probably more than $20 million of uplift in the second quarter. And then if we look at things like the Frankfurt VAM restart, that is being restarted a little bit early based on the good increase we've seen here going into March. For construction, paints and coatings in Europe a little bit quicker recovery than we expected, so that Western seasonality coming off, that's probably another $10 million. And then you just have the normal good economics we typically experienced in the second quarter. So we see destocking really been over. We're past Chinese New Year, we see improvement in construction activities worldwide. And so we expect to see that same kind of volume rebound. As well as productivity, I mean, we last year in 2022, our productivity at the high range of our historic 100 to 150, we expect we'll be in a similar level this year and adding on additional productivity from M&M for the EM side. So that all goes in there. So we feel very comfortable right now with where energy pricing is, that were actually probably towards the higher-end of that range for the Acetyl bump-up in the second-quarter. And then if we look at Engineered Materials and including M&M, again, Q2 is typically a stronger quarter for Engineered Materials as well. For a lot of the same reasons, we do see the -- well, first, let me start with this. I mean, we have seen just like natural gas in Acetyls, we have seen significant drop in raw material costs in the first quarter, which is extending through into the second quarter. This lower raw-material costs has led us to build lower or not build, but now replaced higher-cost inventory with lower-cost inventory. So that alone, as we go into the second quarter is going to be about a $40 million lift for the EM, M&M portfolio combined as we go into -- as we have the second quarter. And then again, we have the typical the destocking because it is pretty much finished here at the end-of-the first-quarter we actually see really good improvement here in March in our order books. We see we are past Chinese New Year so we start seeing the lift from that I mean, to give you an idea we are seen February we started the month flow, but we are still seeing orders coming in today for February deliveries. So, this is a big deal, usually at this time in the month, our orders had stopped, and we don't see new orders come in until the next month but we're still seeing orders for EM, for M&M for February and our March book quite frankly, it has filled up for both the legacy EM and the legacy M&M businesses, consistent with the order book that we received in March of 2022. So I think these are all really strong proof points to say, you know, we are seeing the demand recovery coming now as we're moving through the end of February and into March and we expect that build to continue to grow through the second quarter. We are seeing modest improvement in our -- in automotive production, builds a pretty much flat but people are not destocking anymore. So we're seeing order patterns restore closer to normal levels for automotive and this is very typical with what we also saw coming out of the end of '21 and into '22. So I think we feel really good about it, uplift in EM in the magnitude of $50 million to $100 million as well. And then on top of that, we also will have additional synergies from the M&M acquisition and we expect another uplift of $10 million to $20 million in synergies in the second quarter, our first quarter as well. And like I said, that's still again productivity continues. So I think we feel quite comfortable in the guidance that we've provided for Q2 based on everything that we see happening now in terms of raw material, energy pricing and recovery of market as indicated by our order books for March. John McNulty : Got it. That's hugely helpful color. And then I guess just as the follow-up, just maybe a quick one on the debt redomiciling, it sounds like you're kind of part of the way there now, I guess. Can we think about all of this being done by the first half of the year? Is that the right way to think about it? Or you guys waiting for something in particular to maybe change in the markets like, I guess, how should we think about that because it does seem like the rates are lower as you're starting to refinance some of this debt out? Scott Richardson : Yes, thanks, John. I think we're going to be opportunistic here. I think we're looking and making sure we have the right opportunities, I mean, currencies are moving in the right direction. We didn't want to make those changes when the dollar was certainly at its strongest because then as things move certainly from an absolute debt perspective, it would go against us. So we're going to continue to look for the right opportunities there and we're certainly targeting to get it done here in the first half, but just depending on some of those movements and where the dollar is at, it may linger into the second -- the early part of the second half. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Your line is now live. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Lori, in your prepared comments you talked about some of the competitiveness on the EM side. I think it was specific upon imports from or exports from Asia into Europe, et cetera. How do you see that dynamic playing out, you know, as the rest of the year unfolds, is it as simple as China reopens and there's more localized demand and so that takes care of that or what are you thinking about at this point on that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Ghansham. Yes, look, you're exactly right. I think there's two factors and we're really starting to see. Early in first quarter, we still had some material moving over from Asia, we expect that will be mostly done in the second quarter and for the two factors, one, that you called out. As we see demand picking-up in Asia, there's less incentive to put things on a boat, move it to Europe. But secondly with these low-energy prices that we're seeing and the ability to replace our higher-cost inventory with lower-cost inventory, that's resulting in better pricing for our European customers and so the arbitrage we expect will be closing here at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so that I think really helps restore the supply demand dynamics. That of course, we are seeing much higher demand now starting to really seeing demand pickup in Europe here in March in particular and we expect that to continue into the second quarter. So with higher demand, lower pricing for the customers because of energy and raw material costing and then higher demand in China making it less attractive to ship across. We think those three factors actually combined should resolve the situation in the second quarter. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Great. And then in terms of the sort of the macroeconomic construct, so China you touched on in terms of momentum, just given the sequence of events there. Europe, you just touched on that as well. What about North-America as an offset as it relates to slow down sequentially, how do you see that evolving in '23? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I would say, North America has been a bit sluggish in the first quarter. So far we've seen more recovery in Europe as we go into March than we have so far in North America. But we don't have any reasons to think North America also isn't going to get there in the second quarter. I mean, auto builds are strong, we see signs that the destocking is over. Again, natural gas pricing in the U.S. and raw material pricing should expect North America to come back strongly as well. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. JeffZekauskas: Thanks very much. Can you tell us what the EBITDA of the M&M business was in 2022? And in the old days I think you guys thought it was $900 million in EBITDA. And plainly, it's operating at a much, much lower level. Can you diagnose what happened that is through these structural problems or raw material problems? And how much of the nylon is sold at monthly contract price and you know right now of that M&M business? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so Jeff, in 2022, we had expected back at the time of the purchase we expected 2022 to come in at about $500 million of EBITDA. Obviously with the year end challenges in M&M, that number was a little bit lower than that. Now, I think -- we had thought originally that in 2022, they'd be at 800, that's been a more typical number for M&M, we believe we could grow that to 900, now we're saying 700 for next year. If you look at what happened in 2022, I think there was a number of factors. First is with a take-or-pay contract that they had for raw materials, although they saw weakening demand they continue to produce, and that led to a lot of inventory and that sort of tie into what I'm going say about fourth quarter. Raw materials were fairly high for the year, compressing margin for nylon for the M&M assets as well, but we saw a lot of demand destruction and we thought, especially in Asia, we thought a lot on standard grades and. I think as we talked about last quarter. What we saw was a desire to maintain margin in M&M, but as a result, they lost a significant volume on standard grades by trying to hold prices when other prices were coming down. So, volume loss, at the same time, they weren't raising prices on premium grades which they could have been doing with raw material pricing going up. And these are things that we've had to work on. So we've really been working on pricing over the last three months, trying to drive more volume and standard grade trying to raise pricing in other grades. We've really been working the product pipeline. We've been working cross selling, we've really the team has been doing a great job working all of these things to really drive back to where we believe we should be at that $800 million EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023, obviously these things take a few quarters to get going, but we do think we'll be back at that maybe kind of historical level DuPont had of $800 million by the -- again, by the end of 2023. In terms of contracts, I'm not really sure, Jeff, to tell you truth in terms of what percentage of the M&M contracts are monthly versus three or six months or something longer. Jeff Zekauskas : Right. So in terms of getting the $700 million in EBITDA this year, you'd have to average, I don't know, $200 million or so for the next -- for the second, third and fourth quarters. How does the profitability lift from 80 to 90 to that 200 level? How do you accomplish that? Especially because when you read about Nylon 66, the general commentary from consultants is that there's overcapacity and margin pressure. Is the background getting tougher, but it's your own innovation or ways to change the business that's improving it? What are these dynamics that are lifting it in an adverse environment -- if the environment is adverse? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So look, a big piece of it is synergy capture. If you look at our outlook now, which is at the upper end of the $100 million to $135 million range for synergies. We've achieved about $10 million of that. We think we'll get about $10 million of that in the first quarter. That leaves $120 million for 3 million more quarters. So that's about a $40 million per quarter average uplift. Now obviously, it's a little bit more skewed towards the back end, but let's think about average for the next three quarters. So it's about $40 million right there from synergy uplift. That gets you to the kind of $120 million to $130 million range. And then we are getting volume recovery. As I said, our March order book is now for M&M basically where it was in March '22 for M&M. And that was still -- the first part of the year was better for M&M. So we have gotten some volume recovery in -- from Vital in particular and in Asia. Again, auto builds are very consistent, and they're not still back to 2019 levels, but they're consistent. And so we think with volume recovery, we have been pushing through pricing on differentiated products, right? So if you look at all of those things, if you look at productivity as well, not synergy, but regular productivity at our M&M plan, we expect to probably get another, I don't know, $40 million, $50 million from that this year. So if you look at all those things and start adding up those volumes and the recovery, M&M was affected in fourth quarter and early part of first quarter with the very same factors we were, right, with the same destocking, with the same seasonality and slowdown -- and we are seeing them recover from that as well, again, in March and as we move forward into second quarter. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now live. Josh Spector : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, first, I wanted to ask on the [indiscernible] JV. Can you talk about how much cash you'll be getting into from that combination? A bit confused by the comments in the release about 0.7x leverage reduction, 12 months post close, if that's related with that or not? It seems like a big number, if it is. So can you clarify? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, absolutely. So we expect to net $400 million to $450 million that we can apply towards debt reduction from the food ingredient's deal. We think -- I have to say we're really excited about this deal. We're really excited about the JV structure that we've agreed to with Mitsui. If I back up a bit, we also, at the same time, announced the extension of our joint venture for the Fairway Methanol joint venture. This has been a great joint venture for us. Mitsui has proven to be a really great partner. And I think it's been really financially beneficial for both companies as well as strategically beneficial. And we see food ingredients being in addition to that strong relationship that we built with them through the years. This is really what we were looking for. We've looked at this product for some time and thought it's not necessarily a core piece of our portfolio, but it is a core piece of our operations in Frankfurt. And so by doing a joint venture, we think, one, we'll really benefit from the expertise that Mitsui has in food and nutrition and their ability to market and help us on that end. We think they will also benefit from us continuing to be able to integrate into our acetyl chain. We provide acetic acid and crotonaldehyde into the -- now into the Fairway joint venture. And we'll continue to benefit from the strong partnership that we have as well as the manufacturing synergies because we will continue to operate the joint venture, and it is very embedded into our Frankfurt operations. And it allows both of us to participate in growth in what we think will be -- continue to be a high-growth market for food ingredients, store base and sweeteners as -- especially as one of the few, maybe only Western company providing sweeteners anyway of this type, we see a lot of positive movement in terms of volumes and demand and pricing going forward. So again, we're really excited about it. And just to reiterate, to answer your question, we do expect to be able to pay off another $400 million to $450 million of debt as a result of this joint venture. Scott Richardson : Yes. And then, Josh, with regards to the covenants, the way our covenants are structured is gain on sale of assets is included in EBITDA. And so because this has a very low book basis, and while it's an efficient transaction, that $450 million will be largely gained. So you get the gain that goes into the EBITDA piece, using then the cash proceeds to pay down debt at the same time. And there's a partial offset, obviously, in EBITDA from the 70% that would go to Mitsui. But that math then works out to be because it's in EBITDA, about a 0.7% reduction for the debt covenant purposes. Josh Spector : Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe just one clarification there. Is that gain, are you going to exclude that from your adjusted EBITDA? And that's in the -- I guess, the debt accounted for EBITDA? And in your comments about free cash flow, you reiterated the $1 billion plus. Can you just give us an idea of what the core free cash flow you're expecting at this point, some of the movements between working capital, restructuring, et cetera? Scott Richardson : Yes. So for adjusted EPS, we will go ahead and exclude that gain as we do have past transactions. And then on free cash flow, we had previously said $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which included about a $200 million improvement overall in working capital. If we see that same $200 million improvement in working capital and we saw inventories move up a little bit just with the lower demand in the fourth quarter, then we would see free cash flow likely a little lower than that 1.5 billion just because of the lower earnings that we have. So we're still working through kind of exactly how the working capital will play out this year. But if we see something in that range, we would expect to be a little bit lighter than the $1.5 billion. Operator : Next question is coming from Michael Leithead from Barclays. Your line is now live. Michael Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question on pension. Your $12 to $13 a share EPS guide, I believe, includes $100 million hit year-over-year on pension. When you talked last quarter about $13 to $14 a share, how much pension were you impact are you expecting at that time? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks, Mike. So I'm actually going to kind of put some of the other buckets in here that change from our previous $13 to $14 guidance. D&A actually came in about $75 million better than we expected, but it was eaten up by a pretty good chunk by that pension. So kind of approach that amount. It's a little lower than that 75%, but it was approaching that. And so I think when you kind of largely neutral those two things together, but it was in that range. Michael Leithead : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just more of a segmentation or clarification question, but it seems like M&M EBITDA, if I'm reading correctly, is sort of allocated between earnings and EM and from centralized or other costs and other. So if you do deliver, say, 7.25 EBITDA from the M&M business this year, is it correct to interpret that we'll actually see it reported at something like 8.25 or so higher in EM EBITDA, but also, I don't know, $100 million or so higher other costs to offset that. Is that the correct interpretation? Scott Richardson : Yes. I think that's right, Mike. It's certainly in that range. I mean, at the end of the day, we need to get no matter what bucket it's falling in, we need to go deliver the EBITDA over time that we said this business would deliver. So it is about getting the base business back up into those ranges that we had originally set at the time of the deal in that $800 million EBITDA, including the other costs in there and then driving synergies on top of that. So this year with where demand is at, given some of the higher cost inventory that had to be worked off at the beginning of the year, it's going to be a little bit lower. But then building that back and then putting synergies on top of that is exactly what Tom Kelly and the team are focused on. Michael Leithead : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Vincent Andrews : Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a quick clarification around the subject made on the prior question. For M&M in the fourth quarter, you had guided to $50 million to $60 million of EBITDA. And then there are kind of two numbers discussed in the prepared remarks, one is 56, one is 39, which is the actual apples-to-apples comparison, the 39 or the 56? Scott Richardson : It's a 39. Lori Ryerkerk : It's a 39. Scott Richardson : Yes. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then if I could ask this is the first quarter I can remember and I don't know how long where your volume in automotive was below build, and that takes us through a variety of good batter and different auto environment. So I just if you have any further color on sort of why that happened, because like I remember other times where things were tough, but your team found a way to your innovation or your activations or what have you. So what happened this time that was different? Lori Ryerkerk : So actually, Vincent, fourth quarter of '21, was exactly like this. We had the same issue. We were lower than builds because of destocking. And I think there's a number of things that happened. I mean people hit the end of the year. They want to make working capital numbers. So they destock at the end of the year, for a year in inventory control. Prices have been coming down because raws are down and natural gas was falling. So that made people more confident in pricing going forward. So they believe prices going forward are less than they are now. And so they choose to draw down their inventory in anticipation of lower prices. I think the supply chain issues have been largely resolved around the world. And so people are more confident about being able to buy material. So why we saw a lot of build of stock in 2022 because people were worried about getting resin. I think we see, going forward, people feel the supply chain issues are largely resolved. So, the dynamic is actually very similar at the end of 2022 as it was at the end of 2021. I would say a little bit what's different is usually the fourth quarter as a magnitude was a little bit -- was more in 2022, I'd say, primarily because of Asia. And usually in Asia, we have a pretty good fourth quarter in advance of Chinese New Year. But this year, because of the resurgence of COVID in Asia, things were quite slow in Asia in fourth quarter as well. And so, I'd say the dynamic was a little bit more pronounced this year. Obviously, Europe was even a little bit slower just on the malaise we've seen in Europe all year. But the dynamic was very similar. And I think the reason for destocking were very similar to what we saw at the end of '21. And again, January started slow. We've seen improvement here as we've gotten through the second half of February and order books are looking consistent with March 2022 order books for March of '23. So, we feel like we've gotten past these dynamics and now are on a more normal trajectory where we will meet or exceed, which is typically what we've done. You're right, we're very good at that. Our teams are very brave about pushing more volumes into the market and high margins. We feel like we're back on that trajectory as of March. Vincent Andrews : Okay, thank you for all the detail. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Mike Sison : Hi, good morning. If I did the math for '23 for adjusted EBIT for EM, it looks like you need to be between $12 and $13 and an acetyl chain, $13 to $14. But I guess my question is, if we think about where they could be longer term, maybe '25, '26, where do you think EM should be able to get to? And then if the $13 to $14 is the new foundational, what would the mid-cycle acetyl chain potential be couple years out? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, that's a lot of questions. I'll roll into one, Mike. Let me see if I can parse that apart. So if we look at '23, there's a lot of ways we can get to the $12 to $13, and there's a lot of things that could happen in terms of energy pricing and everything else. I would think of it as going forward, we -- including '23, we expect EM and acetyls to contribute roughly evenly for the next few years. This year, it might be a little stronger on acetyls than EM as we work through kind of the restoration of M&M based earnings and start to capture synergies. But I would say for the next several years, I would consider them roughly equal, because we also have the Clear Lake project coming on this year, which is going to add another $100 million to acetyls. We have VAM expansions and other things coming on. So I think that's a good starting place. If we look at a foundational level of earnings, what I would say is today, we think it's about $1 billion to $1.1 billion. That was before Tow, Tow is going to be at or above kind of the $2.50 that we called out at the time of the Investor Day in '21. So that kind of puts you in that $12.5 to $13.5 range, which is pretty consistent with the numbers you saw. But then again, we'll add million $100 million on a full year basis for Clear Lake. But that is, again, the foundational level of earnings. So we're still operating at very high-capacity utilization in acetyls, despite the softness, despite everything else, even in the fourth quarter, our utilization was 70% in China, but 90% global basis. That's still pretty high. And that's I think where we're going to see maybe a little more volatility in acetyls as the market is going to react more quickly to outages due to turnaround or unplanned outages or movements in raw material pricing. So, I can't really say what I think the mid-range is, but I would just say there's definitely - we've seen in acetyls, we can see a pretty sharp spike up in a very short period of time as the market reacts to short and medium-term changes. Mike Sison : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now live. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning Lori. Lori, obviously in the prepared remarks, a lot of commentary around destocking, restocking and the like, I was hoping you could give us some historical context as you look at your portfolio. In terms of destocking, historically, how long you have your destocking cycles lasted? What did the restock look like once the destocking was over and the like? I'm just trying to get some sort of perspective in terms of where inventory levels are right now, what the bounce back could look like and the like? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so I would say, historically, we've seen destocking last kind of a quarter, especially in EM, maybe a little bit less in acetyls because they don't have as much inventory. And I would say - I wouldn't even say we're necessarily seeing restocking at this point. I would say we're seeing a return to normal levels of demand. Typically, when we see restocking is when prices start to go up and people start getting worried that prices in the future are going to be higher than they are today. So they take the opportunity to build inventory in advance of an anticipated price increase. Again, as I said earlier, I think with where we are today, where raws are down, natural gas is low, the anticipation in the market is that prices are going to go lower or stay low. And so, I don't think we'll really see restocking until we see a turn up. But we do see a return to normal levels of demand starting now in March. Hassan Ahmed : Understood, understood. And as a follow-up, on the acetyl chain side, you guys talked about how pricing through the quarter was Chinese pricing at cost curve levels. Yet despite that, you guys, obviously, idled some facilities, yet you generated around 25%, 26% EBITDA margins. So I'm just trying to get a better sense of Celanese's cost curve positioning as it sits right now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so I think there's, a couple of components to that. I think, in China, specifically, while I believe throughout the end of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of the first quarter, we were at the cost curve in China in terms of the industry, our cost position is a bit better than that. And it has to do with the scale of our operations, the technology that we have and therefore, improved cost bases we have versus the vast majority of the producers in China. So, we continued even when the rest of the industry was at the cost curve to make even a small amount of margin in China. And then, of course, we're benefited by the fact that we have a very large facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast. So when we saw natural gas prices coming off in - towards the second half of the fourth quarter and as we've gone into the first quarter with low natural gas prices. That is a, big margin uplift for us versus people who are producing out of coal or even crude at these kind of prices, and that opens up windows for us to move material to Europe and other parts of the world out of the Gulf Coast. And so, I think it is that global optionality that we have, that global footprint as well as the optionality we have to move things up and down the chain that really allow us to continuously deliver high level of margins from what some might consider commodity business. It certainly does not give commodity returns. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now live. P.J. Juvekar: Yes hi, good morning Lori and Scott. Lori, do you have a long-term view on the competitiveness of your European assets? And what I mean by that is European VAM capacity was shutdown. Is that the marginal capacity that goes in and out with the market, like what Singapore plant used to do in acetic acid? Can you just take a step back and explain to us sort of the marginal capacity in Europe and your plans there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, no, thanks for the question, P.J. Look, maybe to clarify, so VAM going down in Frankfurt wasn't because VAM couldn't make money in Frankfurt. It was just we saw the demand go down so much towards the end of the year. I mean VAM demand in December was down -- in the fourth quarter was more than 50% off Q3. So we had a really huge demand destruction in the fourth quarter because of pricing, because of the weather, because of destocking, because of all of those things. And so -- but even at that, I mean, we could have run VAM profitably, it is not normally the most expensive VAM production in our network, but because of the high pricing we were seeing in Europe last year. It just made sense because the total capacity for the globe was down, it just made sense that we - shutdown that facility that was challenged due to energy pricing and move material from other lower cost energy locations. But we're starting it up now. I mean, the March order book for VAM in Europe is really the strongest we've seen in six months. So now we need IPH. And it makes sense, we're going to be about -- I think that the order book right now is about 85% is what we saw in the third quarter. So it makes sense to start a VAM. We have lower energy prices. So again, Frankfurt returns to not being the highest priced one. So again, this is the beauty of a global network. We have the optionality to take units down to skew where we make it based on what is most cost competitive at the time based on where the demand is at the time. And that just happened to be Frankfurt last year, but it could be something different in the next year. But that's why we like having all of this optionality around the globe. P.J. Juvekar: Great, thank you. And then on M&M, it seems like it was really under managed in the last one year of ownership. Do most of M&M's issues are residing more on nylon area? And can you upgrade the M&M portfolio? Because I think you had more EV exposure than them. And so is there a natural upgrade there? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so I would say if you look at the portfolio from M&M, certainly, nylon was the most challenged. I think elastomers was more robust then. And even within the nylon portfolio, high-temperature nylons and some others didn't see the impact. It was more, I would say, in Zytel and the PA66 line. And as we've called out before, I mean, there were many issues around decisions being made around pricing, both positive and negative, maintaining volume in standard grades and those sorts of things. And there were very high raw material costs and a take-or-pay contract that requires them to take us. So, I think there's just a lot that went into that underperformance in 2022. But the good news is these are things that are fixable. And this is what Tom and his team have been working very hard on in the last three months is moving the pricing, getting the inventory down in the fourth quarter, which certainly hurt us in the fourth quarter that will help us now as we go forward in 2023 and are able to sell lower cost basis inventory, more in line with pricing. So, I think the good news is going forward, this is all stuff that is fixable, and we are working rapidly to do so. Scott Richardson : Yes, the earnings power of this combined portfolio hasn't changed from when we announced the deal a year ago. If anything, I think it's - we're even more convicted around that going forward. There is, near-term challenges. And we've been, over the last several quarters, very clear about the disappointment and the performance. And it is requiring a big lift in the near term, but the long-term earnings power of these combined portfolios and combined with the acetyl chain, as you look out three to four years, is very substantial. Operator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now live. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Lori, can you elaborate on the 1.3 million ton expansion of acetyl capacity at Clear Lake. What are you baking into your numbers with regard to timing of the start-up and operating rate given the current market conditions? And then any thoughts on how you would see that earnings trajectory evolving through this year and into 2024 would be helpful? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so the project itself is going well. We are still anticipating an on-time, on-budget startup mid this year. So, we expect to have it running for, let's just call it, roughly half of the year. At the time we did the project, we called out while we have the ability to run 1.3 million tons additional, we really did it as a productivity project. So savings that we get from being able to move volumes directly to Europe, savings that we get from catalyst savings, energy savings, et cetera. So of that $100 million a year credit, we probably will only see about $25 million of that this year, because we have start-up costs, we have ramp-up time, all that sort of thing. So I'd expect to see about $25 million of that credit this year. And then next year, we should be at the full $100 million. Now having said that, to the extent that demand, deliver -- continues to grow robustly and energy prices continue to be so favorable on the Gulf Coast, it will make sense to try to run the unit for volume as well. What point that will be at? I couldn't say at this point. It's going to depend on demand and raw material and energy economics. But if that were to happen, that clearly is a higher return case for that project than we had with just the base productivity number that was baked in there. Kevin McCarthy : I see, that's helpful. And then secondly, if I may, a couple of financial questions for Scott, would you comment on your '23 capital expenditure budget? And with regard to the first quarter, what level of interest expense are you baking into your EPS guide? Scott Richardson : Yes. So capital, we still expect to be in kind of that $550 million to $600 million range. And that where we land there will really be dependent upon where we see the demand recovery as well as the outlook into the out years and as we continue to really put the combined EM and M&M portfolios together. And then from an interest expense standpoint, we're in that kind of 600 -- again, that $550 million to $600 million range for the year, and we'll have about quarter of that here in the first quarter. Kevin McCarthy : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question today is coming from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now live. Frank Mitsch : Hi, good morning, and congrats, Mark Murray, if you're listening. Lori, I wanted to ask about the level of auto builds that you have embedded in the guide for the year and where you think Celanese can perform relative to that level of industry auto builds? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, so we're assuming our 2023 forecast is basically assumes flat in '23 to the second half of 2022. So that's kind of like at an $85 million range, which really aligns pretty well with the IHS outlook this year, which they're forecasting an increase of 3.6%. That is almost exactly the same number. And that really is assuming U.S. and Europe, about 5% up; Asia, up about 2%, with China being the weakest point at 1%. Still I would say we're still about 5% lower than 2019. But we do believe that, that we're pretty consistent with IHS in this. We believe auto builds are going to be constrained by chip availability, not by demand. We think the pent-up demand is still there. And so to the extent chips would be more available, I think autos will build - other years as we've seen sometimes they're not as available and - but we're assuming kind of flat to second half 2022. I would say our - we would expect our contribution ourselves into auto to be maybe a couple of percent above that. And that's based upon a few things. One is the locations where we're stronger. So historically, we've been stronger in the U.S. and EU. Now with M&M, they've always been a bit stronger in Asia. But even having said that, I think we think we'd be a few percent above that. The other thing is the presence that we have in electric vehicles. I mean, we - over 10% of our sales by volume go into electric vehicles from the Heritage EM portfolio. And we continue to see that EVs are growing at a faster rate than ICE if you look at the forecast going forward so based on that, I would assume a couple of percent kind of low single-digit percent that we would expect to be over the build rate in terms of our auto growth. Frank Mitsch : Got you, thank you. And I know -- maybe a question for Scott. I know that the comment was the M&M inventory levels were really high and elevated given the take-or-pay contracts ended the year at $2.8 billion in terms of your inventories. How should we think about that -- the impact of maybe inventory reduction on working capital in '23? Scott Richardson : Yes as I said earlier, Frank, on the free cash flow question, we'd like to see at least a $200 million reduction, which will largely come out of inventory as we work through the year. I mean, that's going to largely be dependent on a few things : one, being able to bring absolute volumes down; two, depending on what were to transpire with raw materials. And I think with energy and gas already coming down, that will give us some wind at our back. But we really would like to see the volumetric reduction kind of contribute to that $200 million in total and then any pricing reduction be on top of that. So we're kind of hoping and planning for that $200 million reduction right now. Frank Mitsch : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from Matthew DeYoe from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Matthew DeYoe : Good morning, everyone. I know you adjusted term loan covenants, but do you still have to hit the 3x net debt to EBITDA by year-end 2024 that was stipulated by the rating agencies? And look, can I just use consensus EBITDA and hand up for well be wrong, But like you gave yourself some cumulative cash flow generation, which over the next two years, but that consensus EBITDA puts you like 3.5, 3.3. So is there a concern internally about this? And do you start thinking about other asset sales? Is that necessary? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I don't think there is a concern internally. As we've said since the time we did the deal, I mean, there are always levers that we can do. I mean from an asset sale standpoint, again, we don't feel we're in a position we have to do an asset sale. I mean we did food ingredients because we have the right partner with the structure we wanted that would give us both benefits and allow us both to participate in the growth in that business. And so the timing was right to do that. And I would say we will continue to be opportunistic with our businesses, both our legacy businesses as well as our acquired businesses. If and when we have the right buyer at what we think is a fair price, of course, we would consider it. But we believe that although this year has started slow, the recovery we expect to see this year, our ability to generate cash from working capital and others that we will be able to meet the expectations of the rating agencies this year as well as next year and into the future. Scott? Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean, look, we viewed this as a near-term challenge that required a near-term solution, and that was to amend the covenants. We're still pushing to get to that 3x levered at the end of 2024. And it really starts with, as Lori talked about, generating cash. Generating cash to pay down debt, lower that interest cost. I talked about the M&M incremental interest of $550 million to $600 million. We have legacy interest of $60 million to $70 million, lower that by paying down debt. And then also find ways at which to lower that interest cost through redomiciling some of that debt as we talked about earlier on the call. So it is really just about systematically bringing the debt down through cash generation. Matthew DeYoe : Okay. I know I appreciate that. And then on the VAM and EVA side. So I know acetic acid is pretty stable from a supply perspective outside of yourself and what you're doing. But it sounds a call for like decent VAM and EVA capacity growth over the next two years. Does that impact your spreads? I know demand growth there has been pretty good. Does that get absorbed? How do we think about that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So if you look at what's happening, there are some builds going on. So acetic acid, we do expect one start-up in 2023, late 2023. In China, we're also expecting a few VAM start-ups between '23 and '24. But if you look at the typical growth that we see for the acetyl chain, we need a full plan kind of every other year. So I don't think the rate of growth that we're seeing is inconsistent with the growth in the world. We are still at fairly high utilization. Again, I think the fact that we are at high utilizations will keep the volatility a bit more. So we'll do as we saw in fourth quarter, you may -- during periods of low demand and seasonality, go to the cost curve, but that can recover quite quickly. But I don't see it having a major impact on our margins going forward on kind of a long-term or full year basis. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. David Begleiter : Thank you. Lori, in the comments, you mentioned some destocking in the Americas in paints and coatings and construction applications. Can you give a little more color on what you're seeing there and where we are in that process? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I -- look we typically see seasonality because, obviously, when it's cold and snowy and things people aren't painting outside. And so that's typical. I would say also this year because we're coming off a period of high pricing for many of these materials because of the higher raws and the higher energy we saw during 2022. I think people took the opportunity much like we did in EM, for example, to draw down some of their inventories through the end of the year and get rid of higher cost inventory to make room for lower cost inventory going forward with anticipation of lower energy and raw material costs and pricing. So I think that's really the dynamic that we saw this year. Again, in the U.S., we haven't really seen the pickup yet as we have, say, in Europe, but I think it will come. There's no kind of structural reason that we think paints, coatings and construction is going to be off in 2023 versus 2022. David Begleiter : Understood. And just in acetyls, you referenced a $60 million earnings increase versus the last trough. Can you try to bridge that gap, what's improved in your operations? Because you've always been a good operator in this business, but you seem to have taking a step up since the last couple of years as well. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think it's a number of things. We've continued to invest in our acetyl assets, both foundationally, so investing in reliability and quality, energy savings, productivity. So we've continue to improve our cost basis. From that, we've improved our contracts in many of our areas for raw materials for the acetyl chain. I think that's probably the primary improvement we've seen in our sales over the last few years. The operating model we use in acetyls taking advantage of that end-to-end as well as geographic optionality is really strong. It's running really well. But I would say it's really the improvement in productivity, the improvement in contracting, as well as some of the minor kind of capacity adds, that capacity creep that we've had across our facilities, which gives us additional optionality and the addition of Elotex, which gives us further optionality down into the chain, which is especially helpful as we move into these kind of slower winter months. Scott Richardson : Kevin, we'll take one more question, please. Operator : Certainly. Our final question today is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Your line is now live. Jaideep Pandya : Hi, thanks a lot for taking my question. Just basically wanted to understand in the context of capacity shutdowns in the upstream side in nylon chain. How do you see yourself with regards to positioning in the value chain? Is this fundamentally more positive for you? Or is it fundamentally more negative for you in this context? Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Well, prior to the acquisition of M&M, obviously, we were a big buyer of nylon and would have been unhappy to see shutdowns in the upstream because that would lower price. But now that we both polymerize as well as compound nylon, I would say, generally, I would consider this a help for us as it tightens up the amount of nylon being produced and should raise value across the chain. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for calling in today. As always, we're around if you have any follow-up questions. Kevin, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Certainly. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Darryl. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its first quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both the press release and prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Since we published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll go ahead and ask you, Darryl to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Michael Leithead : First question, Lori, just high level on the full year EPS guide. You're doing about 450 of EPS in the first half, which implies about $7 in the second half. I assume synergies, Clear Lake, a few other things are helping in that back half. So I guess, is there a way to broadly characterize what you're assuming for market demand recovery in the second half versus, say, controllable actions? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. I mean you're right. We need about on average $1 lift in Q3 and Q4 from where we were in the first half. And so our focus really is on controllable actions to the extent we can. I mean, M&M volume recovery we saw about a 10% lift from Q4 to Q1, a similar lift from Q1 to Q2. We continue to expect volume recovery in the M&M business as well. Productivity, which is coming in at the top of our range for all of our businesses, M&M price optimization, synergies, which we'll see building across the quarter. We also do expect some improving demand again for in its entirety. We were up about 10% in the first quarter. We'll have some increase again in Q2, but we do expect things to get better still in the back half of the year. As we see kind of the EU and Asia competitive dynamic improving and see the in destocking in the U.S. And then we should have some tailwinds from raw materials and energy cost moderation, which should help with margins in all of our businesses and especially in EM as we see those costs flow through to inventory. And start to hit the P&L. So I think that's kind of what we're in control of. In terms of where we see the markets going, if we take it first by region, in China, we do expect modest demand improvement in Q2 and into the second half. We do see markets recovering in China, especially auto. And we continue to see some improvement in utilization in acetyls and hopefully get acetyls coming off the cost curve. Especially now as we're going into some turnarounds in Asia, we do see some upward price movement and some margin expansion in acetyls.  In Europe, we do expect continued modest demand improvement as well. We saw that through Q2. We expect that to continue at a slow pace into the second half. And then as I said, we would expect, as Asia proves we see less imports from Asia into Europe which should help margins in Europe get back to a better level. And in the U.S., again, we know a lot of people are calling out recession. We're not seeing that in our order book. I mean however you want to define recession. What we're continuing to see is general recovery across a lot of markets. We still had some destocking in Q2, but we expect that destocking to be mostly over as we go into the second half of the year. And so if you look at end markets, auto has continued to be quite resilient in the EM portfolio that's helping both our legacy businesses as well as our M&M businesses. 2023 auto builds, we still expect to be up 3% to 4% of 2022, and we're at a run rate right now that already achieved that. And we are seeing our own auto volume recovery at a pace significantly better than that. And really building on the project pipeline and all the work that's been done in the last several years to build that pipeline, both for the transition to EV as well as increasing our content per vehicle we see auto being a fairly robust end market for us this year even with just a moderate growth in the actual build themselves.  I would say the most sluggish sector we still see and is baked into our forward look is construction. Although we see some modest improvements in Europe and Asia and Europe, mostly on the renovation market as energy efficiency regulations come into effect. We still see it could be quite slow in the U.S. and in China, where we've not seen any recovery in really commercial construction yet at this time. And then non- auto -- the other non-auto durables, I would say, electronics, electrification is improving. There's a lot of need for more electrification around the world, and so we see that as a growing market this year. But in consumer electronics and consumer -- other consumer appliances, we see that lagging 2022, especially in the U.S. And then finally, packaging, we do see resilient growth in packaging, especially in the U.S. I think about Amazon and everything that's getting shipped from online shopping. And also the push for sustainable packaging solutions, but paints and coatings is a bit slow tied to construction. So that's probably a bit more than you will before, Mike, but that's a little bit of a summary of kind of where we see things going in the second half and the underlying trends that support our confidence in that $11 to $12 range that we put out for the year. Michael Leithead : Great. That's super helpful. And then maybe second, you talked in the prepared commentary, Lori, a bit about some of the integration actions you're taking in nylon 66 I was just hoping you could expand a bit about how you're currently thinking about your approach to the 66 value chain and just maybe how Celanese going forward might be operating differently than, say, M&M stand-alone nylon polymerization business or just even the legacy Celanese compounding business there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So let me talk a little bit about 66 in general, starting with what we're doing immediately around 66. So in the past, Celanese has not been backward integrated in 66. So we were just a purchaser of nylon Polymer, which was great when prices are low, not so great when prices are high. With DuPont, we've been able to add the backward integration. What we're doing differently is we've been able to secure a different raw material contract and instead of being forced to produce PA66 polymer we have options. We have flexibility. We have optionality. We can choose to produce backward integrated nylon polymer when it makes sense, we can make less and buy nylon polymers, from others, if that makes more sense, we can make less of it if we see the demand profile not supporting higher production rates, and we can make more of it if we see a sudden resurgence of demand. And so that flexibility, which is much more like we run our other businesses like GUR and Palm and even acetyl, gives us a degree of flexibility and ability to make value across a wide range of market conditions that DuPont really didn't have or really didn't exercise. And so we've already done that. We've gotten most of the Celanese nylon grade already certified to start with the DuPont polymer.  We've been using DuPont polymer out of inventory, raw home, compounding it to make the Celanese branded products and we've been flexing that to really start managing some of the inventories that had been built last year for both raw and for finished polymers in the DuPont product line. And so that's a degree of flexibility and a way of running the business, which is different. We've also talked about how we're pricing differently pushing price on more differentiated grade lowering prices in some case and more standard grades to really get our inventory in line with the demand profile. And therefore, the cost profile of our inventory in line with the demand profile. So that's kind of the immediate things we're doing. As we think about PA66 longer term, of course, we spent a lot of time studying this before we went into this deal. We know a lot of people are like, well, PA66 is under hood, that's going to decline. We don't see it that way. I mean if we look at electric vehicles as they're coming on the market, we find that the addressable content per vehicle is almost double compared to what we've traditionally have in IPE. And we think a lot of those new opportunities in electric vehicles also extends to PA66 as we see performance requirements increasing for electric vehicles. So longer battery life, higher heat management required. These things are very suited to PA66.  So if you think about parts, the PA66 is suited for an EV, things where you replace metal for lightweighting when you need the strength of a PA66, things like battery cell frames and in place. The brackets and the mounts for the electric motors and then things in the electrical system like high-voltage connectors, and it's the PA66, standard grades, but also the high temperature and [indiscernible] grades, which are particularly applicable here and which we didn't have in our portfolio prior to the acquisition of M&M. And I would say for our legacy EM business, we're about halfway to capturing the addressable content for EVs. Obviously, the M&M business was not as focused there. And so not as far as long, but we are using our project pipeline to also drive these applications of PA66 into EVs now that we have those molecules available to us. And I think if you think about PA66 beyond electric vehicles, there are huge applications there in electrical and electronics which was an area that M&M was really underrepresented in historically. So think about electrification and the need for not just electrification per vehicle, but for everything you think about people wanting to get out of natural gas for homes, but basically, the electrification of everything. All the outlets would say electrification, electricity demand is going to more than double in the next 5 years.  So with that comes data management centers, power distribution centers. All of these things require polymer and specifically, all of them can benefit from the availability of PA66. And so we think there's going to be a strong pull-through for PA66 as the demand grows for building out our electrical infrastructure. And again, this is an area Celanese has been in for some years, and now we're able to apply that market knowledge and that end use knowledge to the PA66 profile and pull those volumes through using the project pipeline model. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : I think you reduced your earnings per share goal by dollar. What was the source of a decrease? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If we look at the first half, our first half came in about where we -- in total, where we expected the first half to come in with 1Q being up because of some unanticipated commercial opportunities for spot market volumes as well as some pull forward from the second quarter, especially in auto, a few parts for auto and a few for medical implants. And so since we don't expect those -- we're not counting on those unexpected opportunities reoccurring in the second quarter. Second quarter has been a little bit lower. And we are seeing the demand in the second quarter not build as quickly as we had thought at this time last quarter. And so that reduction to $11 to $12 really reflects that slower demand growth that we're seeing across second quarter going into third quarter and just accounting for that in our outlook for the second half. Jeff Zekauskas : Is it fair to say that as a base case, second quarter volumes and prices are flat sequentially? Lori Ryerkerk : I expect for volume for Engineered Materials. We should see the volumes increasing moderately across the second half, especially in M&M as we have market share recovery and just base business demand increasing in automotive and some of the other end applications. I think for acetyls, we also expect moderate growth into the second quarter as we start to see more recovery in the end markets. right now for acetyl, pricing is a little -- is challenged, although we are seeing some early green shoots on China asset pricing and margin expansion, it's very new, though. So although we've baked what we've seen so far into our projections, we think there's still some more room there, possible upside there. And I think for Engineered Materials, we do expect some margin expansion as we go to the second half particularly as we see the lower raws and energy costs from the first half pulling through the volume and inventory, which will help with margin expansion in the second half. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lori, maybe you could just give us a bit more color on the demand spike that you saw in March, maybe stepping back. Is there any -- was there any sort of theme in particular that you can hone in on any region in particular that saw that increase? And as you kind of step back, was it more so of a pull-forward from 2Q that benefited March, do you think. Lori Ryerkerk : Let me talk about that a little bit. So as we saw in March, what we saw in March is we saw our books starting to really -- at the time of the call, we were really seeing good volume showing up on our books for in our base businesses, and that gave us some confidence about second quarter. I think the unanticipated commercial opportunities that we saw, though, at the end of March, which really got us above our guidance was a number of things. One, there were some unusually high spot demand at the end of the quarter. So things like Palm and nylon, also to an RDP, so it was across both of our businesses. And I think because of our flexibility we have in our supply chain and our operations, we were able to capture a significant share of that unexpected volume that arose at the end of the quarter.  I would say that was the majority of that. I think though we also did see accelerated by in a few products in auto and in medical implants, which is a little unusual because we had expected quite a big headwind from medical implants and in fact, had some orders come in. In the case of medical, I think that probably pulled forward from Q2. In auto, we think it's also some pull forward from Q2 in anticipation of better demand in Q2. So I think on that one, is it pull forward? Or is it just quicker demand recovery? Not sure yet. That's not clear. But we're kind of characterizing it as pull forward until we see if that's a sustainable trend. Ghansham Panjabi : Got it. And then as it relates to the U.S. and your comments on destocking, just a bit more color there in terms of which particular end markets I assume construction is part of that. But just to hear your thoughts. And then just judging by destocking that's occurred in other geographies, including in Europe, what do you think is a reasonable time line in terms of the destocking event? Is it 2 quarters, 3 quarters? How are you thinking about it now? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. What I would say, is we really saw the end of destocking in Europe and Asia for the most part as we moved into the second quarter. What we've really seen destocking continue is in the U.S. And there, auto is pretty robust, I would say, across all of the areas. But I think there, we see destocking continuing in consumer goods and industrial for the most part. And right now, our projection is we think that's going to continue through second quarter, but be pretty much over as we move into the third quarter, and that's some of the uplift we expect to see in the second half. Operator : Our next question has come from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Lori or maybe Scott, you started the first quarter with negative free cash flow. Can you help us walk into the 1.4? You maintain free cash of 1.4. How does that sort of unfold, do we turn positive in 2Q? Or is it more second half loaded? Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean we expect it to be negative just kind of coming off of where Q4 was from a sales perspective and then kind of when we had the interest payment. So as we walk into the second quarter, you've got higher levels of earnings coming through. We also had really abnormally high CapEx from a cash perspective in the quarter as well as cash taxes being higher. That goes away at a higher level. We're at more normalized levels in the balance of the year. With the higher earnings levels coming through now in the balance part of the year, we would expect to be able to kind of get up and average much higher levels as we go forward. That sequential walk from Q1 into Q2 is about a $700 million lift from where we were in the first quarter when you kind of put all those things together. Michael Sison : Got it. Okay. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you said that 50% of the first quarter EPS came in March. So April is at a buck -I'm sorry, March is at back then if you think about April, May, June, it typically is better than March, I think. So what happened, do you think in terms of decelerate -- the deceleration into April, May and June, and I thought maybe that dollar could have sustained throughout the quarter. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Again, Mike, I would say a significant portion -- or a portion, I should say, of that dollar in March really was related to the unanticipated and spot like opportunities we were able to capture in March. And so we've not seen those repeat in April, and we haven't baked them in as repeating later in the quarter. Whereas the base level of earnings has continued to grow -- will continue to grow moderately across the months. So I think we're just trying to be realistic in terms of what we think is repeatable and what was fortunate. Again, we're positioned to take advantage of those spot opportunities if they were to arise again, but we don't want to bake that into our forecast. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Matthew DeYoe : So it looks like you beat your 1Q M&M EBITDA guidance and 2Q is expected to accelerate. But the prepared comments no longer mentioned that lift to like $700 million to $750 million in EBITDA. Are you walking away from that level what do you kind of expect M&M can deliver this year for EBITDA? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Matt. We're really happy with how the integration is going and the value uplift we're starting to see in the M&M assets. Our concern at this point is the fact that second quarter is not accelerating at the pace that we thought across all of our businesses. And so we're going into the second half. At a little lower demand rate than we had originally called out last quarter. So that applies to M&M as well. And so what we're really focused on now, so what I would say is, if that plays out the way we see now, I would say we're kind of at the lower end of that $700 million to $750 million that we called out. And so what we're really trying to get our teams to focus on is making sure we're delivering growth. So that as we get towards the end of the year, we are basically on track for EPS neutral quarter going into 2020, either sometime in the second half or going into 2023, which would be at that kind of $200 million EBITDA range, including synergy. Matthew DeYoe : And can you talk a little bit more about the product flow out of China and PLM into Europe? PLM is not really a product, I have a ton of line of sight into. So maybe kind of give me an idea of where margins are in Europe now versus China or what the theoretical kind of compression risk looks like to the European business, how far along we are and maybe some of that are closing from European product or a Chinese product? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. really started back in the fourth quarter and when we really started seeing -- or really even through the third quarter last year when we really started seeing the very high energy prices in Europe. That raise the price of palm in Europe and provided an arbitrage opportunity for Palm coming out of Asia, both China and Korea out of Asia into Europe because demand was very low in Europe. And so that -- those molecules found a home in Europe, where it could be highly competitive even with the shipping cost to do the -- to be there. Now obviously, with the COVID resurgence in December, and going into the first quarter, we saw those volumes still flowing in the first quarter, even as we started to see energy prices coming down, in Europe, but because of the lack of demand in Asia, there was still an opportunity to move projects into Europe. And while we still see volumes moving in the second quarter, we really expect that now demand is coming back up in Asia that those molecules will find a home again in Asia, prices are down and competitive in Europe. With that on a landed basis. And so we should see those prices stabilizing again in Europe, I think as we move through this quarter and into the third quarter. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : Two questions, maybe I'll roll into. One here is you seem to pull a lot of levers to basically keep free cash flow in the range that you provided, despite the cut to earnings. Just curious, one, what levers are left if things will play out as you see it and two, as you look at your guidance, I mean, you're talking about demand improving. I guess does the lower end of your range reflect the scenario where demand doesn't really improve from 2Q levels? Or would that be another cut that we need to consider? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Let me start with your kind of last question first. I think the lower end is a range that we feel is achievable even with only really moderate growth. And there are some areas we know like auto, we feel quite comfortable we'll continue to grow this year at a very moderate pace because of the pent-up demand for auto. So I would say the -- we feel very confident in the $11, short of a global recession, on the $11 end of our outlook and our cash flow reflects that. But I mean, if we were to say, go into a global recession, we have a really unexpected downturn here well beyond anything that any of us are imagining right now. There are still levers within cash flow, and we saw that in 2020 with COVID.  So if we really see that kind of scenario develop our demand goes down. One, we'll have more working capital release because the value of inventory goes down, we'll be able to go down to even more minimum inventories. But we would also have cost savings as we would take steps similar to what we did during COVID to slow production rates possibly even shut down plants for a period of time, and you have cost saving benefits that come from that. So I mean, I think we feel very comfortable in our ability to deliver the level of cash flow that we've indicated given the steps that we've already called out Josh Spector : Okay. And just a quick follow-up just on the inventory adjustment in 2Q, kind of thinking along against similar scenarios here, is that something contained within 2Q? Or is that something that drags into the second half is what's baked into the outlook there? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we're assuming any working capital release from inventory of $300 million or more. So if you think about 2Q, that's a $100 million reduction in working capital and that comes with 30 to 35 impact on EBITDA -- EBIT. So as we go forward, you would expect to see that same impact continue through the second half as we take other inventory adjustments. Obviously, different inventory adjustments come at a different EBIT and depending on what pricing is doing, but I would expect to see some impact from inventory as we move through the year. Scott Richardson : Yes. And Josh and that's all baked into the guide that we gave. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Lori, would you elaborate on your acetyl outlook in China? If we look at some of the consultant assessments of acetic acid prices they really haven't done a whole lot over the last 2 months or so. But in listening to your commentary, it sounds like maybe there's some upward tension building there. If that's correct, would you attribute that to some of your competitors' outages over the next month or 2? Or do you foresee a more sustained cyclical uplift as the year plays out. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. So as tills in fourth quarter was definitely sub foundational, and I think we talked about that. I mean we're really essentially at the cost curve and in some periods of time during the quarter and fourth quarter and even into first quarter, even below the cost curve from time to time. So what's happened is if you look at coal pricing in China, coal pricing, why asset pricing has remained at about the same level for the last several months. We've actually seen coal pricing come down from Q4 to Q1, coal pricing came down about 20%. And so you see some uplift in the actual margin. So now we're still very close to the cost curve in terms of margins, but it stabilized a little bit through first quarter. And then some of the turnarounds, which we expected to happen in the first quarter got pushed to second quarter. We're starting to see those turnarounds start. And as that takes capacity out of the system, that further tightens the [flight-fly] demand situation we see margins slowly creeping up. And just really in the last 5 days, we've started to see a slow increase in acetic acid pricing which we baked that into our guidance, that small increase that we've seen. But I'd say it's still early. We need to see if that's sustained. But we think there is a chance that is sustained with now the more normal level of outages we expect going forward. I mean the last 6 months have been remarkably stable in the acetic acid world. I mean not a lot of unplanned downtime, not a lot of increases in demand, not a lot of planned downtime. And I think we're going into a more typical period now where we will have occasional outages, both planned and unplanned, which will give us periods of market tightness that we'll be able to take advantage of. Kevin McCarthy : And then secondly, for Scott, can you speak to your debt reduction target for this year? You affirmed your free cash flow or at least endorsed free cash flow 1.4 billion. I think that number excludes the proceeds that you expect from your Mitsui deal which I understand to be $400 million or more. And so can you put that into context in terms of how you can attack the balance sheet over the next 8 or 9 months here? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks. Kevin. If you go back, we had stated a goal of reducing net debt by $1 billion in 2023. With the cash flow that we expect, we'll certainly do that. And when you layer in the Mitsui proceeds on top of that, certainly, will well exceed that net debt reduction target that we had when we first announced the deal a year ago, of $1 billion. So we feel good about where we finished the year from a net debt perspective. And then given what Lori talked about earlier on where we would expect from an earnings trajectory to exit the year as we drive cleanup of the inventory on the balance sheet and we start expensing much lower cost inventory as we go into the second half and then exit the year, we feel good about the earnings trajectory to get to that 3x target that we had initially stated by the end of 2020. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Babesh] for John. I would like to hear your thoughts on the competitive landscape in Europe between your businesses. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned some price concessions you offer there in Yen. Any changes to your competitors or perhaps a change in the product mix that is happening there? And then on asset deals, all your competitors have the level of flexibility you mentioned of moving products from Asia. So assuming things are not as easy as you for your competitors, any changes in market share or capacity there. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. In terms of the competitive landscape in Europe, I think the real challenge there has been imports from Asia, again, reflecting the low demand in Asia and the improved cost position Asia had compared to Europe when they had much higher energy prices. And I should say Europe energy prices have come down significantly, but they are still high relative to the rest of the world. And so again, we see that situation improving, especially now with increased demand developing in Europe. We really see that having improved now at the end of the first quarter going into the second quarter and then further improving in the second half of the year.  On Steel's competitiveness, it has been a very stable market. So it's been very competitive as there's -- and it's also been a period of seasonably low demand for acetyls as well as some of the impacts of China holidays and just lower China demand and the slowdown in the construction industry globally and the impact that has on acetyls. Again, as we start to see recovery, even slight recovery in Europe and Asia in construction, as we start the normal levels of shutdown, we do see an opportunity there to capture additional margin in the acetyl space. the ability to capture additional market share is really based upon our commercial model and the optionality and flexibility we have to take advantage of when there are spot opportunities by moving molecules around the globe by flexing up and down our product chain. In first quarter, we took advantage of the stronger markets for emulsions and RDP further down the chain, which helped boost our profitability in the first quarter. As we start to see some movement in the asset price in China, there will be an opportunity to take advantage of it there. So it really is all around more so than market share, it's more around the flexibility and optionality and the ability to capture in any given market at any given time, any upside potential that exists. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And secondly, on clean, congrats on the commissioning there. You mentioned $100 million worth earnings contribution next year. Is this all incremental to your overall global earnings level -- or will some of it be offset by, say, reduced operating rates somewhere products in China where you're running close to your cost curve? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So the $100 million is on top of our already kind of $1.3 billion level of foundational earnings for Acetyl so that's raising the total global acetyl Foundational earnings from to 1.4. And think about it, it's really about 50% based on what I call ratable productivity, so things like reduce catalyst costs, reduce energy costs, reduce maintenance costs, et cetera. And then about 50% of it is based on having kind of built-in turnaround and outage coverage in the network by having 2 units at Clear Lake. And then obviously, there's additional upside to that if we were to get in a period of higher demand and higher pricing to basically raise our output from -- in totality of our acetyl chain. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : Yes. Congratulations on the mechanical completion for the Clear Lake acetic acid facility. I know you gave some earnings projections for the balance of the year and for next year. I was just curious as to how this is going to impact your operating rates at some of your other facilities. How should we think about the industry overall and the impact that this may have. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So thanks, Frank. We are happy to have the mechanical completion behind us, and we're moving now into the commissioning phase and anticipate production in Q3. Look, at the lower natural gas prices we're seeing, which greatly advantages our location there in Clear Lake. I would anticipate you would see that facility running at higher rates, which could reduce rates because of global demand. Reduce our operating rates in China and Singapore as we continue to supply Europe from the U.S., and we'll be able to supply Europe even at higher volumes entirely now coming out of the U.S., and it's cost effective to do so.  I don't know that you really see opportunistic shipments to Asia. Although that's possible in the second half, the volume of that, though, is limited. I mean, there are other supply constraints around availability of vessels and availability of receiving tankage, et cetera. But that arbitrage could open up as well. I think what we need to realize is Clear Lake is not only the lowest cost producer of acetic acid now in the world. And we'll be able to produce a significant volume of it, but it is also the lowest carbon footprint producer of acetic acid in the world. And so we think that is going to bring -- open up a lot of opportunities for Clear Lake and from the impact on the industry, clearly, I think it will make some impact in terms of volumes you see moving from Asia to Europe as we'll be able to service volumes in Europe much more cheaply from the U.S. Frank Mitsch : So the intent would be to run that flat out and ramp back some of the operating -- ramp up some of your other facilities. Where do you think operating rates are in acetic acid as we look at the second quarter. And then, of course, you guys recently restarted your non-Zing VAM facility. If you could talk about operating rates in the VAM area as well, that would be helpful. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, industry operating rates for both globally for both aceic acid and VAM are still kind of in that 90% range. maybe from time to time a bit lower, but are still kind of trending towards that 90% range. It just has been so stable, which is a little bit unusual in this business. For the last 6 months that people have gotten comfortable at those operating levels and demand has been down, again, normal seasonality. And so it feels quite comfortable. But at 90%, I mean, we are now positioned to take advantage of really any -- either planned or unplanned downtime that occur globally in either asset or BAM or any of the downstream derivatives. And that's really where we've seen the opportunity in the past is when we start getting some either regional or short-term misallocation between supply and demand Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : I wanted to follow up on that a little bit on the demand side of the equation because one of the issues I\u2019ve been having in our own S&D models here is trying to sort of reconcile what I think the underlying demand number is versus what shipments have been to try to account for. Obviously, we had a lot of issues with unplanned outages over the last few years, but we also had very strong building and construction demand in the acetyl chain. So how do you reconcile that when you sit here today and think about what the actual underlying instant demand is versus shipments and maybe how much shipments might have overstated demand in the past and maybe understating demand now in terms of thinking through what operating rates can look like over the next couple of years. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, it\u2019s been a bit of a confusing time and Frank, I would say. If we look at fourth quarter last year, when prices were very low, we started seeing demand really coming off, particularly in Asia, although operations were fairly stable, we certainly still saw some molecules moving as people anticipated different things. And as we go forward, we also saw a lot of shipment and people carrying higher inventories before that because of all of the supply chain issues that existed around the world, and you call like in the first half of 2022. VAM and emulsions, I mean, there just wasn\u2019t even enough molecules out there to meet the customer demand. And so people were carrying a lot higher inventories when we saw the reduction in demand through the fourth quarter, we saw people really destocking in the fourth quarter. We called that out at the last earnings call.  I would say now as we\u2019ve moved through the first quarter and especially March and beyond, we do see demand recovery coming back for fibers for other end users. Construction is still, I\u2019d say, the weak spot, although even in \u2013 like in Asia, we\u2019re seeing a little bit of recovery in construction. And in Europe, we\u2019re seeing recovery in construction, not so much in new builds, but in renovation for energy efficiency, where a lot of our downstream derivatives products go. So we are seeing the demand coming back again with a few exceptions. And so that is starting to bring the volumes up. But we\u2019re not really seeing restocking occurring yet as people feel fairly comfortable because we\u2019ve been in such a stable period and haven\u2019t had the supply chain issues. I think customers feel fairly confident they can get the materials they want. As we see demand continue to increase, I expect we\u2019ll see some level of restocking. And with that higher demand, we should see some tightening of pricing and seeing some pricing uplift across all the regions. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess the first thing was you noted about $1 of uplift from 2Q into 3Q and 4Q. Would that be split kind of evenly between the 2 -- I mean, the $2 be split evenly, so you're looking at 3Q, 4Q about equivalently? Or is 3Q typically seasonally higher and then relatedly, how much of that dollar uplift, I guess, is under your control? I know you feel very comfortable with the $11 level for the full year. But maybe if you could just walk through maybe the walk from 250 to 350, say how much would be coming from M&M synergies and how much will be coming from volume and how much would be coming from internal cost reductions or something like that, that would be helpful. Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. So I would say -- let me again start with the end probably of that dollar uplift, the $0.75 is the bottom end of the range, which would get us kind of to the $11. We feel very much that's in our control. That's within our ability to see. I mean, again, assuming markets develop moderately in the way that we're calling out now. Combined with the controllable actions, combined with what we've seen with raw materials and energy, those things all continue as we've called out, then we clearly have a line of sight to that $11. To get to the upper end of the range, which would be more like 375 a quarter would require some further demand improvement across the end markets. And so you're right. Usually, in terms of timing, usually Q3 is a bit higher than Q4. I think we don't really have a lot of visibility on that yet. But I would say, I actually wouldn't expect them to be that much different this year. Although we typically get seasonality in Q4. That seasonality is in the Western Hemisphere. Now with the acquisition, we have much more exposure in Asia, which tends to be very strong in Q4. So I would expect for Engineered Materials, for example, that those would be similar levels in Q3 and Q4. And in fact, if we're in recovery, we've had some very healthy Q4 before when we've been in recovery as well as we have synergies building throughout the years so that our highest number for synergy will be in Q4. So I -- right now, I would say I would expect Q3 and Q4 to be similar, although typically, Q3 has been a higher quarter than Q4. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And then just as a follow-up, you're going to be exiting the year theoretically at around $7 a second half level of earnings. So next year, and still, that would be maybe reflective of just a modest demand environment. So would you expect kind of continued growth as you look into '24 and similar to that second half and growing from there, is that a fair starting point? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think that's a fair starting point. I mean, obviously, we'll have some quarter-to-quarter variation because of seasonality and other things. But assuming a steady demand environment, will continue to get additional benefits from M&M. We've historically grown our own Engineered Materials business in kind of a double-digit range year-on-year. And we will get the further benefits from having Clear Lake online as well as some of the other expansions, including the integration of tow into acetyls which will continue to grow on a year-on-year basis as we move forward. So I think that's not an unreasonable place to start when you're thinking about 2024. Operator : Come from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : A question around some of the guided to sort of self-help sort of measures to boost EBITDA. I mean earlier, you were talking about being able to attain around $130 million in 2023 worth of M&M synergies as well as slightly north of $140 million from the business overall. So how is that tracking? Are those numbers still sort of attainable, beatable? Where do we stand with that? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So we had called out before 100 to 135 of M&M synergies. We fully expect to be at the top end of that range. So we are on track for that. In the second quarter, we had about $10 million of synergies from M&M. There's another $10 million or $20 million that will be added to that in the second quarter and continue to build through the year. So we feel very comfortable in achieving that $135 million of M&M synergies this year. We feel very comfortable that we have achieved the uplift from to was very obvious in the first quarter, and we also got an additional 10 million to 20 million of uplift in the first quarter from to spot sales, which was part of our model going forward that we wanted to be able. Those will be there every quarter, but I think it shows the value of having integrated it into acetyls and running it in a different way. It gives us more options to capture upside than we've had in the past. So I feel very comfortable with that number on to. I think the other thing is productivity. So we've historically achieved $100 million to $150 million a year of gross productivity. Through the first quarter, we are on track to achieve at or above that top end of that range on productivity. And these are business productivity separate from M&M synergies. So I think when we talk about self-help, we feel like we're really delivering on all of these areas as well as delivering on the volume recovery in M&M, the pricing recovery and all those things that we've laid out relative to the deal. Hassan Ahmed : Fair enough. Very helpful. And as a follow-up, you had a nice sort of bump up in EM businesses EBITDA margins Q4 to Q1, around 20% EBITDA margins you guys reported for Q1. And obviously, you gave some near-term sort of guidance showing the uplift in EBITDA in that business. But from a margin perspective, longer term, as we look at sort of 2024 and beyond, where do you see EM business sort of EBITDA margins going? Because historically, pre-M&M you guys were sort of reporting sort of EBITDA margins well into the sort of low to mid-30% range. I mean, should we eventually expect sort of move towards those sort of levels of margins? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, in Q1, the combined Engineered Materials was about 20%. We expect that to move up across the year really as we lift the EBITDA margins on the M&M business. So by the end of the year, I think we should be more around that 23% range for the year. And I fully expect as we continue to grow M&M as we continue to grow our base business as we continue to high grade the portfolio and realize the value of the synergies that we will move into that more historical level of 25% to 30% EBITDA margins, which is actually about where we've been in the last few years. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Jaideep Pandya : Thanks. Just want to say, it's very commendable that you guys have loaded the balance sheet with debt and not gone for the rights issue. But since the deal, the world has changed quite significantly and you're doing everything you can to sort of rightsize the business. But I just want to understand the legacy EM business, how are you making sure you're not starving this of capital because there's a lot of focus on M&M. That's my first question. The second question is on the competitive landscape in China. As a lot of Nylon 6 and 6 foliation capacity coming in China. So just putting in context of the value chain, do you actually benefit because the chain is going long in polymerization in China? Or is this going to create headaches on the pricing for you Lori Ryerkerk : Look, on the question around legacy EM, I think the thing to realize is we've really focused in the last 6 months in forming 1 Celanese team. So we have put an organization in place that brings all of our businesses, including Santoprene together, under new business line groups under the best set of leaders that we could pick out of the combined organization. And we've really focused on developing a culture of 1 Celanese. So we're not looking -- although for the benefits of this call, we do talk about how we're doing in each part of the business, we're not running it as 2 separate businesses.  We're running it as 1 business. We have everybody on the same sales platform. We have everybody in the project model. We look at our capital processes have been combined. So we look at it in the same way. So I don't think we're at any risk of ignoring one part of the business to benefit if the other because we really are running it as one business now, even though -- because we currently still have 2 financial systems until we can integrate the IT systems, we are able to track it separately. But in terms of how we're running it, their combined sales team, we're approaching customers as 1 Celanese with a full slate of products. And if you look at -- you may be concerned because of some of the callouts we've done in the reduction of CapEx. But really, if you look at that reduction in CapEx, it's really just about reassessing the timing of our projects to really align with the revised demand outlook we have now and also integrating the M&M capacity we have into the project views to say, we may now have capacity on the ground. We don't use to go build it. So really optimizing the combined capacity we have, which has led us delay or eliminate some of the projects that we had thought we would need to do to gain capacity. So we haven't really canceled any material projects. We haven't made any significant cuts to our reliability and maintenance and those things that make us a reliable supplier for our customers. This is really about optimizing the new footprint and adjusting our CapEx to go with the new demand forecast we have going forward. And then on the question on polymerization of PA66, I mean there is a lot of PA66 capacity coming on in Asia. I think 1 thing to remember is a very small portion of PA66 production actually goes into Engineered Materials, a vast majority of it goes into fibers. And so it doesn't all dumb into engineered materials. I mean that is really a function of compounding and others.  It is, though, one of the reasons we have been so focused on building optionality into our supply chain raw material polymer, so that we can have a choice in terms of make versus buy whichever is the most economically attractive. It's why do we have a contract that allows us more flexibility. That's why we're trying to get our inventories back to a level of control and that's why we're really looking at the totality of our footprint to really be able to take advantage of LODA66 material prices, if that's available. or to make it if we see an advantage to continue to produce ourselves. Brandon Ayache : Darryl, we'll take 1 more question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. John Roberts : You Converted M&M over to the Celanese project pipeline and backlog model. How would you characterize their number of new projects versus the legacy Celanese and backlog? Lori Ryerkerk : That's a good question. I'm not sure I have a number in front of me. What I'd say is we've been pleased with their willingness to use the model, if you will, and their understanding of how this adds value to the new Celanese. And I'd say the projects that are being tendered are growing as we move through this transition and people really understand what we're looking for. Again, it helps that we have combined everybody into one organization. We have one sales team. And so our growth in the project pipeline is good. We are a little bit separate from that, but we also are finding a lot of interesting things in the M&M T&I portfolio we hope to be able to bring to market. And so I think I would just expect to see it accelerate over time as we get everybody fully on board and adjusted to the Celanese way of working. John Roberts : And then you've restarted the VAM unit in Germany. If there's a cold winter or some sort of energy supply disruption. Have you made enough changes to keep that plant up in that scenario? Or will you just shut it down again if we get an end new spike? Lori Ryerkerk : So John, I would say it was still economically attractive to run it last year when we shut it down on its own, it would have been economically attractive, but the situation there was the global demand was so low, it was more economically a taste down and supply material out of the U.S. So it really is a question of total demand profile across the globe. It is an attractive unit. It is it is cost efficient. It really was related to the high energy prices we saw there. So our intent would be to run it. We hope demand would keep up with that, but we will always look at our entirety of our portfolio and make decisions about what to run and what not to run based on what's most economically attractive. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Brandon Ayache for any closing remarks. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call for any follow-up questions you may have. Darryl, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

At this time I would like to hand the call over to Brandon Ayache Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Brandon Ayache : Thank you Darren. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation second quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its second quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted the prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both press release and prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. As we published our prepared comments yesterday, we'll go ahead and go directly to questions. Darren, please go ahead and open up the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess first off, Lori in your prepared comments you had some comments about China and some of the trends that you saw in 3Q. I was just hoping, you could give us a little bit more color in terms of how things are evolving at that point in context of all the chatter about stimulus, et cetera. Are you starting to see any signs of that permeating through to your business? Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you, Ghansham. When we look at China, it's been a difficult year in China, clearly, as we've seen depressed demand consistent with the rest of the world but probably more pronounced in China. I think what we see different now as we start moving through the year, we saw some signs of it early in 2Q, already is despite lower demand conditions, conditions especially for the Acetyl Chain seem a bit tighter. And the reason I say that is when we saw some unexpected outages in the second quarter and here really in July, we did see pretty rapid price response to those outages, which suggests that there's not a lot of spare inventory or spare capacity in that area. And if you look at utilization for acetyls for China \u2013 for global asset it's around 90% about the same in China. So again, that suggests to us that although demand hasn't recovered significantly, there is enough demand matches with the supply that we are in a place where we can see some price movement up as we see supply growing. I would say we're not seeing a lot of response yet to the stimulus. We hear a lot about it. We haven't seen a lot of response yet. But we think it's coming. And there are some pockets of strength in China, in particular, autos remains pretty strong in China and the broader Asia area. But we see the pockets of weakness as well, electronics, especially consumer electronics, consumer goods, and I would say challenged by the situation in Europe and the core economy in Europe, which is limiting exports out of China, which is also I think putting a damper on production of goods in China. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Terrific. Thanks for that Lori. And then in terms of the current operating environment obviously, it's very complex. And you're pulling the levers that you need to in terms of managing supply, et cetera. In the scenario that this sort of complexity spills over into 2024, what are some of the other internal offsets we should keep in mind as it relates to the variances 2024 versus 2023 from an earnings standpoint? Lori Ryerkerk : Ghansham, I think it's a good point. We really have no visibility into 2024 at this time. So we don't really know what demand is going to look like in 2024. If I had to guess, I'd say it's going to be better than 2023, but we don't know. But there are a few things we do know that we know will give us an uplift and we are confident will give us an uplift in 2024. So if you start with the engineering materials side, with the amount of inventory draw down we're doing this year, we will be able to have completely flushed through our higher cost inventory as we move into 2024, which will give us lower variable costs in 2024. We'll see less hits to our P&L from the inventory reductions. We'll see those in 2023. We don't anticipate a lot of those continuing into 2024. So that will be an uplift. We have an additional $150 million of M&M synergies, which we will hit next year. That's helped by our first quarter SAP integration, which will get everything on the system and give us additional opportunities for synergy as we get everything fully integrated and cost takeout. And of course with the lack of destocking, I would expect to see next year, since we'll have taken so much destocking this year, in addition to that lift then we'll get from share recovery, we should continue to see M&M volume recovery in particular. On the Acetyl side, we know at a minimum, we have at least this additional $100 million contribution from Clear Lake asset that we have next year. And then with the more than $1 billion of net -- debt reduction that we will take this year, we'll have lower interest expenses next year. So again, if you take all those factors, those are things that we feel very confident will lift our earnings from '23 to '24, regardless of what happens to demand. Ghansham Panjabi : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Michael Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. Michael Leithead : Great. Thank you. Good morning. First question, when you look at the weakness in Engineered Materials during 2Q and into 3Q, can you help us roughly understand, how much is just due to weaker end demand versus how much is due to weaker price? And other than POM, can you talk about where you're seeing the most competitive pricing pressure today? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. Thanks, Mike for your question. As we look at Q2, if we look at what we had guided to versus our performance, I mean clearly, we were below what we had expected in the quarter. I'd say half of that gap came from the M&M side. About half of that was really the inventory drawdown in M&M, which we really hadn't anticipated, so the earnings associated with that. And the other half is really just the weak demand, again especially industrial and electronics. And how I would try to describe what's happened in demand? If you look at differentiated products, that's really where we've seen lower volumes. We've seen our customers taking lower volumes of differentiated products again, because they don't have the end market for their goods. And we haven't moved price on differentiated. We've been able to hold price, but we've just seen the volume drop off. We have chosen to take molecules instead of moving them and therefore not needing them in differentiated. We've gone ahead and increased sales into the standard grade market, where we are able to capture volume, but at a lower margin or a lower price. So it is a combination of volume and price and it is a big factor of mix in terms of less differentiated, more standard grade, again, allows us to keep volume, which we think is important as we move towards recovery, but we've had to take some price concessions to make that happen. And in terms of what -- molecules -- I mean, POM is certainly the big one, I'd say for the heritage selling these molecules. We've had a few others especially those more differentiated molecules that go into electronics, connectors and that sort of thing, which have also had a volume impact. I think it's short-term. I think we'll see recovery there. And then on the M&M side, it's nylon. And again, I would say it's that switch from differentiated standard grade is more significant in terms of earnings than necessarily the volume -- any volume impact. Michael Leithead : Okay. That's super helpful. And then just second, if I look at your updated EPS guidance, it seems to imply going from about $2.25 at the midpoint in the third quarter to slightly north of $3 in 4Q. So can you just help us understand, what you think kind of gets sequentially better there in the fourth quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Sure. As we move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, there's a couple of things happening. One is, we have initiated about an additional $60 million to $80 million of cost control. And most of that impact will show up in the fourth quarter since this is work that we've been doing just the last few months. So, most of that will show up in the fourth quarter. You have additional M&M synergies, which show up in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And then we are expecting a pretty robust fourth quarter. In fact right now, we would say we would expect fourth quarter to be our best quarter of the year. So partly we think that's on destocking. We think destocking in the Western Hemisphere should be over for the most part in the third quarter, probably a little bit of destocking carrying into the fourth quarter from Asia. We also think, we'll have less seasonality, because we've had so much destocking across the year, we wouldn't expect the usual amount of seasonal destocking that we see in the fourth quarter. And the last factor I would say is, given the acquisition of M&M, we are now more heavily weighted towards Asia and China than we were before. And typically fourth quarter is a very strong quarter in Asia and China, as we go before Chinese New Year, which will more than offset any seasonality we would expect to see in the Western Hemisphere. Michael Leithead : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks, very much. Can you talk about VAM volume growth or contraction by geography please? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks Jeff. On VAM, Jeff in general, the markets have been a little weak for VAM as we've seen. I would say, Europe is still our most challenged geography. Really there's not been a rebound in paints and coatings, construction and building, as we continue to see the economy really drag on VAM. I think globally, the indication of this is we do see VAM utilization has moderated into the mid-80s on a global basis, which is the lowest we've seen for many years, I would say, I mean really since early COVID. We are seeing some recovery in VAM in the US. I'd say especially -- or in the Americas I should say. Especially in packaging, packaging continues to be pretty strong. And that's one of our bigger end markets in the Americas. And then in China, although, we see some of the more industrial uses of VAM coming back again not seen a lot of rebound yet in construction and building, although with some of the stimulus that's been announced perhaps that has to come here in the second half. Jeff Zekauskas : Okay. And then for Scott, are there any hard objectives that you need to reach in order to retain your investment-grade rating, or are there no hard objectives? Scott Richardson : Yeah. I think Jeff, we've been talking very consistently going back to when we announced the deal in 2022 about two focus areas. The first is reducing net debt by $1 billion in 2023, and then achieving three times, levered towards the end of 2024 into early 2025. And I think those continue to be where we're focused on. I think that first objective as we called out in the prepared comments, we're very confident given the cash flow that we're going to generate this year of hitting that $1 billion of debt reduction. And then with the additional proceeds coming in from the Food Ingredients transaction that will allow us to actually go up another $450 million above that from a debt reduction perspective. So definitely on track and tracking ahead for that first objective and then continuing to build plans and a focus around cash generation and harvesting, as well as the EBITDA lift into 2024 that Lori talked about a few minutes ago to be able to get to that second objective. Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Josh Spector : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Just in your prepared remarks, you talked about the mix impact within M&M. and just recall one of your opportunities to grow earnings you're going to go after some of the more commodity markets that maybe DuPont walked away from. Has anything there changed in terms of that mix impact or really where you can go after different shares? Any of that taking place this year, or is that more of a longer-term target now? Lori Ryerkerk : No, I wouldn't say the longer-term target. It's just -- it will take us probably through the end of 2024 or maybe even in 2025 to recover all of that volume. I mean, some of the strength you see in M&M volume is starting to get some of that standard grade back. Again, we've had some offsets though as we've had lower demand for differentiated grades. But we have been able to go after and get some of that standard grade back. I mean, the good news is DuPont's Zytel has really been specced into all of these standard grades at some point. So it's not a question of having to recertify. But some of the standard grade markets do work on contracts. So we need to wait for people's contracts to roll out so we can get the opportunity to go in there. So I would say, we're on track with our plan to recover standard grade more commodity grades, if you will to use your words materials. But it is something that will take us several years to get it back fully, again just because of the way the business is contracted. Josh Spector : Thanks. And just on the cash side, I guess, I mean with the JV you liberated some additional cash, I mean, how do you think about the opportunities there over the next year or so? Are there any other opportunities that you could maybe accelerate because of the uncertain demand environment, or should we think about improvement being more organic based? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : So I'll let Scott comment on the math. What I would say is, look, we remain confident in our ability to generate sufficient cash flow through earnings and through inventory drawdown and other steps to meet all of our debt requirements and commitments. And so we'll continue to be opportunistic as we always have been in terms of future divestments and opportunities. That really hasn't changed again, because we have a lot of confidence in our ability to meet our cash commitments. Scott Richardson : Yeah. And I think, while we'll be opportunistic on possible other deals our focus really is on what we can really control. And we've been now talking most of this year about reducing our inventories and harvesting cash from the balance sheet and then focusing on cash our CapEx bringing that down to $500 million this year and then as we put in the prepared comments lowering even further down to $400 million next year. And so with that, and then the expectation of higher earnings we do believe that, as we continue to work our way through the second half of this year, and then into next year, the free cash flow generation will be robust and then we will use that cash to continue to aggressively lower that. Josh Spector : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. Vincent Andrews : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Scott, I'm wondering, if you can give us any more color on your comments in the prepared remarks about being able to term the debt out and remove the refi risk from the next several years? Scott Richardson : Yeah. I mean, we put the maturities in place that we did a year ago because that's what was available to us. And what that yielded was higher levels of maturities coming up in 2024 and 2025. And so as we said at the time we would be opportunistic around what we could do to bring those towers down. As we look at the landscape, we think there could be an opportunity for us to bring those down and really match up the maturities over the next few years with the lower levels of cash flow that we're at with where the economy is right now, but still very robust and so bringing those down to the levels of free cash flow generation in the next couple of years. Vincent Andrews : And that would be straight debt, or are you considering a convertible type thing or anything like that? Scott Richardson : Our focus in the past has really been around bonds and term loans. And we think that's been the right structure for us from a capital perspective. We've looked at everything, but that's our current focus. Vincent Andrews : Okay. Thank you very much. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceeds with your questions. Michael Sison : Hi. Good morning. In the last quarter you had a -- you gave us a bridge to get that extra dollar per share a couple of things M&M integration, unwinding high-cost inventory lower natural gas and a couple of other things. So when you think about that dollar, is -- could you just give us a little bit of color of, how that has changed in the sense that is it -- you still have that dollar but there's a bunch more minuses that sort of get you to the third quarter and fourth quarter outlook? Lori Ryerkerk : Mike, if you look at that, we really -- we were seeing some uplift in acetyl, last quarter when we gave our outlook. We had expected that to probably continue over the quarter. Obviously and acetyl had a good quarter. They came in at the bottom end of the range, but not further up in the range, because we did see some settling back if you will to below -- kind of at cost curve levels. And then, in Engineered Materials, as I said, what we really saw is, we saw a bit more of an inventory impact in M&M. We saw this really continued destocking and especially in industrial and E&E. And we had last -- again, for the same reasons, as acetyl when we did our earnings call last quarter we really were seeing strong order books in April and saw that as an indication of some recovery happening across the quarter. And again, in May and June we saw that really not happen. So I think, we -- certainly while we're just pointing our performance, I think we understand it. And I think we feel very confident though, in the guide that we've given for the rest of the year. Michael Sison : Got it. And then, again, if you take a look at your outlook the prior quarter, fourth quarter would have been somewhere around $3.50. And I think there was some confidence that, that would be a good run rate heading into 2024, meeting $14-some like EPS. So when you think about the new run rate of $3 in the fourth quarter, I know predicting next year is a little bit early but, how do you think about that $3 in the fourth quarter as it relates to a run rate potential for 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I don't -- again, just looking at the actions I laid out earlier, the things that are within our control. I think that's a very reasonable expectation. Michael Sison : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceeds with your questions. Hassan Ahmed : Good morning, Lori and Scott. In your prepared remarks you guys talked about, the destocking lasting longer than previous cycles. Now obviously having lived through 2008, 2009, the COVID lockdown period and the like, I mean, multiple lessons must have been learned. So my question really is that, as you think about the restock -- being a longer duration de-stock, certainly seems like a deeper de-stock. What potentially over the next couple of years do you think the restock will look like? And I guess where I'm going with this is, has the sort of inventory appetite of your customers changed materially, living through all the craziness of the last decade or so? Lori Ryerkerk : That's a really interesting question Hassan. It's always hard to predict some of our customer behavior. I think we are seeing a very deep de-stock. And I think that speaks to the uncertainty, people feel about the market. I think again especially the uncertainty in Europe, and what that means just not for the European market, but also for the China export market. If we look at US markets, I would say reasonably recovered probably not a lot of destocking left. I would tell you though, China, for China is doing okay, but China for export is really where that uncertainty lies. And we see value continue to be taken out of the chain as well as all of the -- everything into Europe. So it's a very kind of unusual global situation that we have right now as a result. I think -- and with low prices people assume prices are staying low. So there's no reason to carry inventory. There's a lot of availability of material. So there's no reason to carry inventory. But we also saw post-COVID, how this can change very quickly. As soon as prices start to increase, as soon as we start to see consistent demand recovery, I do believe customers won't want to be back in the same situation they were at the end of 2020 and we'll start to see people wanting to restock. So, maybe a direct answer to your question, I think it is a deeper destocking because of the accumulation of just global macroeconomics, geopolitics, and everything else. But I have no reason to think we won't see a recovery at some point. And I think -- I don't think people have gotten comfortable with a lower level of inventory once demand comes back. I think there's just a lot of uncertainty about what is that timing of demand recovery. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. And as a follow-up on the EM side of it, again, in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about moving from exclusive distribution arrangements in the West to dual or multi-distribution approaches. How do you see the impact of that sort of playing out near-term as well as on a go-forward basis? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I think it's really a matter here of we are such a much bigger company now that continuing to have single distributors in these major geographies is probably not giving us the breadth and the reach to the amount of customers we need to be reaching to generate the new opportunities and volume sales that we desire to have. So, this is just about we need to have multiple partners to really get to the full range of customers and the full range of end markets. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thank you so much Lori. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions. Kevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Just a follow up on the balance sheet discussion. Scott you ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and I believe you have another $450 million coming in from the Nutrinova deal. Is it your intention to just continue to accumulate cash to address your senior unsecured notes due in July of 2024, or would you prefer to refinance them over the next few quarters instead of paying them off with cash? Scott Richardson : Yes, Kevin, I think we're not in the business of holding cash right now. We want to find ways at which to reduce that debt as quickly as we can. We still have term loans that we have coming up and so we can utilize that cash for the term loans. I would also remind you we do have a $300 million interest payment in the third quarter. So, we will use the cash we have on hand for that. And then we have maturities coming up still later this year that we will handle as well. We've talked very openly about having cash in other geographies that we need to move back to the US and we're building those pipelines now and we expect to be able to get that cash back here to the US by the end of the year. And then once we get our systems integrated in the first part of next year, that will give us an ability to operate the company at a much lower amount of cash probably right around $500 million. So, I think with that, that's going to free-up a lot of opportunity for us to use that cash for deleveraging, given the maturities we have coming up plus the term loans we have outstanding. Kevin McCarthy : I see. Thank you for that. And then on a related note your balance sheet reflects approximately $1.5 billion as the sum of short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt. That actually ticked up a little bit. Sequentially, I would have thought that it would go the other way with the term loan paydown of $370 million. Can you speak to what's in there in terms of how much you might have drawn on the revolver and what you might owe affiliates at this point? Scott Richardson : Yes. Mainly it's ticked up Kevin just because of foreign exchange mainly the euro moved up a little bit, but that's the big delta there. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matthew DeYoe with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Matthew DeYoe : Thank you. It seems like a sharp acceleration in the China macro, I don't know maybe needed to improve the POM and PA66 trade flows. Like is that right? And does the recent PA66 capacity expansions within Asia-China make that business recovery more challenging? Lori Ryerkerk : Look our outlook is really not based on any increase in demand. We have a little bit of improvement of destocking occurring in the rest of the year again based on our view of the market. But we really aren't forecasting any uptick in demand in any particular region. So, I wouldn't say that's needed to meet our $9 to $10 range for the year. Certainly would be welcome but I wouldn't say it's needed. And I would say the expansions in nylon, nylon has always been pretty well supplied. There's been plenty of compounders, there's been plenty of polymerization out there, the expansion that you've seen or maybe more on the upstream side the raw material side of that. So, I don't see that that really changes our dynamics much around nylon. We continue to focus our nylon on more differentiation, getting into highly differentiated products, looking for new applications, new end markets that share regain based on our good customer relationships, especially in standard grade, that's what I talked about earlier the regain of share over the next couple of years with those and really taking advantage of our integrated value chain and our option to be in or out of the polymerization market depending on where things are. So I'd say, I think we're positioned well to either make -- or buy it whatever works out. And our value really comes from differentiation. Maybe if I can give you some examples because we've often gotten this question around nylon relative to EVs. We've recently actually just completed two new contracts for EV parts made from nylon. One is for major OEM, we have a part now going into EV motor mounts which we'll use Zytel. And then we have a second application we just finished for the AC compressor bracket, which is made from Zytel, which is going into EVs. And why this is important is, we talked about at the time of the deal but may have gone unnoticed is, there are a lot of applications for nylon into EVs, especially as you think about EVs being quiet. People want less noise, they need less vibration. And polymer parts and in particular in nylon for those that require strengths are great parts to replace metal and other things not just for light weighting but also to give consumers the experience they want from an EV. And so we're already starting to see some successes using the Celanese knowledge of the EV market in our contact with those customers and applying Zytel to those and winning some new businesses there. Matthew DeYoe : I appreciate that. I guess, I wasn't necessarily worried about the 9% to 10% number this year in recovery more just in general with repairing some of these markets, like particularly I guess POM. Because it's not one we have a ton of line of sight into from a supply/demand basis. Is it really just trade flows from China and China is kind of sitting on the cost curve into Europe, or is there -- and if that's the case I guess what reverse is that? Scott Richardson : Matthew, I think it's important -- we have a lot of history here in POM. And these situations tend to be temporary where co-producers in the market have made too much material and they move it into other regions even if they just have to get rid of that material. Our cost to serve in Europe and the US is really unparalleled with our facilities in Bishop, Texas as well as there in Frankfurt, Germany. And with that our ability to win sustainably has been proven out over time. These do tend to be temporary fluctuations. So we do not expect that this is something that is going to continue for the foreseeable future. Matthew DeYoe : Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the guidance. So, now the new midpoint is around $9.50, and if you just go through the Q3 that $2.10 to $2.50 with $2.30 at the midpoint, it kind of implies around $3 for Q4. So you noted that Q4 is going to be your strongest quarter. Could you just maybe bucket out that bridge between $2.30 and $3 from Q3 to Q4? We can do the math, but I just wanted to hear it from you as well as to how the two segments kind of play out. Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I would say -- I would expect for the year, we've called out Acetyl Chain will be a foundational level of earnings. So you can pencil in $1.3 billion for the Acetyl Chain, so essentially a second half very similar to the first half. And then in Engineered Materials is where we'll see the lift. And again, about half of that coming from -- or maybe a little more -- probably about half of that coming from M&M really as we continue to regain share as we continue to move pricing on differentiated grades and then you also have the other half coming from EM as we see the end of destocking really here in the Americas and a little bit of recovery and other -- well not really recovery but end of destocking in other markets. We also get a little bit of -- the biggest piece of this though and a lot of this will be in EM is the $60 million to $80 million of additional cost and productivity activities that we've undertaken, most of which will show up in the fourth quarter. And again, you'll also have the help in M&M from the additional uplift of synergies in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and a little bit of help from lower interest expense on debt paydown. So all of those together, accumulate to make fourth quarter what should be our best quarter of the year. Arun Viswanathan : All right. Thanks for that. And just as a follow-up then. So you'll be exiting the year at maybe a $3 run rate gets you kind of back into that $11 to $12 range for next year. Is that the right way to think about it? I mean are you seeing the end of this destocking cycle? And was there any risk to that view? Would it be maybe an automotive kind of slowdown from the strike or anything like that, or is there -- what are some of the risks to maybe not achieve that level of earnings power as you look into 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Again, if I go back to what I went through earlier, if I look at 2024, I don't -- look, I think that number that you're laying out there is not a bad number from kind of a base. But if you look, there are a lot of things -- and that just assumes steady demand with the end of 2024, which again, we're not -- with the end of 2023. And again, we're not forecasting any great uptick in demand at the end of 2023, we're just forecasting into destocking. So I don't see a lot of destocking continuing to occur next year. And again if we look at just those things we can control, we will be in a better position from a variable cost standpoint as we flush high cost inventory out of the system this year. We will not have the inventory, the level of inventory reduction hit next year, which will help next year. We have the additional $150 million of M&M synergies. And we have the additional $100 million from Clear Lake assets. So I would say, if you take the fourth quarter and annualize it, I would see that more as a floor than as our expected level of performance for next year. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. David Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Lori, do you have an updated forecast for M&M EBITDA for the full year? Brandon Ayache : Scott, do you have that number? Scott Richardson : Yeah. David, I think as we put out the Q3 number, it's another lift off of where we were in the second quarter, which was a lift off of the first quarter. As we go into Q4 as Lori mentioned, we would expect another lift up. So that puts you in that range when you add up kind of all of those numbers somewhere in that $500 million to $600 million range. We're going to try to get to the top end of that range or even exceed it depending on where Q4 lands, but that's where we'd be. But you're getting a lot closer on a quarterly basis as you end the year to that quarterly accretion level that we talked about last quarter. David Begleiter : Understood. And Lori just on the additional $60 million to $80 million of cost reductions, is that permanent? Is it somewhat temporary? And is it -- a little more color on that would be helpful. Thank you. Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. If I look at the $60 million to $80 million, some of it is definitely one-time. So if you look about half of it is related to production actions. So these are things that are focused on the fact that we have lower demand, and so better optimizing when we're taking turnarounds, how we're doing turnarounds. I mean, if we don't need the capacity right -- back right away for example, we can do it without overtime and just take a bit longer to do a turnaround. We are idling facilities not so much entire facilities but say lines within a compounding unit. So that allows us not to staff as much power savings, et cetera. So reduced over time, reduced use of contractors, again really in response to demand. So I would say those are one-time or temporary actions. They're not things that -- hopefully demand comes back and then these are things that we can reverse. And the other half, I would say these tend to be -- a lot of them tend to be small and a lot of these are one-time as well. So continuing to really reduce travel across Celanese, which is worth a few million, reduction in promotional and marketing spend, a few million as well. So again most of these are temporary. Look there are some things there, which is acceleration of the synergies that we have laid out for the acquisition of M&M. So where we have redundant positions for example in the organization going ahead and removing those redundancies now versus maybe having waited until later in the year or even into next year. And so I'd say it's probably just guessing off the top of my head, kind of, two-thirds things that I'd say are more temporary in nature and related to the reduction in demand that we're seeing and our focus on maximizing cash in this period of time. And then the other one-third would be acceleration of steps we had planned to take later in the year and into next year. David Begleiter : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. Duffy Fischer : Yeah. Good morning. Could you just comment, have you seen any change in behavior in polyplastics since you sold your half to Daicel? And are they part of the competitive dynamics issues that you called out in those increased imports into Europe? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. I don't think we've really seen any difference in their behavior. I mean nothing different than we're seeing in the rest of the industry in response to the macro conditions that we're all experiencing right now. Duffy Fischer : Fair enough. And then sequentially or year-over-year, what did Ibn Sina contribute to 2Q, and then what does that do in the back half of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yeah. So year-over-year, Ibn Sina that's probably the easier way for me to think about it. 2022 was higher crude prices, higher methanol prices. We had a really healthy contribution from Ibn Sina. This year I believe Ibn Sina is going to be in that $60 million to $70 million less in contribution than last year -- for the full year. It's because our total for all of the joint ventures is about $100 million less in 2023 versus 2022. And that's the combination of Ibn Sina and KEPCO -- moving KEPCO to a manufacturing joint venture. Duffy Fischer : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. This is Ryan [ph] on for Aleksey. Just on -- my first question here is you flagged the $30 million to $35 million headwind in EM from destocking during Q2. Now based off your commentary on the call I presume, this is something that would continue in 3Q. But is something that you could get partially back in 4Q, as destocking kind of ends here? Lori Ryerkerk : Ryan, I'm sorry you were breaking up, a little bit. I believe your question is the $35 million headwind that we had in second quarter due to destocking would we expect to recover that in the third quarter or sometimes later. Was that your question? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, that was it. Lori Ryerkerk : Okay. Great. I wouldn't necessarily say we expect to recover it. It's a onetime thing. Now some time in the future, do you get some benefit from restocking, as we see demand come back strongly and people want to return to inventory levels, certainly. But I don't have any idea when that would be, and that's kind of a hard thing to track. I would expect third quarter destocking, will be a similar level to second quarter in terms of the financial implications. So I wouldn't expect big -- further big pluses or minus, maybe a little bit more down in the third quarter because we'll have more finished goods destocking and less raw material and intermediate destocking, but not hugely significant. So I wouldn't expect a second to third quarter, big change relative to destocking. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Got it. Thank you. And then just my second question is, you flagged the delayed start up at Clear Lake, due to some component defects. I understand the financial impact of it is $25 million. But are there any material costs, that go along with this? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : No. It's really the impact of not being able to get our synergies. I mean obviously, with the lower demand profile there is capacity in the world. So, we don't anticipate, a big impact there. And the cost of the site itself is covered by the manufacturer since the manufacturer is responsible for the defect. Operator : Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, So the cash generation Scott, it looks like you've [indiscernible] pulled down CapEx for next year. Are levers as we look to 2024 that you still feel like you can pull is there more kind of to ring out of the working capital side of things? Are there other integration costs that can maybe be pushed off? I guess, how should we be thinking about some of the puts and takes for free -- coming in next year? Scott Richardson : Yes. I think we've been very open about our priority to free cash flow here in 2023, John and that doesn't change going into 2024. We put the $400 million CapEx number out for next year, that's the first step. On the inventory side of things, $400 million to $450 million reduction this year. There will likely be more opportunity going into next year, just given how much raw materials have come up over the course of the last several years, which we expect kind of volumes to be at good levels as we finish this year, from an inventory standpoint. But there will likely be more value opportunity, as we work our way into next year to convert more working capital there. And then continuing to focus aggressively on terms and looking for other working capital opportunities, the teams are really focused heavily on that cash side. And then when you kind of then layer in the elements of controllable EBITDA growth, that Lori has mentioned several times on the call, we feel very good about the opportunity to continue to drive free cash flow going next year. John McNulty : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then just a question on EM's differentiated products. Have you -- it sounds like so far, you haven't seen much in the way of pricing pressure there. Do you expect to see any as you kind of look out over, the next whatever, call it 12 months just given the level of deflation that we've seen across so many industries so far? Lori Ryerkerk : No, John, not really. Like I said, we've seen some demand softness just based on our customers' demand softness for their products. But again, we would expect that this is temporary and that will come back. And we've not seen -- as we typically don't see a lot of pressure on pricing for our differentiated products. A \u2013 Brandon Ayache : We will take one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Roberts : Thank you. How is the Food Ingredients business performing into the deal closing? We've got some pretty broad weakness, in the Food Ingredients overall market. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think our Food Ingredients is performing as expected, and as we laid out at the beginning of the year. We really haven't had any issues there. Scott Richardson : Yes, John, that business tends to be pretty resilient through most economic conditions. John Roberts : And then with the recent rise in oil prices, is there any risk to the Singapore unit being curtailed later in the year if oil continues up? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I would say no more than it ever is. I mean, we constantly flex or Singapore and our Nanjing units depending on economics depending on regional demand and the cost to supply those regional demand. With this level of crude pricing and coal pricing in China, I don't see that dynamic changing significantly. John Roberts : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Brandon Ayache for closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone, for listening in today. As always, we're around for any follow-up questions you have. Darryl, please go ahead and close up the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Kevin. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Richardson, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today\u2019s presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both the press release as well as the prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Before opening it up for your questions, let me turn it over to Lori to provide a few introductory comments. Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Brandon. So we have done and announced a lot recently. So I just wanted to take a minute or two to emphasize again exactly what we are all working so hard to achieve at Celanese. I can confidently say that at no point in our history, has there been a greater opportunity for Celanese to deliver significant earnings growth as in the next few years. In the Acetyl Chain, we continue to enhance our earnings power and optionality with projects like the acetic acid expansion at Clear Lake, and the methanol expansion also at Clear Lake which will dramatically strengthen our sustainable product offerings. Of course, in Engineering Materials, we continue to integrate and synergize the M&M acquisition, which transforms EM into the preeminent global specialty materials provider. This important and valuable work has been made more challenging in the demand backdrop that remains exceptionally weak and volatile. Our visibility into future macro conditions is limited. Regardless, our teams have worked tremendously hard to deliver three consecutive quarters of earnings growth since closing the M&M acquisition and to position us to meaningfully exceed our full-year objective to reduce net debt by $1 billion in 2023. The work has not been easy, and I sincerely thank each of our employees for their individual contributions and dedication. Quite frankly, while the work is moving forward at pace, the macro environment has temporarily masked some of the underlying financial benefit of our actions to strengthen our business. But we remain resolute in continuing to take decisive and controllable actions. Our most recent actions, including the announced changes to our leadership team and manufacturing footprint, are evidence of our ongoing commitment to drive earnings growth and execute against our delevering plan. The purpose behind the changes I have made in our executive leadership team is to enhance the alignment of our individual strengths and experience to accelerate and deliver on the many value-enhancing opportunities before us. Scott, Chuck and Ashley are exceptionally well prepared for their new roles, and I am confident these changes will immediately enhance the value we drive as a collective leadership team. I speak for our leadership team and broader Celanese in saying we are fully engaged and committed to delivering on the opportunities before us. With that, Kevin, let me turn it back over to you to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Mike Leithead from Barclays. Your line is now live. Michael Leithead : Great. And congrats to Scott, Chuck and Ashley on the new roles. Laurie, I wanted to start on Engineered Materials pricing. I think in the prepared remarks, you made a comment that pressure has widened throughout the year, but nothing indicates that structural. So can you maybe just talk a bit more about your confidence here or maybe what you have seen in previous down cycles versus now? Just what gives you the confidence in making that comment? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If I think about pricing, and again, I\u2019ll split it into two. What we have really seen is pretty good price stability and differentiated products. What we have seen them is more of the volume impact there associated with consumer able consumer electronics, there, we have just seen a pretty significant volume decline as we have seen consumer demand come off this year as people have shifted their spending to more services and experiences. Where we have really seen the price pressure is for more standard grade materials where we are seeing quite a bit of length in the industry in terms of supply, softer demand and everyone having to take price action to come down. What I would say is one of the reasons we are taking the steps that we have announced around [indiscernible] is really to better position our supply with the current demand scenario by shutting down some of our higher cost operating capacity filling those customer needs with lower cost capacity we already have or even purchases, if that is lower. And then in the future, as we see demand start to come back to what I would consider a more normalized level, we should be able to provide that demand from other assets that we already have in our network and through no and low-cost debottlenecks. So I think we are in a kind of unique position structurally with very little exports out of China. A very soft, soft environment in Europe and feel confident in time, it will come up. I mean, auto is a great example. Auto has been very solid this year. We expect that to continue. Medical has been solid. So I think we really are just seeing a reflection of consumer preference and consumer spending, which we believe is temporary and off the highs that we saw in 2021. Michael Leithead : And then a question for Scott, maybe on free cash flow. I think in Lori\u2019s 2024 outlook she laid out in the prepared remarks, maybe $300 million or $400 million of earnings improvement next year you guys are probably getting a similar type of amount of working capital benefit this year. So as we think about free cash generation next year, is relatively flat year-on-year, a good starting point today or is there further working capital or other cash benefits you think you can get next year? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks, Mike. We are going to work to ensure that as we see earnings growth that we put that as much to the bottom line of free cash flow as possible. We called out CapEx being $100 million lighter next year as well. I think the variable will be working capital. And it depends upon kind of what happens with raw material pricing as well as depending on kind of where sales are what happens with the accounts receivable line. But we are going to do everything we can to continue to bring inventory down next year. There could be an opportunity for further reduction depending on what happens with demand as well as in the raw material landscape. Operator : Next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Jeffrey Zekauskas : I think Eastman\u2019s filter tow profits are up I don\u2019t know, $225 million through the nine-months. There was no mention of filter to in your remarks. How is that business doing? And how is it affecting the acetal chain earnings? Lori Ryerkerk : Jeff, as you know, we are running that as an end-to-end chain now. We are treating to as we do other downstream derivatives. What I would say is we are seeing similar impacts in tow. Now we are seeing in the second half a reset of contract pricing, which is bringing those margins down slightly from the first half, but that was anticipated with the way the contracts are set up. But I would say we are still on track to exceed the $245 million that we set out earlier this year target for sale. Jeffrey Zekauskas : You are closing your German nylon facility. Is that about 15% of your nameplate capacity in nylon? And what utilization rate are you running at in nylon generally? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So [Untrip] (Ph) actually is one of the four plants that we have for nylon and it represents right at 25% of our total capacity. I don\u2019t have the overall total utilization numbers in front of us. But I would characterize this, Jeff, as much like we have done with Palm and other assets where we have really worked on concentrating our footprint taking out either underutilized or less profitable assets in order to shift volume into lower cost, more profitable assets, getting more flexibility in our networks in terms of purchasing either of polymer or different raw materials, depending on where we produce, that is what we are trying to be able to hear with the intro shutdown is we knew going into the deal that we believe DuPont had excess capacity. Now that we have had some time to look at it, we believe shutting down the Introp is the best way to really adjust our cost basis on nylon while still maintaining compounding in Europe, which is necessary for our customers. But I would say this is very consistent with what you have seen us done over the last 10 or so years in Celanese where we have probably shut down over 15 facilities in the last 10-years as we have implemented these models. Operator : Next question is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Michael Sison : You haven\u2019t told I need to do more math these days. So if I add up sort of your bridges that you gave for 2024 and just use the lower end of the inventory stuff. It looks like a no volume growth, you could do $12 or better. Is that the right math? And then can you help us on what or how to frame up volume and inflation or deflation upside for 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, Mike, we laid out the various buckets. So I think you can do the math. I mean, just to reiterate, we do expect to get more than $150 million in additional M&M synergy. With some of the acceleration of the manufacturing footprint optimization. Hopefully, we can exceed that amount as well since we didn\u2019t have all of that baked in. We should get another $100 million once we get clear like acetic acid started up. . Debt service goes down by about $50 million. We will have less inventory reduction next year, so less margin impact from that. And then I think, as you are saying, the big issue there is really going to be what is the benefit we see for flushing through higher cost inventory. And this could be a very big number. It will depend on what happens with raws. As you know, we are in quite a volatile raw material environment right now. And then what happens with demand going forward. If demand stays low, then I think these are the things we are focused on because these are what we can control. if demand goes up, obviously, we will get more margin, but we will also probably see some increase again in working capital. So I would just say there is still a lot of volatility and uncertainty around next year, and that is why we are just really focusing on those big buckets that we outlined that are in our control. Michael Sison : Got it. And then when you think about 2024, what do you think could happen to China, Auto and some of your end markets? Any initial thoughts when you talk to customers of what the demand environment could be next year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Again, if you can tell me what December is going to look like, maybe I would be better at thinking about 2024. I mean things are very uncertain and volatile at this point. I would say on Auto, consistent with the forecast you are seeing on auto build, we expect to see some moderate growth in Auto, really across all sectors, a couple of percent. And our growth should track that. We expect medical continue to be strong. I would say, based on conversations with customers, I would expect some moderate growth across next year as we start to see some demand coming back. But I would also say the timing of when that starts and the pace at which that happens is very uncertain. So certainly a lot less conviction at this point on next year than we might usually have at this point given the volatility we are seeing. Operator : Next question today is coming from Josh Spector from UBS. Your line is now live. Joshua Spector : So I wanted to follow up on the price cost or like the inventory or lower cost inventory that can flow through. I guess, Lori, you sound a bit more uncertain on that, but it still could be large I guess if you look at where pricing is in fourth quarter, is that a level if that holds, you would actually get a spread benefit into next year? Or do you need pricing to move up from here? Just wondering around the kind of moving parts there. Lori Ryerkerk : No. Look, even I think at the pricing we are seeing now, we are starting to see some pull through of that lower cost inventory, and we see that as a moderate impact on our quarter-on-quarter growth. So I think even at these pricing, we would expect to continue to see some portion of that pull-through. . Obviously, if we saw pricing increase, that would help more, but we also have to consider what the price of rods going in, and we are seeing some upward pressure on raw materials this quarter as well. But look, I would say in all cases, we expect some impact from that flushing through of higher cost inventory. It is just the magnitude will depend on raws as well as future pricing. Joshua Spector : Okay. Yes. I guess just maybe depend that when you talk about it being the biggest bridge item, if pricing stays where it is, is that a true statement? Or does that come down? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say pricing in raws stay where they are, that would still be a true statement. . Operator : Next question today is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Vincent Andrews : I just wanted to ask a couple of things. One, in Acetyl\u2019s in the third quarter, there clearly was a benefit despite a bunch of headwinds from outages in Asia. So I\u2019m wondering if you have any way of sort of sizing that in the third quarter and what you anticipate in the fourth quarter? It seems like there is some comments that you are still going to have some higher pricing flowing through in the fourth quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering if that is just sort of a delay of inventory flowing through or what? And then secondly, on the tax rate, I understand why it is lower this year and that it was originally contemplated in the lower guidance. But if the demand environment is going to stay not all that different from where it is today at least through the first half of next year, does that mean you have a lower-than-normal tax rate next year as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, Vince, let me see if I can answer that. What I would say is we did see a positive influence from the higher Asia pricing that we saw as a result of supply outages in the third quarter. Most of those occurred in the last few weeks of the year. I would think of those as pretty much offsetting the impact of the contract pricing reduction that we had called out and the turnaround impact that we saw. . What I would say is, going into the fourth quarter now, we have seen that price drop back to closer to the cost curve, maybe slightly above it. So we have kind of lost that benefit in China. We will see a little bit of benefit, although significantly less of that in the Western Hemisphere in the fourth quarter. because typically, Western Hemisphere pricing lags by about a quarter. So we will see some benefit, but not to the same extent that we saw the benefit in the third quarter. Scott Richardson : And then on the tax rate, Vincent, a lot is just going to depend upon the geographic mix of earnings, if things stay exactly as they are this year, then certainly, we could be at lower levels. If we things normalize back to kind of what I would say is the normal mix of geographic demand, then we\u2019d be back more next year in that kind of 12% range. Operator : Next question today is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. David Begleiter : First, congratulations to Scott Truck & Ashley. Lori and Scott, just on EM pricing. Pricing is up about 38% in 2021, 2022, should be down this year, maybe around 8%. If we do go back to pre 2021 cost levels, do we retain some portion of this price increase? And if so, why is that the case? Lori Ryerkerk : That seems like a very long time ago, Dave. What I would say is the good news is we are seeing volumes come back. And so in some areas, like medical, like auto, we are kind of back to 2019 levels. I think - so pricing similar, our margins probably similar. Again, consumer demand, durable goods, electronics, very, very soft. Pricing for differentiated grades, okay, I think that is something that we can keep I think with the kind of the current low demand and therefore, the long supply for some of those standard grades, we are going to need to see some more demand before we can get the pricing back up to those kind of levels. Scott Richardson : Yes. David, I would just add, I think given some of the structural changes that we are making, we do think we should be able to hold that price as we get back to kind of normalized raws. And I think one of the things we have talked about is now with the Engineered Materials business and the acetyls business being about the same size, as we see in more normalized demand environment, the raw material landscape move up and down, we should see some countermovement in margins in EM versus acetyl. So overall, it should kind of fundamentally lower earnings volatility for the enterprise as a whole once we get back into kind of normalized conditions. David Begleiter : Very good. And just on Clear Lake, the expansion for next year, how should we think about the ramp-up to the $100 million of normalized annualized earnings should be half of that next year in that range or something more or less? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, the Clear Lake asset expansion will start up within the first quarter. And so I would expect that ramp up to start kind of immediately after the startup. . Operator : Next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now live. Kevin McCarthy : Lori, I think in your prepared remarks, it mentioned that you ceased production at certain Engineered Materials facilities in Brazil, Argentina and Germany beyond the nylon shutdown that you discussed previously, can you just put that into context for us fairly clear on whether these are temporary idlings or more permanent structural changes. Maybe you could talk through kind of where you are in that asset rationalization process today. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I would say for the majority of the ones that we have named, so the ones in Argentina and Brazil and Europe, these are more permanent shutdowns. Now we are taking temporary actions in things like VAM in Frankfurt and others. We are really - we are using that as flex capacity to meet the current demands on the network, which is lower than normal, but where we will need that capacity when we come up again. But the ones we have announced recently, I would consider those structural changes to really redefine where we are on the cost curve by taking out our highest cost producers. Kevin McCarthy : Okay. That is helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on synergies. Can you tell us what the synergy-related benefit was in 3Q and what you are expecting in 4Q? And then when we look at the targeted tailwind of $150 million next year, would you describe that as ratable or ramping throughout the course of 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So Q3 was actually a little bit lower than we anticipated because some of our - I would say, at the lower end of the kind of 10% to 15% sequential uplift we had expected on synergies. Because with our volumes a little bit lower, some of our synergies are volume related. Again, we expect a sequential synergy increase in the fourth quarter. But the real synergies will start to come in after we do the completion of our cut over to SAP next year in the first quarter. And after we take some of the shutdowns that we announced, for example, the shutdowns and new growth that will happen in January and February. So the synergies will definitely ramp across 2024, but I would say starting more into the second quarter and through the end of the year. Scott Richardson : Yes, Kevin. In the third quarter, synergies were around $30 million in total, which was incrementally up about 10% 11% off of Q2. . Operator : Next question today is coming from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Your line is now live. Hassan Ahmed : Already in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about maximizing the make versus buy flexibility. I mean to me, the legacy sort of Celanese portfolio, you pretty much optimized that side of things. So is it fair to assume that a lot of this sort of optimization work will be on the EM side of it? So that is part one of the question. And the second part is that it seems that right now, there is a fair bit of idling or permanent shuttering going on. Could this also mean in the future some Greenfield build-outs happening as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Hassan. So what I would say is we are really focused on building the flexibility across all of our products. And so we are not just looking at make versus buy flexibility, but we are also looking at sourcing flexibility for raw material, regional flexibility, flexibility and contract commitments much as we did with tow. More multisourcing versus single sourcing. Specifically for PA66, yes, we want the flexibility to make versus buy, especially in this low demand period where we can often buy cheaper than we can make in Europe, in particular, because of higher energy costs and higher fixed costs, higher raws there. But I would say this has been a consistent theme in Celanese and one we are just now applying to the Heritage portfolio. So I think - but I would say we have also applied this and asked TILs some of our contracting around raw materials and others. I mean it is a way we continue to deliver value uplift year-on-year even without a large amount of volume growth. So I think we expect that to continue. And I think as a result of that, you will continue to see some footprint optimization continuing over the next few years. And I would say in terms of Greenfield, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any sign in the next many years, a lot of Greenfield builds. I think what you will continue to see us take advantage of the footprint we have and the opportunities to do no and low-cost debottlenecks around the world, much like the Clear Lake expansion, where we are basically doubling the size of our unit for $400 million. So we think we have a lot of opportunity already on the ground to significantly expand our footprint without major investments. Hassan Ahmed : Very fair. And just switching gears a little bit. Look, I completely sort of understand that visibility is extremely low right now. But just thinking beyond sort of the near term, I mean with some sort of historical context as well, I mean, this destock has been unprecedented, both in terms of absolute volume declines, as well as the ongoing duration of it. So just as you sort of sit there and look at the legacy Celanese portfolio as well as the history of living through these destocks with the acquired businesses, I mean what could a potential eventual restock look like? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, at some point, I think there will be some restocking when that happens, I would say, highly uncertain. Right now, we are just happy to see people starting to return to normal order patterns in some polymers in particular. I think as TILs we are seeing more I think I would think about restocking as being a few percent. But again, I think that could be spread across a pretty significant period as I think people will be nervous to rapidly raise stock after what we have been through the last year. Operator : Next question is coming from Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Aleksey Yefremov : I wanted to return to the M&Ms synergies in your 2024 bridge. The $150 million improvement, does it depend on volume improvement or demand improvement or is it independent of it? Lori Ryerkerk : So the $150 million, what I would say is, look, initially, I would say there was some volume improvement in that because some of the synergies are volume related. I think that is why you see us continuing to accelerate some of our manufacturing footprint work to better align current demand with our supply, and we will get synergies from there. So I would say we are fully committed to delivering well over the $150 million this year. The blend may be slightly different than we had set out, say, a year ago at the time of the deal. But we think we have sufficient activities underway to deliver that. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks, Lori. And then staying with EM, you just announced shutdown of some assets. Have you seen the industry and your peers either idle or announced permanent shutdown on some maybe significant polymer chains? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think if we look at the industry, probably specifically PA66 is where we have seen the most activity. We have seen some additional capacity being built out in Asia, particularly in China for nylon Polymer, which has increased market length in a period of lower demand. And therefore, we have had some increased competition, depressed pricing you have seen all those impacts. I think what you see, though, is much like our shutdown, we start to see other industry participants take action. So we have seen a nylon intermediate producer announced a shutdown of one of their largest assets here in the last month, which represents about 10% of the intermediate production. So I think you see the intermediate using this as an opportunity to take out some of the legacy higher-cost assets and different parts of the world that have become quite high cost and work towards rebalancing. Again, when demand returns, I think we will be in a much better position, but I do think you have seen a number of commercial actions going on across the industry to address that. Operator : Next question is coming from Frank Mitsch from him Fermium Research. Your line is now live. Frank Mitsch : Maybe if I could ask the destock question a little differently. You mentioned in the release the prepared remarks that you are seeing it end here in the fourth quarter in the Americas and Asia, that will continue in Europe. What gives you the confidence that we are going to be finally done in the Americas and Asia and such that 2024, we are going to see underlying demand growth in those regions? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think our confidence really comes from, obviously, conversations with our distributors and our direct customers as well. but also just the buying patterns we are seeing in the U.S. I mean, we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into future purchasing because what we are finding is when now, especially in the Americas, when people want to buy, they want it now. Would suggest to us that they are fully destocked because they don\u2019t have inventory in their chain that they can pull on. . And I think in the U.S. at least, we are starting to see some recovery, especially in those areas that have been weak like consumer durables, electronics, to maybe more normal demand patterns. So I think it is the customer buying patterns that I would trigger off of to say we feel pretty confident that we are at the end of destocking in the U.S. I would say less so in China. China, I would describe as consumer demand in China for China is - come back to, I would say, near normal levels. But obviously, China export volumes are still very weak, which is a significant portion of the China demand. And then in Europe, I would just say, outside of auto, we really just don\u2019t see any improvement in Europe as I think consumer confidence remains very low in light of the War in the Ukraine and higher energy prices and higher inflation. We are just not seeing that behavior start to pick up in Europe, yes. Frank Mitsch : Got you. That is very helpful. And then the early look at 2024 suggests that there is a bunch of onetime cost actions that you took in 2023 that will not be repeated, so that should set up an easier comp. I\u2019m just curious if you could kind of quantify or provide an order of magnitude of that and perhaps if plant turnarounds also play a role in some expectations for 2024 to be better than 2023. Any color there would be very helpful. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think we had called out a couple of quarters ago, $60 million to $80 million of onetime actions that we were taking this year to really offset some of the softness we were seeing in the second quarter. And we are achieving those across third quarter and fourth quarter. What I would say is those are really related to actions we have taken to idle lines to cut costs out of facilities that aren\u2019t running full. . If demand does not pick up. Obviously, we will continue to realize those benefits next year as well. if demand picks up, we will be more than happy to spend that money again in order to capture the margin that will come from the increased demand. So I don\u2019t see that as a big factor either way in our bridge from 2023 to 2024 because we will either get it in earnings or we will continue to see it as cost savings. Scott Richardson : Yes, Frank, and I would say our focus is really on now actioning other things that are going to be more permanent in nature, given some of the things we called out in the prepared comments, so we can make kind of more sustainable cost reductions and really the lower the overall fixed cost base of the company. And that then gives us an ability to withstand lower demand environment in the future and get much greater leverage on the fixed cost that we have. Operator : Next question is coming from the Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Arun Viswanathan : So I\u2019m just looking at the bridge for 2024 and again, obviously, [indiscernible] Never questions have been asked here. But if we think about Q3 EBITDA around $625 million in Q4, looking a little bit similar from your segment commentary makeup. You are exiting the year at maybe like a $2.5 billion run rate you have maybe $100 million coming from the AC uplift and then $150 million from incremental synergies and then maybe a couple of other items, including the lack of an inventory hit. So that puts us at maybe $2.8 billion or between $2.8 billion and $3 billion. Are we thinking about that correctly as far as EBITDA goes. And is volume the main driver that would push you above that range? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. We have called out what those factors are, I would say, the big unknown at this point remains demand and pricing, particularly raw material, which, as we have seen this year, can cause quite a lot of volatility. Hopefully, we will be able to give a better guidance next quarter. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe I can just ask one on the balance sheet. So obviously, a lot of progress there as well as restructuring the debt profile and redomiciling. Do you expect any other further opportunities there? And I guess, could you just reiterate what your target leverage level is maybe as you exit 2024? Scott Richardson : Yes, Arun, I mean our focus right now has continued to accelerate cash generation and aggressively repay debt. We have obviously moved the maturities out since we last talked a quarter ago. But certainly, now our focus is on bringing down overall net debt. We are going to be focused on repatriating cash and using that cash to reduce debt. And then with the cash generation, we should - next year, between repatriation, cash gen, we should be able to reduce debt by almost $2 billion net debt reduction, certainly well north of $1 billion. So I think from that standpoint, that is where the focus is today. We don\u2019t have a need really to adjust maturities or refinance. Certainly, if markets change, we will be opportunistic around that. But we are going to continue to focus on every single quarter marching down and bringing our leverage levels down with a target to get to three times as quickly as possible. Operator : Next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Laurence Alexander : When you think about kind of the improving the productivity in the Acetyls through shrinking capacity and I guess, also it is parts of EM. If you think about the next three, four-years, if there is no significant surge in demand. How much of your capacity could be optimized or rationalized through shifting through process improvements at your larger facilities and debottlenecking and upgrading the network? In other words, how far are we in this upgrading process? And at what point would you need to start considering just sort of new Greenfield projects? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Let me take them as two separate. I would say on Acetyls, we have done a lot of work over many years now to really reduce the number of facilities that we have. And really have larger, very efficient facilities strategically located regionally. And our activities, including the big expansion at Clear Lake, but we have also had many, many small expansions in many of our downstream derivatives to basically keep us at the same or greater volumes and certainly much higher margins as a result. I would say we have also done that work in the Heritage EM portfolio over the last, call it, 10-years as we adopted the new models and the project pipeline models and you have seen a lot of those actions in the announcements we have made over the last 10-years. I think now for us, that is now taking the M&M portfolio and applying that same mindset to that. So I don\u2019t really have a number yet what that means in terms of capacity that we would take out. Again, I don\u2019t really see any time in the near to medium future any need for Greenfield because we have sufficient capacity even with some of the strategic shutdowns in our existing network, and we have a team that is exceptionally good at finding low and no cost debottlenecks to our existing assets to add very efficiently and inexpensively additional capacity. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Salvador Tiano from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Salvador Tiano : Yes. Firstly, I want to ask a little bit, as you said, the shutdowns in Engineered Materials are a big part of the $150 million synergies. So I\u2019m just wondering where do these actions in your original plans when you acquired the upon assets or were they more, I guess in response to recent market conditions. And I guess if the latter, why will the synergy target increase given that this will be incremental actions? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, great question. Look, we knew at the time of the acquisition or we believed at the time of the acquisition that DuPont had more than sufficient capacity to meet normal demand conditions and requirements. And we assume that some would be more efficient or less efficient than others, we just didn\u2019t know which assets those would be. So we have needed this time we have had since the acquisition to really look at how all of these plants are operating what their cost structures look like and where the most opportunities are to really fine-tune our footprint to build in the most flexibility, the most synergy, the lowest cost footprint, like I said, much as we have done with Celanese over the last 10-years. So the actions you are seeing us taking now is really addressing that overcapacity now that we have been able to identify where that is. Some of the temporary shutdowns and line shutdowns and things were taken are more in response to the near-term demand environment, leaving the flexibility for the future. But the things like [indiscernible] Nitro and Argentina and those that we have announced, they are more permanent in nature. Salvador Tiano : Okay. Perfect. And I also would like to ask a little bit about your Q4 guidance and assessments. I think there is a lot of the questions regarding what the demand destruction in the stock installing, et cetera. But I think the what makes, I guess, your outlook a little bit different than most of the companies that have reported so far is that you made the comment, if I understood correctly, you expect a more muted destocking in Q4 than normal, whereas I would say the vast majority of your competitors expect the same, if not a more intense stocking quarter? Why do you differ versus, I guess, most of the other chemical companies here? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I mean I can\u2019t really comment on what anybody else believe is going to happen. As I called out earlier, we based our views on what we are hearing from our customers, what we are hearing from our distributors, big customer order patterns that we are seeing in our experience with those order patterns. Certainly, it helps that half of our volume in engineered material is going into automotive, and we expect automotive to be quite solid across Q3 to Q4. So we are really just dealing with the other portions of our demand when we are looking at what is the impact for the fourth quarter. So again, I can\u2019t really say why it would be different. But certainly, our share of auto may be one of those impacts. Operator : Next question today is coming from Andrew Keches from Barclays. Your line is now live. Andrew Keches : Just to clarify the comment earlier on the debt repayment. So it sounds like you said cash flow will be used to handle the maturities now that you have reprofiled. But that excess cash you are running, can you just remind us where your operating needs are? And can you get all the way down there in 2024? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Cash balance is a little north of $1.3 billion right now, and we will be repatriating that cash now in the coming months. And then once we get integrated on 1 system, which we expect to happen in the early part of next year, then we will be able to start moving that cash balance down to where we think we can - minimum needs would be right around $500 million. So we definitely are confident that we will be able to get to that $500 million level during 2024. Andrew Keches : Okay. Great. And then I just didn\u2019t catch the answer on the leverage metric. I know you said three times in the past. Are you putting a horizon or a time line on that at this point? Scott Richardson : No. I mean, look, we had originally targeted the end of 2024, and we are going to do everything we can to get close to that. And last quarter, we said may bleed into the early part of 2025, a lot just depends upon what happens with our cost reduction plans, which is another reason why we continue to take aggressive action on getting controllable earnings improvement from cost reduction and then where the macro and the demand plans that we have. The other things that teams are doing, largely in Engineered Materials is really working the revenue synergy side. And the revenue synergy side of bringing M&M into our project pipeline model, will start to yield opportunities and close wins as we get further into 2024. So the pace and speed at which we are able to execute on those plans will certainly help us accelerate that deleveraging plan. Operator : Next question is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is now live. Patrick Cunningham : How are you thinking about potential portfolio actions, let\u2019s say, if demand does not get better from here? Is there anything that maybe stands out as separable or where you can structure a similar deal as the Food Ingredients JV? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think as we have called out in past calls, we are going to continue to be opportunistic and disciplined in our approach to divestment. We continue to look at a number of assets from both the heritage Celanese as well as the M&M portfolio as possible divestiture target. But we really need to understand what the future potential of those assets are and what the value to us is and then identify other parties that will value them more than we value them. So I would say we continue to look for opportunities, but we will be selective about what we do, so it doesn\u2019t impact long-term growth as well as making sure we get fair value for it. Patrick Cunningham : Got it. And then just on the Eco [indiscernible] CC brand with products containing recycled CO2. What sort of relative premiums do you expect to achieve? And would you be fulfilling incremental demand there, or is that more of just optionality with the rest of the portfolio? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think you have said it best in terms of optionality. We actually started that project just on credit, and it was justified based just on additional methanol for use in Clear Lake and really the cost advantage of make versus buy for methanol on an average basis. So that was the justification for the project. Since the time we started the project, obviously, markets have continued to develop for more sustainable products for lower carbon footprint products. And we do believe for certain that there will be a premium that will be available for more sustainable products. I would say not so much, I don\u2019t anticipate we will be in the biomethanol market. Our intent is to take that methanol and further convert it into lower carbon downstream derivatives. So they lower carbon - acetic acid, lower carbon BAM or carbon BAE, lower carbon, palm and other polymers. And that is really where we think the advantage is as end users will see more value in being able to have low carbon. So think of it simply as be able to, through this project, put CO2 in the paint on your wall, that would otherwise would\u2019ve been into the atmosphere. I mean, that is where we see the premium coming is from people who want to have that impact on their environmental footprint. Operator : Next question is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Your line is now live. Jaideep Pandya : The first question is really on the nylon chain. There is a lot of upstream capacity in monomers and polymers coming in Asia. So could you just tell us like maybe on a fundamental basis, how do you add value in your nylon sort of portfolio? And in the long run, why would you actually want to be more in the polymerization. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to be more downstream asset-light use this capacity that is coming in Asia and create more product differentiation. That is my first question. And then on the Acetyl side, there is capacity, again coming in China, some of the plants have been laid this year and ramping into next year. So how do you see demand supply balance in acid and VAM next year? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks for the question. As I said earlier, we do see the polymerization capacity and some intermediate capacity coming on stream in China. We have seen some other industry shutdowns going on. But we remain really excited about PA66. Again, a lot of what\u2019s coming on is polymer. A lot of the value is adding in compounding. A lot of our PA66 goes into highly differentiated products, where we are the sole suppliers. And we see a lot of future potential for PA66 in EV, for example, uniquely to EVs lately, we have had applications for battery cell frames and in-place, high-voltage connector, brackets and mounts for electric motors. So we see the EVs continuing to extend to the extent that we see some moderation in EV production. We think that will be in favor of hybrids and hybrids have even more PA66 content. So that is only a good thing for us. And then if you look at the next five-years, we also see electricity demand more than doubling, partly driven by EVs, but also driven by the electrification of everything. And there will be a strong pull on PA66 for that in building out electrical infrastructure. But again, you don\u2019t tend to be integrate materials. These tend to be highly differentiated. They need fire retardants, they need all sorts of different things. And that is where we really see the value being added is in the differentiation achieved through compounding. And look, we always want the flexibility to make versus buy because we do see these markets swing because of outages and other things going on. So this is really about building more optionality into this chain in a way that M&M didn\u2019t have because they had a very cumbersome take-or-pay. They have a lot of overcapacity, they had single sourcing. We have been systematically resolving these issues so that we will have a flexible and highly optional PA66 chain where we think we can achieve significant value uplift. Brandon Ayache : Kevin, we will take the next question is our last one, please. Operator : Our final question today is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is now live. John Roberts : After the start-up of Clear Lake BAM in early 2024, do you have the option of permanently closing the VAM unit in Frankfurt or you need to maintain some optionality and flexibility by only doing temporary closures. And excluding any onetime upfront cost, is there a significant cost difference between a permanent closure in operating Frankfurt and the stop and start mode? Scott Richardson : Yes, John, we are building a new acetic acid plant in Clear Lake on a BAM unit. So we did the expansion in Clear Lake and BAM a number of years ago. So we feel really good about our current network in BAM. John Roberts : And do you think the prolonged Delrin divestment process contributed to some of the weakness in the Engineered Materials market? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Hard to say, but I don\u2019t - we haven\u2019t really seen that that has been an impact at all in terms of impacting the pulp market. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Brandon for any further closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thank you, Kevin. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we are around for any follow-up questions that you have. Kevin, please go ahead and close the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Celanese Q4 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Brandon Ayache, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Brandon. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, Kevin. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. My name is Brandon Ayache, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Kyrish, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its fourth quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements which can be found at the end of both the press release and the prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. With that, Kevin, let's go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Josh Spector from UBS. Joshua Spector : I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for the M&M business in 2024 and kind of both near term and longer term. So in the first quarter, you seem to call out some improvement. I'm not really sure if that's an assumption of market improvement or price cost improvement in earnings. So I wanted to clarify that. And then second, kind of how do you layer on the cost savings versus market and everything else where you expect to exit the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. If we look at first quarter, we do expect a really meaningful lift in M&M earnings in the first quarter and in fact, expect first quarter to be our highest quarterly EBITDA since the acquisition. I think that's a number of things. The biggest factor is really starting to see the pull through of lower raw materials and lower fixed costs that we were generating this year but needed to move the volume through, that's the higher cost materials through inventory. So I'd say that's over half of the improvement we expect to see in the first quarter. We do expect recovery in auto versus the seasonal destocking that we experienced in the fourth quarter which was an issue for M&M. And then we start to see some of the initial fixed cost improvements from the footprint optimizations that we initiated last year and announced, although I would expect those to become more meaningful in the second half of the year and actually into next year as well. And so we do see evidence for that is we are seeing variable margin improving in January as we start to see that inventory pull through of lower raws and fixed costs. So we feel pretty confident in that. And for some key areas like Zytel, we saw that really bottom for fourth quarter, and we're starting to see the recovery there. So I'd say we feel good about the first quarter and the meaningful uplift that we'll have in M&M next year as well. Fundamentally, I would say we continue to see M&M as a really great business. All the reasons that we bought it are still there. We have just been a very difficult backdrop that has made it hard to get the full value of the synergies as well as some of the volume recovery and growth that we had counted on. I think if you looked at it today in what would be a more normal demand backdrop, we would find that M&M would be accretive. Operator : Next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Lori, I think you completed an SAP implementation just a few weeks ago. Can you comment on how that's going so far, kind of level of integration across the company? And remind us of what the benefits might be as your TSAs roll off? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. So we did do our SAP integration, the last version of that went live February 1. Maybe I should actually start out by thanking the over 1,600 people in the organization who have worked on the SAP integration, not full time, obviously, but had some role in it. And really, we often think about SAP integration as an IT effort, but it's really a full business effort, including the finance, customer service, commercial businesses. It goes across everybody. And our folks have worked very hard to make this a success in only 15 months after we did the integration, which I think is fast by any standard. And then after they had already integrated the heritage Celanese businesses earlier last year onto the same SAP S/4 platform. So really excited to get this done. I would say this is probably the last major step in our integration. And will really help us now as we keep layering on the various processes to the platform, will really help us achieve the next level of synergy including getting rid of the TSA from DuPont, but also the synergies of people being able to work together on one platform, being able to have better access to the data et cetera. I'd say the integration went very smoothly. So supply chain production are all on the new platform running well. We're able to take an order. We're able to produce the chip in order and we're able to get paid for an order. So that was the first order of business. And now we're gearing up for our first month and close on the new platform. But again, I think it's been remarkably smooth, great kudos to the extended team that made that happen. And I'd say so far on the integration, we've seen no surprises. Kevin McCarthy : And then secondly, if I may, can you comment on your input cost outlook for 2024? And if those costs trended flat from here, what sort of benefit or tailwind might we expect for this year? Lori Ryerkerk : So I would say, I mean, if you're talking about raw material costs, I mean, certainly, raws have come down versus where we were a year ago. And who knows what will happen, but we also know that we are now pulling through the lower cost of raw and lower fixed costs that we built on. I would say '24 is very much a year of being able to deliver on the actions that were taken in '23. And so I think that is built in, obviously, to our outlook for the year. I think the important thing that we're focused on, and we've talked about all year, is we want to continue to control what's controllable. At Celanese, we're really good at execution. I think you see that with what we've done so far. All of the projects we were able to take on at the same time. And so really, as we move into '24, we see the benefits of that execution in '23 as well as all the steps we have in '24. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : You said that the synergies in the M&M business would be $150 million. Does that mean that the adjusted EBIT growth in M&M should be at least $150 million in 2024 year-over-year? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Jeff. No, because a number of factors there. So the synergies we're expecting for this year is $150 million, only about 40% of those actually show up in M&M. The vast majority of them do show up in the EM profile, but some of them also show up in BU other and other areas. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Maybe to reframe it a different way. Do you expect the M&M business to grow its EBIT exclusive of the synergies? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So yes, thank you. I probably misunderstood your first question. We do expect growth across both our heritage EM businesses and a significant uplift in M&M businesses even exclusive of synergies for the year. I mean if you think about our outlook for the year of $11 to $12 and think about, we call out $100,000 -- sorry, $100 million more in acetyls, the remainder of the uplift from the $9 we were at this year really comes from that integrated EM business. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Just wondering if you could help bridge us from 1Q to the remaining quarters? I know there seems to be a lot more headwinds in Q1, more of the synergies and everything, all the positives are coming in 2Q to 3Q. So when you think about going from $2 to a lot higher in the remaining three quarters and how does that sort of happen? And then, are the last three quarters basically equal in EPS is kind of the way to look at it? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. The way I look at it is, if we look at what we're expecting to achieve in Q1, if you do the math, it says we need 300 to 340 in each of the remaining quarters. I would expect that to ramp up more in the second half, but I would still expect a pretty good ramp in the second quarter as well. So think about it this way. You don't have the turnarounds in Q2 that you had in Q1. So that's a $50 million lift. And then in EM, the vast majority of the additional lift in that quarter comes from EM and it's really synergies and flow-through of lower cost inventory. It's returning too. We have some seasonality in medical is always low in the first quarter, that should come back in the second quarter. Then in AC, you start to see the benefits of the project as we move through the second quarter. So I would say, we do expect a significant uplift in Q2 but even more uplift in Q3 and Q4. I would expect Q3 to be the highest quarter because we would expect some seasonality again in Q4. Michael Sison : Got it. And then as a quick follow-up. Several companies have impaired assets from acquisitions over the last couple of years. Now I know M&M has underperformed, but are there any parts from M&M close to that in terms of impairment levels? And if so, what are the areas? Scott Richardson : Yes, Mike. We'll look at that when that time comes. We've taken a look at that at the EM level and have not seen markers on that, that would cause us at this point in time. I think that's a possibility. Operator : Next question is coming from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Lori, just on a high-level basis, what sort of global macroeconomic backdrop are you embedding as it relates to your guidance? Obviously, interest rates are still high. ISM, very mix globally, China, who knows. It still sounds that like there's pockets of destocking, et cetera, on the durable goods side. How do you sort of factor all that in as it relates to the evolution in 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I would say, at this stage, we are really focused on what we can control. So what we\u2019ve assumed in our $11 to $12 guide is we see the kind of the diminishing of destocking. So we are assuming that we are getting to the destocking. We are not though assuming a really big uptick in demand or restocking. So I would say we're still assuming kind of below normal demand patterns, but without the destocking. So we are -- that is kind of the one upside that we're assuming. That's maybe a few percent at the most. And otherwise, it's really -- our outlook is really focused on what we can control. I would say if we look at the market, I mean, good news is, I think, as we're starting '24 although I'd like to say we're back in normal demand patterns, we're not. But look, we are starting to see some easing of some of the demand and competitive challenges we had. We called out, we're seeing less movement in materials out of Asia into Europe. So that indicates to us that local demand is improving in China. And we see that. I would say in China, generally, we feel like demand for China consumption is approaching normal order patterns and normal levels. But the exports of goods out of China is still depressed, especially into Europe. So there's still some downside on demand there. I think in the Americas, we're seeing demand come back gradually. We saw some improvement in Industrial in the fourth quarter, but then we saw the reduction in auto, which was seasonal destocking. I expect that to come back in the first quarter. But again, not anticipating a huge uptick in demand there for consumer goods and electronics. In Europe, I'd say, similar to the U.S., but probably even a longer time frame and before we could return to demand. I mean, the other thing I would add though is, look, we are seeing some improvement in construction kind of normalizing. So that's good, and that's supported by a slight movement upward in terms of VAM pricing as well. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Super helpful. And then for the second question, the outages in 2024 that seem front-end loaded, but would those bulk just sort of pull forward just given weaker demand? Or was that sort of in line with the original plan? Lori Ryerkerk : No, I'd say it's very much in line with the original plan. In fact, a little bit, we've pushed back a little out of '23 into '24 with the delay in the project at Clear Lake. But I would say these are planned turnarounds. These are turnarounds that occur on an every three years in the case of VAM, four years in case of methanol. And so very much as planned. And I would also say they've gone very well. We've gotten through all the major discovery work and no surprises. So feel like we're on track to meet our plans around those turnarounds. Operator : Your next question is coming from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Ryan Weis : This is Ryan on for Aleksey. The first question, I wanted to dig into a little bit on nylon pricing. I believe at least one peer of yours is out in the market, announcing some pricing. Are you seeing any momentum of it here? And can you just talk about what your expectations might be for the balance of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, nylon pricing varies a lot depending by region or by end use. But I would say, in general, we feel like we hit kind of the bottom in terms of variable margins. So it's not just pricing that's important, but it's raws as well, so raws have come down. But I'd say, in general, we feel like we're coming off the bottom. But let me hand it over to Scott, because I think he can give a bit more color here. Scott Richardson : No. I think Lori hit it, Ryan. We are seeing a lot of stability, which is a really good thing. And as Lori mentioned, we're starting to see the flow-through of variable costs. So margins are expanding in the nylon business, and we continue to work, as we said in previous quarters, to get back some of that share that had been lost prior to us closing the transaction. So we feel good about the trajectory as we work our way through this year of the nylon business. Ryan Weis : Great. That's very helpful. And then if I could just dig a little bit into the $150 million synergy target in your bridge for '24. If there's no demand improvement, demand kind of trend sideways from here. Do you still feel you're confident in being able to deliver on that target? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So I feel really confident in our ability to deliver on that $150 million. I think if you look at it, it really is in three buckets. The first really be the footprint optimization steps that we've taken at the end of this year, would start to show up in the bottom line next year. So that's probably about $50 million in the year. We have the transition to the single SAP platform, which is happening now which gets us out of the TSA and we get other synergies from. And then we have cross-sell opportunities which have been identified this year, closed one this year, which will start to come online next year, and we'll start to see the revenue return from. So I feel very confident about that $150 million of synergies for 2024. Operator : Next question is coming from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Frank Mitsch : If I could just follow up, did you guys disclose what your M&M synergies were realized for 2023? Apologies if I missed that. Lori Ryerkerk : I'm not sure if we disclose it or not, but we achieved $100 million in synergies in 2023. A little bit lower than we had anticipated earlier in the year, but still above what we had thought at the beginning of the year. And really, the reason for that was the volume related, just not seen volume recovery and some of the volume-related synergies not pulling through. But again, those synergies are there, they will just pull through at a later time as volumes recover. Frank Mitsch : Got you. Understood. Understood. And if I could, a question on the acetyls chain. I know back in the '21 Investor Day, back when you had acetate split out, the expectation was that it was going to be relatively flat to '21 during 2023, at $245 million of EBIT. I suspect it might have been higher than that. Can you give us an idea as to how well that part of the business is performing and what outlook is? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, acetate tow had a really good year this year as a result of the work we did last year to really reset how we contracted and how we manage that business. As you'll recall, we pulled it in to be part of the acetyl chain to give us more flexibility and more optionality much like we do for the rest of our projects. So I would say we called out our target was to get to the $245 million at Investor Day. I would say we have meaningfully exceeded that target for the year. But again, I think the important thing here is we are just running as part of the chain. And that way, we stabilize the earnings of the entire acetyl chain, much like we do with say redispersible powders and other downstream derivatives. It simply gives us another outlet to pull acetic acid through the chain to make sure we can maximize value from the chain and again, stabilize earnings. Operator : Your next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Turner Hendriks] on for Vincent. I was wondering if you could provide your updated view on auto builds for 2024 and the impact of slowing EV sales on product mix in EM and M&M? Also, how is opposed to China autos is the combined EM and M&M business? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks, Turner. First, let me start with auto builds. I think the industry, most publications are projecting somewhere more or less flattish build. Our business tends to grow about 150 basis points to 200 basis points above build. So that's what we're baking into our current plan. When it comes to the mix of EVs, we're largely across our EM portfolio, pretty agnostic to whether it's an EV, an ICE vehicle or honestly, hybrids are the best. And we have about 20% more accessible content on a hybrid vehicle. So starting, particularly here in the U.S. to see more shifts to hybrid that tends to be a good thing for us overall. So really no impact if we see the mix impact here in the U.S. change away from EVs and move back to ICE or to hybrid. And from a China perspective, overall, if you kind of start at the corporate level, it's about 1/4 of our overall sales. You bring that down into EM pretty similar. And our overall exposure is kind of around that range as well in terms of automotive in China. Unidentified Analyst : Of the lower raw materials cost in nylon, how significant is this expected to be in 2024? And what's the confidence that these will not get passed through to price? Scott Richardson : I think, as Lori mentioned, we have a bucket of the lower variable and fixed cost we think is going to flow through the earnings. That could be the largest year-over-year benefit for us. A good chunk of that is in the nylon part of the M&M portfolio. So it has the ability to be a pretty significant driver of uplift year-over-year. A lot will depend upon what happens with raw materials as well as pricing in the second half of the year. We feel good about where things are in the first half of the year, given the amount of inventory that we have in the order book as we see it. Pricing, as we said earlier, has kind of bottomed out in nylon. So we don't expect to see a lot of pricing impact downward from where it is today. So we feel very confident that the margins we're seeing right now here, at least in the first half are here to stay. Operator : Our next question is coming from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Lori, can you talk to the foundational level of earnings in acetyls post the Clear Lake expansion coming on stream and given the step-up in acetate tow earnings we've seen this year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, it's pretty simple. I mean we're -- we said foundational level of earnings is $1.3 billion today. I think we've proved that in 2023 and what we're pretty sub-foundational markets for most of the year. And next year, we expect -- or this year, I should say, we expect that to increase by $100 million, which is really what we expect to get in productivity from the combination of Panther and our CCU project, Panther being, sorry, the Clear Lake acetic acid expansion. David Begleiter : And have you assumed some normalized level of steal demand, what could our earnings power be? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, I mean, look, we've had years where we were over $2 billion in acetyls. So I mean, when we have fly-ups and those sorts of things because the supply outages or sudden demand increases, it can be very high. But again, right now, we're focused on what we can control. And so I would focus on that 1.4 level of foundational earnings. David Begleiter : And one more thing. Just on the tax rate, is 9% a good rate going beyond 2024? Chuck Kyrish : Hey, David, this is Chuck. For 2024, we do expect a really similar rate to '23. I'd use 9% for now for that, and we will update you if that changes. Going forward, we feel like we're in a good position. It will depend on the jurisdictional mix of our earnings. And we'll update that each year, but we feel like we're in a pretty good position where we are right now. Operator : Our next question is coming from Arun Viswanathan from RBC. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And apologies for that earlier. I guess, first off, just on the deleveraging trajectory. I know that the target obviously is to get to 3 turns as rapidly as possible. Maybe you can just walk us through the opportunity on free cash flow and how you expect to get to that returns? Is there any more opportunity to harvest a little bit more free cash flow to working capital? Or yes, maybe we can start with that. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Let me ask Chuck to cover the details. But what I would say is, this year, like we were last year, we were very focused on generation of free cash flow and deleveraging. We're very committed to maintaining that investment grade. And so we are anxious to delever to that 3x level so that we will have flexibility in our use of capital going forward and be able to move on with other opportunities in the company. But Chuck, let me you walk through the bucket. Chuck Kyrish : Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Lori. Thanks, Arun. First, I want to just thank the global teams that we have that drove the record free cash results in '23. That's a lot of work by a lot of smart people. So I just want to salute that for your efforts. You know who you are out there. For '24, let me give you a few key drivers that we're seeing for free cash flow right now. If we start with earnings, if you take our EPS guide, that would translate into about $300 million of incremental net income, give or take. On working capital, our target for '24 is $100 million to $150 million benefit for the year. This compares with a little over $500 million cash benefit for the year in '23. So not as much working capital benefit year-over-year, but we're still striving for working capital benefit within the year. And this driver could change depending on how demand shapes up across '24, of course, and kind of how earnings and synergies ramp. And we do know CapEx should be lower year-over-year by $100 million to $150 million as we cycle out of a lot of large projects. Those are the key drivers. There are some other puts and takes in that, that we need to refine as the year goes on like cash tax and cost to achieve synergies. But I would focus on key drivers right now in '24. And as you know, we are really focused on converting our earnings into cash flow, deleveraging the balance sheet. We think we're going to finish this year much closer to our 3x target and we expect to finish to our 3x target in 2025. Arun Viswanathan : Great. And then I just have one quick follow-up. Just thinking about the portfolio as it stands now. Obviously, you've gone through some changes within the food ingredients and integrating M&M. Is there anything else on the horizon that we should be thinking about as far as portfolio management or potential divestitures or anything along those lines? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Thanks, Arun. Look, we still have a ways to go with the acquisition of M&M and the cleanup activities. I think as we get through S/4, this is a big milestone for us and will allow us to find other opportunities to better run these businesses together. So that is kind of first and foremost, our focus. But I would also say, as it comes to divestitures, we will, as we've always been, be opportunistic and smart about it. And if we see the opportunity to divest something in the company that is it worth that more to someone else than it is to us, we will, of course, pursue that. Operator : Next question today is coming from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : A two-part question on the acetyl chain to start with. Your margins in Q4 sequentially were flat to even slightly up, which was a bit surprise, keeping in mind what the acetic acid to methanol spread did. So part one of the question is how did you achieve that margin expansion? And then as I sort of sit there and think about 2023 for acetic, there seems to have been quite a few industry outages, which I would imagine you guys benefited from. So as you, guys, sort of gave us that bridge to 2024 earnings, you're talking about a $50 million to $75 million headwind from one-offs. Is the positive impact of sort of those outages baked into that as well? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks for the question, Hassan. Let me start by really kind of committing the team for continuing to flex this integrated value chain model. What you saw in the fourth quarter is a combination of the team flexing production as much as possible given some of the outages that were unexpected in the Americas and flexing that to the highest value end uses that we saw and to our teams in the field and the manufacturing environment really pulling costs down as much as possible, given the economic environment that we're in. As you alluded to, some of those reverse out as we move our way into next year. But I think we do expect the markets to grow kind of in that global GDP level in the acetyl value chain, which will give us some potential offset to any kind of industry outages that may or may not happen. We are expecting utilization to remain in kind of the 85% to 90% range. So much like you saw last year, if you see some dislocation in markets, we tend to be able to benefit from that in the short term. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful, Scott. And as a follow-up on the sort of M&M side of things. You, guys, obviously shut down some nylon capacity. So if you could sort of talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of near- to medium-term supply-demand fundamentals on nylon. And part and parcel with that, in the last quarter, you guys talked about maximizing your make versus buy decision? What's the thought process in light of what you're seeing in terms of nylon supply-demand fundamentals on the make versus buy as well? Scott Richardson : Our focus is creating a contemporary operating model for nylon. Not relying on low-cost raw materials to create value. But controlling where that value creation comes from. And for us, that really comes from creating compounds that are unique for our customers and maximizing that part of the value chain as much as possible. We have the ability, given where the dynamics are to make some of those make first buy decisions, as you mentioned earlier, Hassan. And as we do that, we're going to be focused, much like we do in the acetyl chain, on what is the lowest cost to supply those compounds so we can remain competitive. But fundamentally, we are working to create a business model here that is minimum of 25% EBITDA in any economic environment. And so the first steps of that to take controllable costs out with the shutdown of our production capacity in Europe and then maximize our low-cost capacities that we have here in the Americas as well as purchases in Asia. Operator : Next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Laurence Alexander : Can you clarify the EBITDA impact from incentive comp and working capital flows in 2023 and therefore, the bridge to 2024? Lori Ryerkerk : Sorry, I was just having a little trouble hearing your question. In 2023, we reduced inventory by about $450 million. Of that, 80% came from EM. The rest came from AC. And what I would say, it was punitive to our EBIT for the year. At the same time, our businesses did a really great job offsetting the impacts of that as well as minimizing it and making sure we took some reductions in raw materials and intermediates and things that didn't have as much of an EBITDA impact. Laurence Alexander : Okay. Great. And just in terms of the incentive comp 2024 versus 2023. Is it an incremental headwind? Lori Ryerkerk : I would -- for the inventory reductions, which will be less this year, I would expect a similar level of EBITDA hit for that. So I don't see that as being a year-on-year headwind. Scott Richardson : Yes. And on incentive comp, Laurence, we don't -- I wouldn't expect it to be material year-over-year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Salvator Tiano from Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : Thank you very much. So first question I wanted to ask on the acetyl chain. It seems like you're assuming acetic acid and VAM and acetyl spreads probably will be flat year-on-year. So the growth will come from the Clear Lake expansion. What are you seeing on the supplies because it feels that the supply comes online in China in 2024, could this actually be an additional risk? And if the acid prices do come down, that is not part of the $11 to $12 guidance? Scott Richardson : Yes. So thanks for your question. Let me try to answer it. You put out on us a few times here. Let me first kind of hit what Lori talked about earlier around the $100 million really coming through productivity on a year-over-year basis. As we mentioned earlier on the call, we would expect to see growth more in line with GDP, so low single digits. There, given what we're seeing kind of right now in the construction sector, as Lori talked about earlier. That's kind of going to be offset by some of the outages that we had earlier in the year. So I would not focus too much on changes in utilization. The industry has more or less kind of already absorbed that new capacity that has come online in China. So really think about the year-over-year lift coming from our productivity projects. Lori Ryerkerk : And maybe if I could add just a little bit more color on that. If you actually look at, say, China acid pricing through the year, it was actually very steady throughout the year, except for a very short lift that we saw at the end of Q3 based on some outages in the industry. But that was very short-lived and really went away as we went through, got into the fourth quarter. So I would say we saw capacity come online. Last year as well, more capacity last year than it's going to come online, and that's already been absorbed, and we're still at that 85% to 90% utilization. So while there may be some additions in '24, it is much smaller than we experienced in '23, and we didn't really see the '23 capacity adds have a long-term impact on pricing. Salvator Tiano : Okay. Perfect. And for my follow-up, I want to ask a little bit about the Red Sea disruptions and assuming that may disrupt Asia to Europe trade close, how could this impact Celanese these earnings, especially in Europe? I guess, I could see this being posted in regard to lower nylon or POM imports. But at the same time, it could affect the imports of some of the raw material sides. So what would be the impact, you think? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes, I'm not sure that there'll be any benefit at this point in time. What I would say though, this is a good reflection of the value of our global supply chain for all of our businesses because despite the challenges in the Red Sea and the Suez, there has been a lengthening of supply chain for many producers and suppliers. There has also been -- that's added some cost for some of the folks trying to get into Europe, in particular, from Asia. But because of our global supply chain, we are able to provide from other parts of the world. So we're not seeing the increased cost. What I'd say is most of the effect we've seen, I'd say, is temporary as people adjust to the new lengthened global supply chain. So we're not really baking in any uplift or loss at this point from the issues in the Suez. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Matthew Blair : So the automakers have been talking about running a lot leaner going forward and keeping their inventories low and supporting their margins rather than the previous way of just overproducing and then putting everything on sale. And I was wondering, how do you see the shift from Celanese's perspective? Is this potentially exciting to you because perhaps it could result in higher margins for Celanese? Or is potentially a concern because it might have some impact on our overall auto volumes? Scott Richardson : We don't see it as being really a material impact for us. I mean if you think about carrying lower inventories, it's largely already kind of been baked into where things are right now. And honestly, it just creates, I think, less kind of ups and downs from what we've historically seen because you get restocking, destocking to not have that in the future, certainly would not be a bad thing for us at all. So -- but overall, we don't see really any significant impact. Matthew Blair : Sounds good. And then I just want to clarify on the Clear Lake acetic acid expansion, this $100 million in productivity. Is this also your estimate of like the long-run EBITDA potential for this expansion? Or what do you think it could generate in a more normalized environment? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, remember, we justified the expansion of Clear Lake acid and the CCU project, really, well, the Clear Lake just on productivity, so catalyst savings, energy savings, less freight by shipping out of the U.S. versus Asia to Europe, so those sorts of things. So that $100 million, I would say, is intact. It also tied to the CCU project, which again was a very low-cost project that really was initially put in place just to generate additional methanol for use at our Clear Lake site. Now we think there'll be more value from that as we go forward as we see what customer demand is for lower carbon products, but we probably won't have a good feel for that until later in the year and into 2025. If we were to get in a situation like we saw in '21 or even in '18, where a lot of supply disruption, rapid demand growth obviously, we could use Clear Lake for a source of acetic acid production into those very tight markets, which would greatly increase the return. But again, we're not counting on that. We justified the project based on productivity. And if there is a flywheel if we get into periods of higher demand and margins. Scott Richardson : Yes, Mike, I'd add one of the other benefits in the near term for us is that adds redundancy to our U.S. Gulf Coast network. And we called out in the prepared comments that we had some unexpected outages that would have more or less been offset had we had the new acetic acid unit up and operating. So it gives us that redundancy to ensure that some of the near-term blips that we've had in our U.S. Gulf Coast network in the past, we're able to manage those better in the future. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Roberts from Mizuho. John Roberts : Back to Sal's question, Red Sea and the Suez. Do you think the reduced Asia POM exports into Europe or coincident with the Red Sea incident here? It seems odd that China would be improving before Lunar New Year. And I think Japan just slipped back into recession. So we're not hearing from other companies about demand picking up in Asia. Lori Ryerkerk : In China, in Asia, which is reducing the amount of material that is having to move out of Asia. So I think subsequently, we may see that impact continue because of the Red Sea, but I really think it does demonstrate a strengthening of the market in Asia. John Roberts : And then secondly, I'm not sure we heard earlier about the stocking cycle in Vamac rubber. Is it harder to track customer inventory in that product area? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, Vamac is a little unique in that it is a highly differentiated, high-value product, primarily used in auto, it has some unique attributes, and we have some unique marketing positions. So it's not provided by a lot of people. I would say when we -- it was one of the reasons actually that we were so interested in the M&M equity that was one of the product lines that we thought would be highly complementary to Santoprene, and we back have found for future projects is highly complementary. But I would also say, due to reliability issues, it was very -- in high demand, it was very constrained in '21 and '22. So one of the things that we focused on since the acquisition is resolving those reliability issues and increasing the production, which we were successful at doing. I would say mid-'23 when we were able to get our volumes up, we saw customers buying up everything they could because they were used to have it go toward. And so as we move to the fourth quarter, they realized supply stability was better, and we went back to what I think will be -- well, we had a low point in fourth quarter. And then I think this year, as we go forward, we'll see more normal demand patterns versus kind of the high highs we saw a second third quarter and a low that we saw in the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research. Jaideep Pandya : The first question is on M&M. If I go back to the -- did the acquisition, half of this business is sort of nylons and then half of this business is China and Asia. So when we look at the current level of earnings versus what you thought $900 million, where is the exact shortfall regionally and product-wise? Is this in Asia? Or is it actually Europe, U.S. country? Is this a nylons or is this outside nylon? That's my first question. The question really is around the acetic value chain. This year, potentially, you will still have some pressure because of demand versus supply upstream in acetic acid. What is your strategy with regards to VAE and DPP in the middle stream or downstream? Are you going to push to gain more market share? Or are you happy to sort of have a more upstream position? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So maybe talk about the M&M acquisition. I mean you're right, a significant amount is nylon, but some of it is high temperature in nylon, more specialized nylons. I think where we have seen the challenges since the acquisition in nylon is really around more standard grade and volumes that were lost in 2022 due to pricing decisions that were made at that time. I think the teams have done a really good job starting to get some of that back, which is important, and that will continue to happen again and will continue to see improvement in variable margin as we flow through what now has been reduced with lower cost raws and lower fixed costs. So I don't know that it was really -- while it was around nylon, I wouldn't say it was specific to any one region or not. I mean DuPont was very strong in Asia, outside of China, which has actually been a pretty stable market this year. They were stronger in the U.S., which for auto has been stronger. They weren't as strong in Europe. Celanese was stronger there. So I would say it's not specific to any one region, but it's been more of a challenge specific to the volume loss that happened in 2022 and the steps that we have taken to start recovering that volume in a fairly low demand environment. And your second question around acetic acid, maybe I'll ask Scott take that. Scott Richardson : Yes. Very similar to what we saw last year. The current dynamics that we're seeing in the market globally, it makes a lot more sense for us to be pushing product downstream just given where some of the pricing and margin is on the upstream, and VAE has been a heavy lift for us from an earnings standpoint along with our redispersable powders as well as the acetate tow business as we talked about. And the current dynamics, it just makes a lot of sense for us to continue to maximize production as far downstream as we can. Kevin, we'll make the next question. Operator : Certainly, our final question today is coming from Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Patrick Cunningham : Maybe just a clarification. On the $50 million turnaround impacts, are the large majority isolated in the first quarter? And do you have any other planned turnarounds to be up in 2024 or early 2025? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Patrick. So the $50 million is in the first quarter. There -- we're up about $50 million from last year. So through the remainder of the year, there's probably another $50 million spread across the remainder of three quarters. But that's consistent with last year. So incremental to '23 it\u2019s $50 million and I would think of it all occurring in the first quarter. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. Brandon Ayache : Thanks, everyone. We'd like to thank everyone for joining. As always, we're around after the call if you have any follow-up questions at all, Kevin, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Bill Cunningham : Thanks, Diego. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Kyrish, Chief Financial Officer.  Celanese distributed its first quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both the press release and prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all of these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. With that, Diego, let's please go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : I guess, Lori, just first off, just given all the various moving parts globally and so on and so forth. Maybe you can just share with us your updated view on just the macroeconomic construct globally. You [indiscernible] the U.S., Europe and China in context from the previous headwinds of destocking and just weaker growth, et cetera? Lori Ryerkerk : Ghansham, look, on the macro, what I would say is, look, it's generally unchanged from what we've been saying in the past few quarters. I would say we haven't seen any big positives or negative this quarter from what we had expected. We called out last quarter, we really thought we were at the end of destocking. I think the movements this year, what we're seeing in the order book, the stability of the order book has proven that to be true.  In China, specifically, I'd say, as we said last quarter, China for China is pretty steady. It's okay. It's the exports that are lagging to primarily Europe, but also other regions of the world, and we're not seeing some of the pull-through of material because of those -- that lag in exports. The U.S. remains pretty steady, I would say, across all the sectors. And Europe, although we did see a little improvement since the middle of last year, I would still say it remains lackluster and below normal levels in Europe.  I would also say, as we move forward, we're really not seeing some of the seasonal uplift we would have expected at the end of the first quarter and into second quarter. Overall, I'd say all the sectors are pretty steady. I think the notable sector in terms of poor demand continues to be construction, paints and coatings, et cetera. And although I do think there, we would expect as we move into the second half that we maybe start to see recovery there. I think PPG called out this quarter that they've had 11 quarters of flat to down.  And there in second quarter, expecting to see low single-digit growth and some further growth in second half. So we hope that's true. If so, we should see a little bit of recovery there as we moved into the second half. I mean I would characterize it much like we did even a year ago, which is we still think people are still spending. They're still spending on experiences, on travel, airlines are having a good time, but they're not spending on goods yet. It will normalize at some point, but we're not seeing that normalization yet. Ghansham Panjabi : That's comprehensive, Lori. And just in terms of the related question as to what would actually kickstart demand from your perspective? Would it just be as simple as interest rates being [ reduced ] on a global basis? And then related to that, you had called out new capacity over the last 6 months, specific to the comments on Chinese acetic acid, et cetera. Is that capacity more disruptive than you thought? Or is it just that demand was weaker than you thought initially? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I think in terms of kickstarting it's really just when do people get confident in the environment again, when do we see a shift back to normalized spending on durable goods. Clearly, we could use some China -- sorry, some Europe recoveries would be really helpful. But it's nothing more than that. Like I said, consumers are spending. We just need them to start spending on durable goods again. And again, I do think that will happen in time.  I think your question on China, what I would say is, I would say the new capacity has it been more disruptive than we thought, I would say, yes, because the demand for that, which was being planned to go in, has not developed. So there were some downstream consumers that were being built at the same time. They've been delayed. Obviously, they've been delayed because the demand for those products are delayed. So it is ultimately a demand answer.  The good news there is though we are seeing some acetic acid flowing into new applications, like [ caprolactam ] and others. So again, I think it's a temporary phenomenon. If you look at what's been added, even what's to come, this is not such a large number that I think we're back where we were 20 years ago. I think we -- it's just a question of demand normalizing and catching up with the supply we have now. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Michael Leithead : Great. I wanted to dovetail and ask about full year guidance. Lori, it seems like from your remarks just now the macro conditions are maybe still a bit uninspiring. So the bridge from sort of the $5 is funded out of the EPS in the first half to about 6 50 at the midpoint in the second half. Is that all controllable Celanese action? Or do you need the world to get a bit better from here to hit those numbers? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks, Mike. I would characterize it as we will hit those numbers with just controllable actions. And if you think about it, M&M synergies are heavily loaded and compounding as we go through the year. So now that we have full visibility into the data, everything due to our S/4HANA upgrade for the M&M assets. And some -- and also the results of like the Uentrop shutdown and some of the other footprint actions we took last year, we really start to see those synergies grow and compound as we move through the year.  So that's a major impact. The Clear Lake expansion, while we did have a little bit of help in the first quarter from that, that will also continue to grow as we move through the year. Debt service is another one, which is more heavily loaded into the second half of the year. And I would also say our turnaround costs in the first half is about double what it's going to be in the second half. So we get some tailwind there as well. So I would say everything we know now says we're well in that range, just based on what we know. We've not really built in any recovery other than the end of destocking, as we've said before. So I think we -- I feel very -- still feel very confident that we will be within that range for full year. Michael Leithead : Great. So that's helpful. And just as a follow-up question on Engineered Materials. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about continued pricing pressure. I was hoping you could unpack that somewhat. Just where exactly are you seeing the most pricing pressure today? And was that a nylon specific comment or more broad based across the portfolio? Scott Richardson : I would talk -- think about that, Mike, in terms of -- it's really continued from what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. Really no significant changes there. Raws have come down as well. And we've been really mismatched here in Engineered Materials for more than a year on where kind of pricing for standard grade materials was versus the cost structure. And as you saw with some of the margin expansion we alluded to in the prepared comments, we're definitely catching up there. But we're not seeing a lot of ability to move pricing here in those spaces. So the team is focused, however, really around continuing to move the pipeline and work on upgrade of mix as we work our way through this year and then into 2025 to address that. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Jeffrey Zekauskas : When you look at your Engineered Materials volumes year-on-year, they're down 12%. Maybe global auto production is down 1%. And when you look at the demand for the coatings companies, maybe it's down low single digits. Why is Engineered Materials have a larger volume decrement. Scott Richardson : Yes, Jeff, I would really point to some of the real standard spaces we participated in last year, really to start moving some of the inventory levels that we had as we finished 2022. And that's really more of the driver than anything else. We also saw a little more seasonality in the medical sector here this year versus what we saw last year. So those are the main drivers. Jeffrey Zekauskas : Okay. And then sort of the reverse is the Acetyl Chain, where volumes are up year-on-year, 11%. And I take it that what you want to do is run your Clear Lake expansion more or less full out? Is that part of the reason why volumes are up? And do you expect as a base case for your volumes to be up 10% or more this year? And maybe could you comment on filter tow in that we saw really strong numbers out of Eastman, but your Acetyl Chain doesn't seem to be growing its adjusted EBIT very much. Lori Ryerkerk : Jeff, maybe -- let me just make a few comments, and then I'll let Scott add more detail. I mean, what I would say is we don't have a strategy to run at still necessarily at higher volume. The justification for the Clear Lake expansion was really in productivity, right, energy, catalyst, shipping by shipping more out of the U.S., less out of Asia. So that's not the strategy. Now having said that, we will run all of our assets where it makes sense from a demand standpoint and from an economic standpoint. So I wouldn't say that's the biggest factor there. What I'd say on tow is we did see a significant uplift in tow this year. That uplift is continuing into this year. And if you look at our first quarter volumes, I think some people have called out more seasonality. We really saw first quarter within the typical seasonality for tow, which is minor, we're talking 1% or 2%. So I think we're seeing that -- I would suggest to you we're seeing -- enjoying the same markets for tow that our competitors are. But of course, it is now in our Acetyl Chain, and we have more decision points that we can make around it to really maximize the value of the chain. Scott Richardson : Yes. Let me just add. I think as Lori said, on tow, 2024, very similar to 2023, not a continued lift, very stable there. When you look at a year-over-year basis, Q1 to Q1, Jeff, the main driver volumetrically is really just where the industry is. If you recall where we were in the first quarter of last year, we were coming off very high energy prices in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2022. European demand was relatively soft. In addition, we were still seeing China dealing with COVID in the early part of the years, which impacted volumes. So that's really the main driver on a quarter-over-quarter basis here in the acetyl business. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : Nice start to the year. For 2Q, will EM volumes [indiscernible] I guess it still looks like it's going to be down year-over-year. But the third and fourth quarter for EM, do you need volumes to improve year-over-year to sort of hit the outlook and -- how much, if at all? Scott Richardson : I think as we work into Q2, my volumes will move up a little over where they were in Q1. On a year-over-year basis, relatively flattish. Any differences are more mix related, as I talked about earlier, with kind of where we were on moving nylon last year to really get our inventory levels down. And we will see an expectation that volumes move up, really driven by 2 things in the second half. One, just as destocking has ended and that kind of normal flow through, not a real significant restocking or anything, but just slightly higher levels of volume coming from that in the second half.  But more importantly, really a commercialization of our pipeline. And we went really to an integrated commercial model in Engineered Materials in April of last year. The average length of time projects in our pipeline takes is about 18 months. So we expect kind of the efforts the commercial team has been putting in now for the last year really to start to take hold and see the value coming towards the end of this year from that. Michael Sison : And then more of -- a little bit of a longer-term question. Sales in EM running about $6 billion, maybe a little bit better than that. But longer term, when demand does recover, China, goods, et cetera, does this a $7 billion business? And what would the operating leverage [ trying to get ] volume come back look like on that growth? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I don't know the exact number where that could end up. I mean the way I would characterize it is we expect over the next year or so that EM basically starts contributing at the same level as acetyls from a margin standpoint. And then after that, while acetyls will continue to grow at kind of GDP, GDP plus a little bit, we would expect margin growth for EM to still be in that roughly 10% range that we've had in the past. So I would think about it that way. So ultimately, there's no like in number. The number continues to grow, but that's the growth rate we expect. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Starting to read a bit that some of the trade complexities in the Red Sea area are starting to resolve themselves. And so I guess, one, would you agree with that? And two, if the case and if the shipping channels become a little less challenged, how would that impact your businesses, good, bad or indifferent? Lori Ryerkerk : Vincent, thank you. Look, I would say we've been pretty indifferent so far. What we found is shipping channels and stuff where there can be a temporary disruption pretty quickly, renormalize in a new way. So I -- we haven't really seen an impact so far. And similarly, I wouldn't expect a big impact if we see some of the issues resolved. I think the market is pretty quick to correct itself. Vincent Andrews : Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the nylon business. In the prepared remarks, there was a comment about higher variable costs for higher velocity products. That's quite a mouthful. Could you just unpack that for me? Scott Richardson : Yes, Vincent, it's really related more to the Palm business, and it's really the flow-through of methanol since we weren't producing as much of our own methanol in the first quarter. It's the flow-through of that higher cost product into Palm that gets sold here in the second quarter. That's really the main impact. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. James Cannon : This is James Cannon, on for Josh. You in your prepared remarks talked about the price-to-cost benefit in the first half. Are you expecting much flow through into the second half? Or does lower pricing kind of erode that? Scott Richardson : I wouldn't expect lower pricing to erode that, James. A lot will depend upon what happens with the raw material complex. We kind of know for the first half, what the flow-through of that is going to be. So a lot just depends upon how raws develop in the second half to see how much of that continues or not. James Cannon : Okay. So just as a follow-up to that. I think if I look back -- if I look back a quarter or two, you gave in your prepared remarks, comments on price/cost being potentially the highest part of the year-over-year bridge. Is that still possible? Or just given where we stand, is that maybe a little bit more in question? Scott Richardson : It's definitely still possible based on what we're seeing for the first half. And then again, we'll just have to see how raws develop in the middle part of the year to see what then gets expensed towards the back half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : In your prepared remarks, you talked about 2 key synergy drivers for Engineered Materials, namely the shutdown of nylon 66 in Germany and the SAP ramp. Can you address those and maybe translate it to how much earnings uplift you might be anticipating in the second quarter through the fourth quarter. It didn't sound like there was much in the first quarter from those items. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I would characterize it as for the footprint actions we've taken, and there's been a number of smaller actions that we've taken as well, not including Mechelen, which we've just announced because that will really show up in next year's number. We expect about a $50 million synergy lift on a full year basis from those. And you're right. I mean we're just now starting to see the benefit of Uentrop, which is the biggest piece of that. So there's that. And then I would say on the SAP, the direct impact. I mean, obviously, we get rid of the TSA, but we've had to add our own people. So that's a smaller number than you might think, although significant. The real benefit is that we now have one view of the data, and we have everything in one system, and it is really helping us with our planning and scheduling and forecasting of demand in Engineered Materials. And so again, we're -- all of that kind of gets rolled into our synergy number, and that number for the full year is 150 lift from last year. Kevin McCarthy : And then secondly, for Chuck, perhaps, can you talk about how your free cash flow outlook has evolved? And specifically, I'm interested in any guidance you might be able to provide on cash taxes or the expectation therefore, in 2024. It sounded like maybe there's some timing issues around taxes we should be thinking about. Chuck Kyrish : Yes. Good question, Kevin. Yes, let me walk through how we're thinking about '24 cash flow. I would say we do expect the same cadence as we saw last year where our cash flow will be second half weighted. Teams are working hard to generate a total result for the year that's roughly consistent with last year. It will be subject to a few timing elements, of course. Outside of EBITDA growth, I would point to these drivers. We are working really hard to produce a working capital benefit to free cash flow this year. And that would be driven by further inventory reductions. Right now, we've assumed $100 million working capital benefit for the year. And it will depend on a few factors. I would say working capital, though it will be back-end loaded. It should be a use in the first half, particularly as we're preparing for some of these footprint actions and then a source in the second half. Either way, I would point out, that's a significant headwind to free cash flow versus 2023 as we had a tremendous year in working capital benefit to free cash flow last year, that was really driven by about $400 million positive cash from reducing our inventory. So I just wanted to point that out. You're right, cash tax, it is an unusual year for us for cash taxes. In total, this year, there'll be about $300 million. That's higher year-over-year by $75 million. One unusual item that we have that will hit us in the second quarter, we're going to pay almost all of a roughly $90 million transfer tax that's related to the previously announced debt redomiciliation projects that are currently in execution phase and are key to our cash repatriation plans. We'll pay this onetime tax in the second quarter, but we would expect to be able to recoup that tax in future years and through the associated foreign tax credits. It is a big payment here in the first half, so I did want to call that out. I mean if you think about cash tax of the $300 million, 3/4 of that will be in the first half. I would say cash cost of synergies should be $100 million to $150 million this year. That's higher year-over-year by $25 million to $75 million, which will just kind of depend on what that final number ends up being and the timing of some of those actions. Positive offsets to free cash flow this year, year-over-year, lower cash interest by about $50 million and a benefit of $100 million to $150 million in lower CapEx versus last year. So I hope that helps in terms of some of the drivers and how we're thinking and especially the timing associated with those. Operator : And our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : Now that Clear Lake is up and running, is rationalization of your acetyls assets firmly off the table? Or is that an option to be considered because of this tough supply-demand environment? Lori Ryerkerk : Aleksey, thank you. I would say we're pretty satisfied with where we are with our footprint for acetyls. I mean, everything we have is specifically designed to serve a certain region and set of customers, and we like having the optionality and flexibility that we have. We've also continued to build out our downstream. You saw the announcement about new VAE in China, some of the RDP debottlenecks we're doing. And that really is all about how do we continue to build the foundational level of earnings in acetyls and really kind of stabilize our earnings from acetyls.  But if you look at just specifically at acetic acid, for example, Clear Lake, clearly, we believe the lowest cost, lowest carbon footprint, really important to meet our needs in the U.S. and now into Europe. China really serves China, again, because of our technology there, we believe, one of the lowest cost producers in China. And then Singapore meets the need for the rest of Asia, particularly India and some other areas, and is still very competitive with other sources of supply into that region. So again, I would say we're always looking at our footprint. What we need to add, if there's opportunities to debottleneck, but also opportunities to rationalize. But right now, I would say our footprint is pretty good for purpose. Aleksey Yefremov : And as a follow-up, you used to be fairly transparent to investors to see outgrowth in Engineered Materials versus end markets. It's been harder to judge through the last few quarters. Are there any metrics such as wins, I don't know, your size of your pipeline that you can point us to, to kind of demonstrate that you keep outperforming your end markets or that outperformance will resume perhaps in future periods? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I would say the pipeline is our winning factor, if you will, for Engineered Materials and what has allowed us to outperform in our sector. I think that continues to be true, especially now that we're 1 year since we went into a common system for both our heritage assets as well as our acquisition of M&M. And we do continue to look at it very closely. I will tell you the number of projects being generated is consistent. More importantly, the value of the projects that are being generated is very strong. But maybe I'll ask Scott if he has any more details on that he wants to add. Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean we gave a stat last quarter about the fact that we created about 20% more revenue opportunity per sales employee in the second half of last year compared to what we did in the second half of '22. And so that is, I think, a really good proof point to how things are moving. The only other thing I'd add is we've been doing a lot of really cleaning up of this new kind of integrated business over the course of the last 18 months. And that will start to stabilize as we get the footprint actions in place and really get our inventories now kind of back in line with where they need to be. So I think it will be a little more visible, Aleksey, as we get into the end of this year and into the next year as to being able to see that outperformance versus the various end markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : I guess first off, just curious about your comments around volume. It sounded like the activity in Q1 was seemingly getting slightly better in the -- in the earlier part of the quarter and then maybe it sold out in March. And then are you seeing a similar pattern here of things may be getting better in April? I mean how would you kind of characterize Q2 thus far versus your comments and then what you saw in Q1? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, I would say from a volume standpoint, both for acetic acid and EM, it was very much as expected in Q1 throughout the quarter. Scott Richardson : And then as we look to Q2, the order book is in line with the guide we put together right now, Arun. I mean we're through the month of April, and we have good visibility here to May. So I think we feel comfortable with the comments we put in our prepared comments. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. And then just a question about the second half and as you look into '25. So it looks like you'll be ending the year on a, say, $6.60 rate for EPS for the second half. If you were to annualize that maybe you're $13.25 or so. If you add some volume and maybe some deleveraging on top of that, it seems like you could get close to $14. So is that kind of how you're thinking about '25? I know it's a ways off, but just maybe got some -- wanted to get your initial thoughts. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, we've had so much variability in the last few years. I hesitate to go much further out than a quarter these days. But look, I think if you look at the run rate in the second half because it's built on controllable actions, not built on market that not an unreasonable place to start as you start thinking about '25. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Lori, there was a competitor outage in acetyl starting, I think, late, late February. I believe it's still on allocation of VAM and acid. Did you benefit? And are you still benefiting from that competitor situation? Lori Ryerkerk : I would say while there was some temporary run-up in pricing, it was pretty small and fairly short lived. So I would not say we're seeing any benefit from it continuing, and the benefit was pretty small during the quarter. And I think that just is reflective of really the lower demand that we've been seeing globally that an outage of that magnitude really didn't move the market very much. And again, I think it's not as much question on supply, but just demand is really still not back at normalized levels, particularly even in the Western Hemisphere. David Begleiter : Understood. And just on M&M synergies, what were they in Q1? What will they be in Q2? And what should be the cadence in the back half of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : I don't have an exact number here in front of me. I mean I would tell you, Q1 is definitely the lightest and they continue to build and compound as we move through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. John McNulty : So I guess the first one is on raw materials. So I believe for EM, you were expecting as much as $150 million benefit as kind of lower costs rolled through the system. It looks like you got -- you're going to have 20 in the second quarter, and it's comparable to what you saw maybe in the first. So is that still or reasonable outlook just based on where raws are right now that you could see $100 million, $110 million of benefit in the back half of the year? Or have things gotten better or worse? I guess, can you help us to think about that? Scott Richardson : Yes, John, as I said earlier, definitely in line to be in that range based upon what we're seeing for the first half. And again, a lot just depends upon what -- how things move in the middle part of the year to see how our cost structure will develop as we get into the second half. John McNulty : Okay. And then I guess the second question would just be in the Acetyl Chain business. Obviously, there's some new capacity in the markets beyond just yours that are impacting the business. It looks like there's more capacity coming on next year potentially as well. So I guess, if we don't see much of an improvement in the overall demand environment, are there other levers that you can pull in your Acetyl Chain business to drive incremental profitability? Or are we at a point now where it's really going to be about the market improving and developing from a demand perspective? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So let me make a few comments on that, John. If we look at this year, there were two large, I'd say, world-scale capacities added in acetic acid in China. And again, the impact of those has been a bit more than we thought because some of the companion downstream consumers that were supposed to come on at the same time have been delayed due to the overall demand in the market. Next year, there's really only one small unit coming on that we're aware of in acetic acid, some other capacity a little bit in [ VAM ]. It's not enough that it should have a major impact.  But we're still not at the [ whim ] of the market. I mean we still find opportunities to use both our global and our chain flexibility to really maximize our earnings in this market and try to maintain that level of foundational earnings. I'd say the other good opportunity, which is developing for us is our ability now to provide sustainable products into the market based upon the CCU project that we've put in at Clear Lake. Now that we have our ISCC certification for methanol as low carbon material, we're able to offer that to all of our customers in kind of whatever acetic acid products they desire, and we are seeing a lot of interest in that.  We also have a sustainability advantage for VAE, which customers are interested in for kind of its low odor, low VOC emissions. So I think there are some opportunities we have that are unique to us that others do not currently have at this period in time. And we see that demand starting to grow and hope that will become a more significant part of our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. John Ezekiel Roberts : It sounded like the sequential change in EM earnings was nylon up sequentially and other plastic earnings down sequentially. Was the decline in the -- sequential decline in the other plastics due to the downturn or price pressure or what drove that? Scott Richardson : I would focus on the turnaround costs, John. I mean that was really the largest driver is really offsetting the nylon. John Ezekiel Roberts : And then I wasn't thinking that medical was that seasonal? What's driving the seasonality in medical? Scott Richardson : It's -- honestly, John, it's kind of what we always see. In some years, it's more acute than others, and we saw it come down a little more than what we saw last year from Q4 into Q1. And it's really just the timing of how our customers build inventory for the new year. And it -- Q4 ends up usually being one of our strongest quarters and Q1 tends to be weaker, which kind of goes counter to how everything else moves, but that's kind of been the historical seasonality really in most of our medical business. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Daniel Rizzo : This is Dan Rizzo, on for Laurence. We talked a lot about the Clear Lake expansion. I was wondering if an expansion in Singapore or some place like that would be necessary given the growth that's potentially there in India over the next, I don't know, few years to a decade. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. We don't see that on horizon. It probably wouldn't -- if there were more of an increase in demand, it probably wouldn't necessarily make sense to expand the Singapore plant. But for what we have right now and for that developing market in India, Singapore is [ sufficient ]. And we have options to bring material into Singapore from other parts of the world, should we see that demand increase. Scott Richardson : Dan, the only thing I'd add is on a downstream basis, the VAE expansion that we've just done is as much for growth in Southeast Asia and India as it is for China, honestly. We have a -- we already have VAE plant in Singapore. That plant was actually supplying some demand in China. We're now able to kind of shift that network really to service growing customers in our VAE demand, such as paints and coatings, mortars and adhesives. Daniel Rizzo : That's really helpful. And then with costs, we talked again a lot about price cost with raw materials. But I was just wondering what's happening with labor and potentially transportation costs if they're kind of elevated and going higher and that, that could have a kind of a negative impact towards the second half of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think we've seen over the last several years, pressures on labor cost, as has everybody, but I would say through productivity steps and others, that's managed, that's baked in. And I'm not seeing any significant pressure there for the second half of the year. Scott Richardson : Yes. And on transportation, I mean, this is a common theme we've seen now for a while. And I think that has impacted product movements around the globe for the industry broadly. So really nothing is different now or in the second half than what we've been seeing here for a while. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Eric Zhang : This is Eric Zhang, on for Patrick. On the incremental excess supply in China acetic acid, do you have an outlook on when the delayed downstream startups will be resolved? And once that is resolved, do you expect it to have a meaningful uplift in acetic acid pricing in China? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, the projects that we were aware of, I think are a quarter or two delayed. I mean, the real question, of course, is that demand for those products has to be driven by more demand for exports quite frankly. And so how long that takes to resolve is really tied to consumer spending, general view of the economy, people's confidence in buying goods again. So I would say, while we do expect that capacity to be -- to start up, whether over in full or whether it will just replace other capacity remains to be seen.  The other thing that I said earlier, which I emphasize again, is there are some new uses in China of acetic acid that should start taking some of this capacity, like [ caprolactam ]. So I can't give you a number now, but I would say, I think we're still several quarters away from starting to see any significant movement in that. Operator : Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : Yes. So firstly, I want to ask a little bit on Engineered Materials and specifically your auto exposure. As we're seeing more and more automakers delay their EV plants and sticking with ICE engines, even just a few months ago, how does this change against your plan and your potential margin uplift? And also, are you seeing any impact for consumers trading down to lower-priced models as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me try to answer the first part, and then I'll let Scott take the second part. I would say, look, as long as consumers are buying vehicles, we're happy. EVs do have about a 10% higher content available to us than ICEs, but we still have a very large position in ICE vehicles. As to the extent people are converting to hybrids, hybrids are about 20% more content available to us than ICE. So while there are some shifts and shifts in which products, as long as people are buying vehicles, like I said, we're happy. Scott Richardson : Yes. And we have to continue to work our pipeline really to touch on all 3 areas, whether it's battery electric, hybrid or ICE, just because each market is developing a little differently. I mean, in China now, over 20% of the market is EV. And so we still have to continue to focus EV there pretty heavily. So it is important that we kind of build that broadly speaking. We have not seen a significant change in terms of the types of vehicles and what our customers are buying and really an impact to our business at all.  And in fact, I mean, if you look at things on a year-over-year basis, which is probably the right way to look at it, auto builds were up, I think, around 2% or so. Globally, our business, our volumes were up about 4% on a year-over-year basis into auto. So I think from that perspective, specifically, we feel like the project pipeline model continues to deliver value for us. Salvator Tiano : Great. And I also want to ask to go back a little bit on the China acetyls capacity expansion. I assume some of these downstream projects that were supposed to absorb the acid demand are on the polyester chain, but at least on our estimates, there are a bunch of VAM and EVA projects as well. So certainly, as they come online, they will absorb more of the acetic acid, but you do participate in these markets, and you did have a comment in the prepared remarks that you have much higher variable margins, I believe, in the downstream projects. So as this capacity comes online?  On a net basis, would that actually be good for you? Or could it be a source of margin pressure because you may lose some margin of the -- on your downstream business? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I would simplify it and just say, any additional demand for acetic acid, no matter which end market is in to, is good for us. So again, because we do sell a lot of acids to others as well. Scott Richardson : Yes. And I would just add, I think when new capacity starts up, whether it's acetic acid, VAM, et cetera, it's going to come in and it's going to have a near-term impact. But those things then even out over the subsequent quarters. And our business is really about flexing our global network and that full value chain. And so one quarter, we're going to make money one way. The next quarter, we're going to make money a different way. And that really is the uniqueness of this kind of integrated value creation model that we have within the Acetyl Chain. Bill Cunningham : Diego, we will make the next question our last one, please. Operator : And that final question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : I again, wanted to revisit the Acetyl Chain, particularly in China. I mean, reading through your prepared remarks, it just seemed like the first quarter was like a tale of 2 cities. It seemed you guys started very strong. And then by February pricing started weakening. Just trying to understand the dynamic behind that. I mean it seems the 2 new facilities that you guys talked about, they've been around for, call it, 5 or 6 months. So what really caused that change between the first half of Q1 and the second half? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, Hassan, you may recall, I mean, typically in China, Q1 is seasonally lower demand quarter because of Chinese New Year. So if you look at total -- if you look at acetic acid prices, specifically in China, I mean, what we did see in Q1 was the lowest price since fourth quarter of '20. And again, not unexpected, very much in line with what we've expected. And again, it is based on the lower demand. I would also tell you, even though that new capacity maybe came on 2 quarters ago, it takes a while for them to ramp up and to really get into the market. So I would say it's shaping up very much as expected. I would also say this is normal as Scott said, that there is some minor disruption in the market when these come online, but things do settle down over time. Scott Richardson : Yes. And let me just add, Hassan, I think it's important to remember, we have the single largest -- our single unit -- the largest single unit turnaround in the history of the corporation in the first quarter, largely hitting the Acetyl Chain business. We had some of these dynamics in China, yet the business still generated a 28% EBITDA margin. So it's a very resilient business that finds a way to still deliver value even when we see market disruptions or when we see higher costs from things like turnarounds. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. And as a follow-up, if I could just sort of hit on the 2024 guidance again, maybe in EBITDA terms. I mean over the last couple of months, you talked about some of the drivers, and I just want to make sure, numerically, I'm thinking about them or they're trending as you guys had stated a couple of months ago. I mean you talked about the M&M synergies being, call it, $150 million EBITDA-wise worth of a tailwind, Clear Lake expansion being around $100 million. And then obviously, you had some offsets in terms of headwinds from some of the outages that you had last year. So I mean, as you sort of sit there and think about some of those headwinds and tailwinds, incrementally year-on-year, how much of a boost will we get from some of these controllables and new capacity additions? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Again, I think if you look at versus 2023, those things that you called out, M&M synergies that $150 million, Clear Lake expansion, we've asked them to still deliver $100 million for the year. And we probably have another -- an offset of about $100 million, maybe a bit more for higher turnaround-related expenses as well as some of the nonrepeatable impacts from last year. I think the 2 factors you are not factoring in there is we will have lower debt services year as we've paid down over $1.5 million of our net debt. And that's probably another 50 or so, and then we'll have lower costs flowing through from our inventories with all of the inventory we took out last year and be able to flush out some of that higher cost inventory and as we said, that may be the single biggest factor this coming year as well. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor over to Bill Cunningham for closing comments. Bill Cunningham : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call for any follow-up questions. Diego, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Thank you. With that, we conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Bill Cunningham : Thanks, Diego. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Kyrish, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its second quarter earnings released via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations website yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our website. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both the press release and prepared comments. Form 8-K report containing all of these materials has also been submitted to the SEC. With that, Diego, let's please go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please state your questions. Josh Spector : Yes. Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask on some of the moving pieces within Engineered Materials. I mean, obviously nice to see a good step up here in the second quarter, but I think there's been a constant debate around where the market is, and what's stable and in your control versus what needs to have a market improvement. So I guess when you look at your expectations about the improvement into 2Q, or sorry into 3Q, and maybe a stable second half, what are you assuming behind the market to get there versus cost savings in your control? And given all the cuts we've made in expectation, is this kind of the point where you feel like you're now conservative enough, or are there other things that you would have us watch out for? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Good morning, Josh. Thanks for the question. If we look at our Q3 guidance, I would say, we're generally expecting things to be unchanged in terms of overall market conditions. We do expect a little bit of growth in auto builds in the second half, particularly in China, which I think is consistent with what others in the industry are seeing, but generally everything else is pretty stable. We're not expecting a lot of downturns. That said, we do continue to expect some moderate growth in our volumes based on the strength of our product pipeline. We also expect some continued growth in margin based on synergy pull-through and also pull-through of lower cost raw materials in inventory. So I would say, we don't need market improvement. I guess maybe other than that, a little bit in auto, in order to achieve our second half outlook from an Engineered Materials standpoint. Josh Spector : And I guess just within the auto side specifically, considering that's been an area of kind of weakening demand. Is it specific new platforms on certain cars that has driven it. Is it regional with Asia? I guess, what gives you the confidence there specifically? Lori Ryerkerk : I think a lot of it is the work around the integration. We now have access to customers with Celanese materials that we previously didn't have, because of the contacts that our heritage DuPont had. It's particularly in non-China, parts of Asia. And similarly we have some outlets for some of the heritage M&M materials that we didn't have before. And I think it's really, again, the project pipeline. I mean, we've been working now for, well, for a long time, but with the entire portfolio for 18 months to really identify those new customers, those new orders, those new areas within existing customers and make sure that we're strong across all the platforms and auto, ICE, Engineered Materials and hybrids. And we called out last quarter earnings, in fact, some of the applications we're getting on EVs with nylon, which is an area where DuPont didn't necessarily play. Josh Spector : Understood. Thanks, Lori. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please state your questions. Mike Sison : Hi, good morning. In terms of the fourth quarter versus the third, it does look like you'll need some improvements sequentially, is, at the midpoint, is a lot of that within your control. Some of the factors that you've talked about in the past? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. If you do the math, you would expect that we need some additional lift in the fourth quarter. I would put it down to a few things. We, it should be our largest quarter of synergy capture, for the Engineered Materials. We should start seeing more of a full year run rate on Clear Lake, as we'll have gotten through all the effects of the supplier outages and a little bit from Hurricane Beryl in the third quarter. So that will be an uplift there. I would also say, our mix has changed. So with the acquisition of M&M, we now have a higher presence in China. And so we wouldn't expect as much seasonality, now in the fourth quarter, as we've typically seen with the heritage Celanese portfolio. So all of those things come together. Again, we're not, other than this a little bit of uptick that's being predicted in auto. We are not really expecting material conditions to change. So, it really will be the results of kind of the self-help, the activities that we've undertaken over the last 18 months. Scott Richardson : Yes. The one thing I'd add to that, Mike is, is the work we're doing in the commercial organization, in the Engineered Materials business. We integrated the commercial teams in the early part of Q2 last year, and the average length of time that projects sit in our pipeline is about 18 months to 24 months. So we're really coming up on that kind of first 18 months plateau here at the end of this year in the fourth quarter and going into next year. And given kind of the trajectory we've seen on the success of the volume lift from Q1 to Q2, we're really starting to see the benefit of that model play out with bringing M&M into that EM business. And so you do have a little bit of an element of that as well from how we see the pipeline developing at the end of the year. Mike Sison : Right. And the quick follow up. The macro hasn't been very helpful for you and can be in general. So, if things get worse sequentially into the second half, what changes can you make to sort of hit this range? And then how do you sort of help us think about '25, and the ramp up potential of earnings - the earnings process for Celanese longer term. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, things can always get worse, right? And we've seen that, but I would also say, things, things have been certainly very challenging this year, and the results that we're delivering this year are really based on the remarkable efforts of our teams and their ability to innovate, the resilience that they've shown, and really looking under every rock for sources of value. So, if it gets worse, that will continue. I would say, Europe for all practical measures has been in a near recessionary kind of condition. So, we think it's going to be stable based on what we can see in our order books right now, certainly for Q3. As we go into 2025, we will continue to have self-help, which will help lift us in '25. I think if you look at '25, we can think about the run rate that we'll see in the second half of the year continuing through '25. Then we'll have another tranche of M&M synergies on top of that, as well as full productivity from Clear Lake next year and probably some additional interest rate benefits as well. So I think, the things that we've seen this year will continue to compound into next year and raise the 2025 results. But frankly, it's just too early to tell what the fundamental economic conditions are going to be in 2025, yet. Mike Sison : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please state your questions. Mike Leithead : Great. Thanks. Good morning, team. A few questions on the acetyls force majeure. I guess, first, are we still in force majeure? And when do you expect to fully resolve these disruptions? Two, should we think about any insurance proceeds or any sort of restitution for you guys from these disruptions. And then finally, apologies if I missed this, but what is the all-in expected cost impact from this outage? Lori Ryerkerk : Thanks for the question, Mike. We are still in force majeure. The units obviously are restarted, running well, but it is a longish supply chain in the western hemisphere. So we're in force majeure till we can reestablish those supply chains into Europe, which is the work going on currently. But we fully expect that we'll lift the force majeure sometime in this quarter. In terms of restitution. We're really just focused right now and have been focused in the second quarter on working with our suppliers to understand what the issues were, how we could get through them more quickly, how to address reliability issues going forward, how to make sure that we maintain really good relationships? That's really been our focus now. And we'll have discussions about any, any form of restitution later. Mike Leithead : Okay. I'm sorry. And then just in terms of all-in cost impact? Lori Ryerkerk : Oh, I'm sorry. I just missed it. Yes. So, this quarter, second quarter, I would say, it was about $35 million. And then next quarter we'll see another $5 million to $10 million. Mike Leithead : Okay, great. And then I just want to follow up on some of the competitive dynamics in your product. I think in the remarks, as commodity, commodity nylon is below the cost curve. There's been some opportunistic pricing, if you will, in some other areas. I guess, what is your best kind of judgment about where we stand today? Or are we still atrophying in price in some of these areas? Are we stabilizing, or have we started to recover here? Lori Ryerkerk : As you called out, Mike, I mean, we definitely saw price pressure on raw nylon, polymer, this last quarter. It has definitely gone down, and it's, it's affected some of the margin uplift we expected from pull-through. That said, I think this really points out the benefit of the strategy, we took though to shutdown standard grade polymerization at Uentrop. And really be able to give ourselves flexibility in terms of where we choose to source raw nylon, polymer and compounded for our customers. So that's really paid off. We would have seen more of a hit this past quarter, if we, if we hadn't done that. I would say, on the other products, not as much pricing pressure as margin pressure as we've seen some increase in raw materials, especially think about palm, where we've seen some, some increase in ethylene. So those being the two biggest, I would say, again nylon, its priced, but mitigated by the steps that we've taken; palm, we've seen pressure on ethylene pricing. Mike Leithead : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Jeff Zekauskas : Thanks very much. Were the outages at Clear Lake caused by anything else other than carbon monoxide difficulties? Was there some other source of inefficiency in the quarter? Scott Richardson : Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, with the suppliers that we have, and we've talked about multiple suppliers, was really around several different raw materials that we source. Jeff Zekauskas : Several. So, so it's a wider issue than CO. Scott Richardson : Yes. We're not talking about the specific materials, Jeff. I mean, at the end of the day, we talked about acetic acid, and we buy several different raw materials for that. Jeff Zekauskas : And then secondly, can you talk about your preference as to whether you would sell acetic acid, or you would sell them in the current environment. How is that, can you compare the profitability of those two chemical outputs? Scott Richardson : Yes. Honestly, Jeff, it really does fluctuate week-to-week region-to-region. And we are looking at kind of where the different markets are at, and kind of where they're trending based upon kind of where the fundamental supply/demand dynamics are. And that is, is going to be kind of one way in one geography for the first part of the quarter and maybe a little different. I would say, in general, we tend to be pivoting more as we talked about last quarter, in Asia more further downstream. We've seen more opportunities in our emulsions as well as our redispersible powders business to be able to grow in some of those areas. We talked in the prepared comments about some of the, out of a kind substitution that we've been successful driving there with the expanded capacities that we have. In addition, with those expanded capacities, we've been able to really work with our customers in India, specifically to kind of help develop that market and really start to drive there. So that has been a nice growth area for us more on the Asia side. And I would say, it's a little more balanced than where we're selling in the Western hemisphere. Jeff Zekauskas : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please state your question. Ghansham Panjabi : Hi, guys. Good morning. Lori, I just want to go back to my usual question on the sort of the macro pulse. Obviously, your volumes have been weak for several quarters. But just based on your sense as we spent around the world, do you feel like the macro is relatively stable on a consolidated basis? Or is it just your own initiatives that are masking what is otherwise a sequential deceleration? And I'm just asking because, obviously, the data in China is very poor. Commodity prices have pulled back, including oil, et cetera, more recently. So on a real-time basis, what are you seeing? Lori Ryerkerk : On a real-time basis, Ghansham, I would say, stable is the right word. Again, I go back to auto. Auto actually has been a little stronger in the U.S. and Asia. Europe has weakened year-on-year. But globally, auto has been pretty stable. And we do see, especially in China, some further strengthening in the second half. Consumer and electronics, again, pretty stable globally. But in our own, own portfolio because of what we've been able to do through the project pipeline, and the good work by our teams on the ground, we are starting to see some growth in consumer and electronics. We've had strong Q-on-Q growth in medical implants, which is a little bit unique to us and as expected. And we really are not destocking the cadence and consistency of orders. It continues to improve. We've got a few percent growth from that. And really, I would say, overall, I call the market stable, but we're starting to see a little bit of volume growth in Engineered Materials, anyway just because of the project pipeline and the revenue synergies, et cetera. I think in acetyls, again, stable is the right word. It is just, it is stable for construction, paints and coatings, specifically that sector at a, at a very low rate. And we thought we'd start to see some seasonal uptick there. We have not seen that in the second quarter, and we're not anticipating it now for the third quarter as well. And I think that, that's true for, for all regions. But to put it in perspective, for the company as a whole, I'd say, remind you that 25% of what we make is auto. And auto has been stable to slightly up this year. Everything else is less than that. So, we're really seeing the value, I think in our portfolio, the diversity of our portfolio and the ability that has to help us stabilize earnings and buying pockets of improvement. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Fantastic. And then for my second question, in terms of free cash flow, I mean, you guys have been very efficient in pulling levers to kind of protect free cash flow throughout this, the challenging volume environment. Is there anything for 2025 that we need to keep in mind, as it relates to the bridge, '24 versus '25 that, that you're benefiting from this year that may not repeat next year. Lori Ryerkerk : Chuck, so you would take that. Chuck Kyrish : Yes, Ghansham. I would say, actually there are a couple of things in our components of our free cash flow in '25, which will get better. It's a very heavy year for cash taxes. I've tried to talk about a lot and explain. Cash tax will be significantly lower next year. Our cash interest will continue to drive lower next year as we, as we pay off our debt. I don't see our CapEx changing materially while we're hearing our deleveraging phase, right? So we've done a lot of work on, on our inventories as well. So, there's actually a few things, next year, that we built in cash positives versus 2024. Ghansham Panjabi : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. Arun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So just going back to the force majeure comment. So, it sounds like 30, maybe [$40 million to $45 million] for the full year, which is maybe around $0.35 or so on the EPS line. So, if you think about the reduction, the remaining reduction maybe $0.65 at the midpoint. How do you think about that between price and volume? And any, any other factors, I guess driving that reduction? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I would think about it, really in, in four buckets. So the first bucket is, what you called out the $45 million or so associated with our supplier issues this year. There's probably another $40 million on top of that of Clear Lake productivity because of the timing of when all this happened relative to our startup, et cetera, that, that $100 million of productivity. We won't get there's about $40 million more of that. So that's about half of that, of that step-up that we would expect, have expected to get to foundational earnings, for, in that dollar. And then the other part of that, sorry, I'm thinking about '25, let me back up. So for your question, which is really about the dollar we went down. Again, it's the same, but so we have about, nearly half of it is coming from that. Then we have, I'd say, the issues we're having around construction, paints and coatings. And it's really more there a question of, of margins in the acetyl business. And then on the EM side, which is the third bucket, it is really the question of what are we able to pull through on raw materials, because as we've talked about with palm, margins being compressed and nylon margins being compressed, but one, because of raw materials; one, because of pricing. We had said we may get as much as 150 pull-through in, of lower raw materials. We're probably only going to get about half of that this year. So I would think about it that way. Arun Viswanathan : Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess you're answering my other question, there a little bit as well. So, just as you think about '25, then which of those factors kind of come back to you? It sounds like maybe half of that. And then on top of that, how much do you expect from synergies and deleveraging as you look into '25? Thanks. Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So when you think about '25, as I said, the run rate we see in the second half, I think is a good indicator as a base for '25. And then you think about, we also, of course, in the second half, we will get the majority of that Clear Lake supplier issues will have been cleared off. We'll start getting some more productivity. So, if you look forward, I would think about synergies. We will definitely have a good tranche of synergies next year, similar to what we've had this year and last year. And then we should have a little bit of additional help from turnarounds as well. And then, of course, we have some additional help from interest rates. Arun Viswanathan : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. Vincent Andrews : Thank you. Lori, can I ask you on the Acetyl Chain. You noted that the Clear Lake outage, I think you said was the biggest one you've had in 15 years. And obviously, it didn't lead to, to the market improving. So as you bring Clear Lake back up, are you making any adjustments to production anywhere else? Or do you think that the, the market is going to be able to absorb the resumption of production even as we kind of come out of what, what usually is a seasonally stronger period of the year? Lori Ryerkerk : Vincent, it's, it's hard to say. I mean, we make adjustments all the time to our production. And so we'll continue to look at that. I mean, it's a call that happens daily just about in the acetyl team is what we should be making where based on, on where the markets are going. So, I don't see this necessarily changing it. You're right. We didn't see much price response with the shutdown are with the loss of production during that time. But I think that just reflects how really weak the demand environment is for constructions and coatings. Scott, do you have something? Scott Richardson : Yes. I mean, how I would add to that, Vincent, is it's kind of going back to what we talked about earlier is, we're constantly looking at, at matching rates with where that demand is, and where we can maximize that really on a weekly and monthly basis. And assuming that we are able to, to get back the key raw materials where we had multiple suppliers that had issues on that, then it's going to give us the ability to have that optionality to kind of operate the chain as we normally do. And so we're rebuilding our inventories now and getting that flexibility back and to be able to get that flex, which is just going to kind of depend kind of where things are from month to month. Vincent Andrews : And then if I could just follow up. Also in the prepared remarks, you made some comments, Lori, about the new assets in China that, that have started up and that obviously, that's incremental supply that, that hasn't been absorbed. But what I was trying to square was you said that, that supply seems to have stayed largely in Asia and that European exports or exports in Europe are down are down 40% over the last 12 months. So, I just wanted to understand, is that saying that, that excess product that's come out of those Chinese facilities is just sort of weighing on only on the Asian market, but they've also actually taken product out of Europe? Or I just didn't understand why the European exports had come down? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. I think if you just look at the low margins that are associated right now, I mean, China has been basically at the cost curve. So all these new units have started up and they may be slightly advantaged that, that given the low demand in China, especially in some of the areas like construction, but also EBA, where we've seen quite a downturn here recently. That material, quite frankly it's more affordable for them to ship it, and put it in other parts of Asia, than necessarily to get it to China. So, I think it's the economics of taking that demand into Asia, which has left the channel to Europe more to the U.S. Vincent Andrews : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks very much for the clarity. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Vertical Research Partners. Please state your question. Matthew Hettwer : Hi. This is Matt Hettwer on for Kevin McCarthy. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned the potential for targeted divestiture opportunities on the same scale, as food ingredients. Would you consider looking at your other JVs there, maybe something along the lines of the Fairway Methanol JV? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, Matt, I would just say, we really never comment on what specific assets or processes that we're in. We are actively working multiple opportunities now, on various assets. We've always been very clear that if our assets are worth more to someone else, than they are to us, we are open to look at divestment. And of course, the timing of that is unpredictable. So I can't comment on any specifics. Scott Richardson : Yes. The only thing I'd add is, we have stated that we do like having an integration in methanol somewhere between about 40% and 50% of our total needs. And we think that gives us, kind of a nice balance from being in the market, much like we, articulated we're now doing with nylon. We like being able to buy and make a little bit and be in the market, for a portion of that. For methanol, we consistently - relook at what that right balance is. And we've, we've landed right in that kind of 40% to 50%. Matthew Hettwer : Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick one, you paid down 500, excuse me, $500 million in debt in the second quarter. Now looking at another $500 million in the third, how do you expect that to trend in the fourth quarter? Chuck Kyrish : Are you talking interest expense? Matthew Hettwer : Yes. Chuck Kyrish : Yes. I would, there's some moving parts in there. There's some short-term revolver draw and there is - the debt paydown. When you look at it, some of those bonds that we're paying down have really low coupons. One of the maturities was swapped down to 1%. At the same time, you've got cash that you're using to pay that down. That's actually making really good rates. So, I do expect a decline in interest, a slight decline in the second half of the year. I'd say in both Q3 and Q4, the interest expense on a net basis should be a few million lower, than you see in Q2. Matthew Hettwer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks. Good morning. In your prepared remarks, you talked about expansion between pricing raw materials and EM in the third quarter. Do you need to raise prices to achieve that, or raises due to cheaper layers of raw materials inventory? Chuck Kyrish : Aleksey our focus is really on, kind of controlling the things that we can control as Lori mentioned earlier, and launching new projects from our pipeline model. As Lori mentioned, we are assuming very similar landscape in Q3 overall to what we saw in Q2. So, we're not necessarily baking that in to our base. It really is about the raw materials flowing through. And also as we launch new projects and new opportunities, getting a mix uplift from that. So I see that being the larger portion of margin expansion. Aleksey Yefremov : Very helpful. Thank you. And on Clear Lake expansion, can you just clarify how much do you expect it to contribute this year to your EBIT, given all the challenges in total versus your $100 million target? And then how much can we expect next year, assuming the margin picture does not change? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. Look, Aleksey, I would expect about half roughly this year and then, the other half next year in addition. Aleksey Yefremov : Thanks a lot, Lori. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please state your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is [Yuzan] for Frank. First question around the lowered CapEx, that $400 million to $450 million range, how much of that is maintenance CapEx? And I just want to confirm I heard correctly that the early look on 2025 is calling for a similar range? Chuck Kyrish : Yes. What we said in the past is our maintenance right now, most years is going to run between $300 million and $350 million. And then the balance of capital we would spend each year is going to be for productivity and growth. So really kind of the earnings growth piece of it. I would just kind of remind you that as we've said historically. We have been able to generate a high-teens low 20% return our entire bucket of capital. So that tends to be we do focus on returns overall on all of our capital, but maintenance is in that $300 million and $350 million range. Unidentified Analyst : Got it and I know that the synergies for the first half came in around $40 million. Just curious what gives you guys the confidence that it will more than double in the second half of the year to reach that $150 million level? Chuck Kyrish : Yes it's really the run rate that we're on and the actions that we've taken. I mean most of the synergies this year are on the cost side of the equation. There are some revenue synergies as I alluded to earlier, but it's mainly cost and the actions that we've taken. We made several announcements around our manufacturing footprint. Those are rolling in. The Uentrop facility has been shutdown, and we're kind of ramping up servicing customers from other locations now. We'll have the next site, which will come out of the network here in the fourth quarter. And so, with some of those announcements as well as some of the actions we've taken on the functional side of things, such as implementation of our IT systems on an integrated basis. The benefits of that really were always more second half weighted than first half weighted. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question. David Huang : It's David Huang here for Dave. I guess you noted lower level participation in spot activity in both acetyls and tow. What percentage did you sell to the spot market before the outage, and I guess how should we think about the ramp of those activities in second half? Scott Richardson : Overall, each product line has a different kind of percentage that's weighted towards spot versus contract, and each region is a little bit different. I would say on the acetate tow side of things, things are a little lower percentage that is spot versus contract. Most of that business is contract. In our other product lines in acetic acid VAM emulsions for example it's different by region. And so, I think just with the constraints that we had, due to some of the supplier outages. We just - we didn't have the same flexibility that we typically do, to be able to flex our value chain in the Western Hemisphere, which limited some of those opportunities. David Huang : Okay. Got it. And then medical can you explain the other timing impacting the quarter. And I think some of your peers are still talking about continued destocking medical. I guess how has applications outside of implants performed in the quarter? Scott Richardson : It's been very stable. Our medical business it has been a key growth area for us. It has been an area focused really around growing in the areas where we can be successful, and picking some of the winning spaces. We've talked a lot about implants. We've also talked a lot about drug delivery, continuous glucose monitoring. A lot of different mega trends there that have been useful for our polymers. And we've been working these opportunities for a long period of time. Our medical implant business in general certainly is getting better each year, but you are going to have some fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. So I said that's really not demand related it's just kind of more normal order patterns, and our business outside of implants has been extremely stable and growing. David Huang : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please state your question. Hassan Ahmed : Morning Lori. Lori, a couple of quarters ago in your prepared remarks you guys talked about sort of maximizing the make versus buy flexibility at Celanese. Particularly now in light of the force majeure on the acetate/VAM side of things, is there a sort of heightened level of urgency around that? I mean how are, you how are you thinking about that and what form will that take on a go-forward basis? Lori Ryerkerk : I don't think what we've experienced Hassan would change our view. I mean we always want to have the flexibility. If you look at this past quarter, we were unable to make, because of our supplier issues in some instances. And so, we actually went into the market to buy, to the extent we could, but at a higher cost. I mean, that's not ideal, but, our first priority is to keep our customers whole and to meet our contractual commitments with our customers. So in reliability situations or turnarounds, or whatever, having that ability is good. And then, the other side of that is like we've seen in nylon, when the margins for raw polymer got so low, it is really helpful that we had taken the steps to shutdown Uentrop, and put ourselves where we could be buying raw polymer on the market, in what was a very, low-priced situation, certainly lower than we would have been able to make it ourselves. So, again, I don't think our view is changing at all in terms of wanting to always have that ability, to make or buy depending on the economic situation. And also to help us through periods of operational shortages. Hassan Ahmed : Understood. Understood. Extremely helpful. And just as a follow-up, I know you've made a couple of comments about the undifferentiated sort of nylon side of the market. Can you sort of dig a little deeper for us on, what the goings-on are with regards to supply-demand fundamentals over there? I mean, you obviously flagged the whole notion of, Chinese capacity being below the cost curve right now. So, how do you see, this year and over the next couple of years supply-demand dynamics planning out? Scott Richardson : I mean, look, nylon is no different than the rest of our portfolio in engineering materials. You kind of have three categories of business there. You have a standard-grade category. You have a kind of a spec-in category where you have more competition. Then you have the really specialty new applications area. And it's really important that we play in all three buckets there just because, customers oftentimes are buying all three. And we want to make sure we're also filling out our assets. And so, it is while the competitiveness in the standard grades is definitely there, there's still really good opportunities kind of in that spec-in and specialty area. I mean, just a simple data point, in the first half of the year, we actually closed over 400 projects in our nylon business using the pipeline model. That's a significant step up from the second half of last year. And so, it's a good proof point that what we're doing there and really the commercial team's focus on working with customers and building really nice differentiated business for the long-term is going to pay off. We're going to have to participate in the basic blocking and tackling part of the marketplace. But having that flexibility Lori just talked about, is so critical in us kind of building this more contemporary nylon model that can be overall successful, and can continue to grow. Hassan Ahmed : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Please state your question. Salvator Tiano : Yes, thank you very much. So, firstly, I want to understand, I think you - so on the $25 million package that, you mentioned the timing as well as some inventory changes that will weigh on Q3 in engineering materials. Does this mean that you were essentially producing above sales in the first half, and therefore what this $25 million is - while this is a headwind to Q3, it was actually a pull forward effectively in H1 for the full year? Is that how we should think about it? Chuck Kyrish : Yes. So a large chunk of that is some of the footprint actions that we've taken. We've been building inventory now for a number of quarters. So I wouldn't look at it as kind of being a big benefit in Q2 in particular. It's kind of been a gradual uptick. We also just have some kind of normal - we have certain products that have campaign runs. And so, you'll have a little bit of an uptick from time-to-time, and then a down tick. So, I wouldn't look at it as being materially different for that piece than what we've typically seen. Salvator Tiano : Okay. Perfect. And the other thing I want to understand is that if I heard correctly, I think there was a comment that next year's synergies will be similar to this year's levels, which I believe we're still targeting $150 million. Firstly, is that correct? And secondly, if I go back to the initial co-synergies targets from your M&M slides, I believe there was more like a $50 million, $60 million, $70 million figure left. So how do you get to a number that's more than double that next year? Lori Ryerkerk : Yes. So let me clarify itself, because probably, my comments weren't clear before. If you look at '23, we had $100 million of synergies than if you look at '24, $150 million. And so my comment was, look, I don't have an exact number yet for '25, because we've been very focused on '24. But I think our synergy should be based on the actions that we're taking here this year in the same range as the last two years. So somewhere in that range. And then the remainder of the step-up in '25 is really the improved performance of acetyls tills with no force majeure, a full year of CLK productivity. And then we should have some further interest rate reductions. So, those are the things that I know about for 2025. But as I said, it's still too early to give any number with confidence on 2025. Salvator Tiano : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please state your question. Laurence Alexander : Good morning. I just want to confirm that the midpoint of your outlook, for the back half of the year is predicated, it looks like it's predicated on your automotive volumes being up like mid-single-digits, call it 2%, 3% above a flat to slightly positive auto build rate. Is that right? Lori Ryerkerk : We are expecting some uptick. Some moderate volume increase, I would say, in volumes into automotive. Laurence Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please state your question. Patrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You talked a little bit about the weaker non-contracted sales for tow. How meaningful is this in terms of typical to sales? How is the contract side of the business performing? And what are your medium-term supply and demand expectations for the tow business? Scott Richardson : I mean, tow business has been very stable, Patrick. And the contracted piece of the business has performed as expected. Again, as I mentioned earlier, the noncontract part is a small percentage. It's just we did see a little bit of inventory reduction from our customers in that part of the sector during the second quarter. So, it we don't expect it necessarily to continue going forward. Patrick Cunningham : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just within nylon, you touched on this a little bit, but can you just talk about the contemporary business model here, how you feel it performs, how you're maybe thinking about the footprint, if we see further pressure from here? And on the flip side, would you put incremental costs back into this business if demand improves, or the make versus buy economics change? Scott Richardson : Look, we're really proud of the team. I mean the team has come together and embraced a different way of operating here. And we're taking the ideas really across each function in the organization to really go and build out a model that we can be proud of that can deliver greater than 25% EBITDA in any economic environment and that's our target. We're early innings. I mean we've had some good success. We're seeing margin expansion, as we talked about. We're seeing nice wins coming from our project pipeline, but we have to continue to work the cost side of the equation. We have to continue to focus on really bringing our organization together to embrace the pipeline model and continue to elevate the returns that we're getting overall from the business. So depending on what the market gives us, we're going to have to pit it, much like we do in other parts of our business, both in acetyls and EM. And it's building those muscles to be able to adapt as things change from quarter-to-quarter. Patrick Cunningham : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho Securities. Please state your question. John Roberts : Thank you. Just going back to nylon and China here. They have a lot of producers who serve both the plastics and fiber markets. And given the weak carpet and textile markets, are you seeing some of that China nylon shift from fiber to plastics. I know some applications can't switch, but I thought there was enough that could switch that maybe that would be pressuring the market. Scott Richardson : John, that's really not where we're seeing the pressure from. I mean there's a lot of consistent players in the plastics market. So I wouldn't say that's been a material issue. John Roberts : Got it. Thank you. Bill Cunningham : Diego, we'll make the next question, our last one, please. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for today comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question. John McNulty : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So Lori, I think you said of the original $150 million that you expected to get from lower raw materials kind of working through, you're going to get about half that. Does the other half get pushed out into 2025? Or is it really just an opportunity that just given the circumstances you're just not going to be able to capture, I guess, how should we be thinking about that? Lori Ryerkerk : I would think about it as we weren't able to capture it here. There's no guarantee it will be there next year. If you think about the cost of inventory we're building right now will be what we see in the first half of next year, at least in the Engineered Materials. So I can't count on that for next year. I mean, we just have to see how cost of inventory goes for the rest of this year. John McNulty : Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess with regard to the acetic acid capacity that came on in China, the two new world-scale plants, I think like one of the issues was that you didn't see a whole lot of the downstream assets come on yet, and I think that was putting pressure on acetic acid prices. Can you give us an update as to whether or not those downstream assets have come on yet? And if they if they haven't, does that mute the ability for growth, or improvement in the market even as China construction starts to come back on and some of the downstream demand starts to come back on? I guess how should we be thinking about that? Lori Ryerkerk : So John, some of the uses that those plants were expected to serve were things like caprolactam, which is new, PVOH, EVA, I'm not sure about the capital action plan, if I'm honest. But PVOH, I think, is up and okay. EVA is up from what we know, but honestly, EVA demand right now or not EVA demand, but utilization of the EVA plants has gone to 7% or below from what we know. So again, just because of the softness right now in solar panels. And so, I think while it may be up, we're not seeing those plants consuming the volume of VAM that we would normally expect. Scott Richardson : Yes. John, really, the real cause of that is the end-user demand, particularly paints, coatings, construction and some of the solar space, as Lori mentioned, are just are weak. And so yes, while we've seen capacity come on in acetic acid and pricing kind of up and down, our margins have been largely stable now for quite a while. We've seen compression in VAM margins because that construction sector as well as solar has been so weak. So I think that's more of kind of where that compression has been seen. John McNulty : Got it. Thanks very much for the color Operator : Thank you. And I'll now hand the floor back to Bill Cunningham for closing remarks. Bill Cunningham : Thank you. We'd like to thank everyone for listening in today. As always, we're available after the call for any follow-up questions. Diego, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference. All parties may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

A question-and-answer session will follow the opening remarks [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Bill Cunningham : Thank you. Welcome to the Celanese Corporation third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Bill Cunningham, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today are Lori Ryerkerk, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Richardson, Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Kyrish, Chief Financial Officer. Celanese distributed its third quarter earnings release via Business Wire and posted prepared comments on our Investor Relations Web site yesterday afternoon. As a reminder, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures today. You can find definitions of these measures as well as reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures on our Web site. Today's presentation will also include forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements, which can be found at the end of both the press release and the prepared comments. Form 8-K reports containing all these materials have also been submitted to the SEC. Before we open it for questions, I'd like to turn the call over to Lori Ryerkerk for some opening remarks. Lori Ryerkerk : Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone. As Bill said, before we get started with questions today, I wanted to take a moment to emphasize a few key points. First, it is clear from our prepared comments that our results for Q3 were disappointing and the outlook for Q4 and into 2025 is below both our expectations and our goals. Despite the many actions that we've taken to continue to deliver value, the benefit from these measures has been increasingly offset by the broad and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. Given this dynamic, we intend to temporarily reduce our quarterly dividend beginning in the first quarter of 2025. While we recognize the importance of the dividend to our shareholders, we've carefully considered a variety of options and we have determined that this is the most prudent and cost effective measure to support our deleveraging efforts at this time. We will look forward to accelerating the return of capital to shareholders once we have progressed our deleveraging efforts. To further help us navigate this challenging environment, we have identified and will take additional bold actions to strengthen earnings and cash generation. We have a strong track record of delivery and operational excellence and are confident that we are taking the right actions. For example, we are significantly slowing production to match demand in Q4 and implementing further cost reductions, particularly in SG&A. We hold ourselves to a high standard and the steps that we are taking are driving durable improvements for the company as we build an increasingly disciplined cross structure and better position the business to drive long term growth. In closing, I want to thank our teams for their dedication and resilience in the face of persistent demand challenges in our end markets. I am confident that our actions have and will continue to position Celanese to create substantial value for our shareholders. We believe in Celanese's long term potential and we are leaving no stone unturned to capture opportunities that will benefit us both now and once demand begins to recover. With that, we'll open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Andrews : Wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a bridge in terms of the cash flow divestitures and how you're going to sort of delever over the next year or so? I'm assuming you're anticipating some improvement in the operating environment at some point, as well as divestitures and cost savings. But if you can just sort of bridge us from today maybe through '25 and into '26 in terms of what your expectations are? Lori Ryerkerk : So Vincent, obviously our first objective is to focus on EBIT. We don't know what the environment is going to be next year. So in that way, our focus is really on the cost reduction initiatives I talked about as well as doing things to really fill the project pipeline and make sure that we're generating additional business. I think as we called out in the prepared comments, we would see, even at today's environment, being near a more typical level because we did have a lot of one offs in cash flow this year. A more typical level that would yield about $800 million to $900 million. Obviously, with the steps we're taking, we would hope for some additional cash flow generated from that. We continue to focus on divestitures. And timing is uncertain, which is why we never really figure them into our free cash flow statement. But we do remain very focused on opportunistic divestitures where we can find someone who values our assets more than we do. So maybe I can turn it over to Chuck and he can add any additional color. Chuck Kyrish : Yes, and I think that's right, Lori. And Vincent, we have this prepayable term loan that we can deleverage throughout the course of next year as we generate cash and any other cash sources. So we've got the facilities in place to use that cash to continue to deleverage. And we remain committed -- we remain strong committed to deleveraging the balance sheet to 3 times net debt to EBITDA as fast as we can get there. We've talked a lot about significant actions underway to underscore that, right? Additional cost actions that we've announced, continued CapEx reduction and focusing on maintenance, reliability, safety, we're working divestitures as Lori said, divestitures that make sense. And obviously, the significant announcement of our intention to reduce our dividend starting in Q1. So that's what we're focused on is deleveraging the balance sheet down to 3 times net debt to EBITDA and we put things in place to be able to do that. Vincent Andrews : And if I could just follow-up on the Clear Lake. There's supposed to be $100 million of benefit that's going to come from starting up that asset. If I read the prepared comments correctly, I believe there was $20 million in the third quarter. So first, is that correct? And then second, what is sort of the bridge to getting between the $20 million, if I'm correct, and the $100 million? Lori Ryerkerk : On Clear Lake, you may recall we called out about $10 million in the first quarter and then $20 million now in the third quarter, we would expect some additional amount in the fourth quarter as well. We still think the benefit of Clear Lake is on a 100 range on a full year basis. And so we would expect to see the majority of that then occur next year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Mike Leithead : I wanted to start, Lori, at a high level, I think the magnitude and abruptness of the decline in the second half of the year was a bit surprising. So can you help contextualize or just help us better understand sort of how the past three months progressed relative to your expectation and sort of when order books really started to deviate versus your expectations, and you realize you need to pivot here on your production and your cash management? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me give you just a little bit of color. So when we made the guidance last quarter, we were coming off a stronger June, things we're looking a little bit stronger into the second half and in discussions with our customers, particularly auto, industrial, we were expecting some lift in those segments and across, and of course, we were seeing the impact of synergies and other things. I would say as we went through the quarter, we continue to see further pressure specifically on auto and on industrial. I think as an example and if we look at European registration of autos, they fell from June to August. So I would say really starting to see the big impact of that in August. I think we've seen the OEM announcements from Mercedes and Volkswagen, and everyone, which suggests maybe that situation isn't getting quicker anytime soon. Even if you look at full second quarter to third quarter, European auto builds were down 14%. So that's really where we started to see the big impact is as we worked our way through the quarter and frankly, conditions just continue to worsen, as we went through the quarter, including then in the US where we started to see announcements from Stellantis and GM. Mike Leithead : And on the dividend, I appreciate we're at day one here, but you emphasized in the prepared remarks the temporary nature of this reduction. Is there a specific leverage target or earnings level that you're initially aiming at or how long you want to keep the dividend at this level or will we need to see how cash flow evolves over the next year or so here? Lori Ryerkerk : Mike, our focus is really laser focused right now on getting to that 3 times leverage. And given the current market conditions that we're seeing and the fact that it looks like these are continuing into the early parts of 2025, at least, we felt the need to take further actions. And after a lot of consideration along with the board determined that reducing the dividend at this point was the most prudent and most cost effective options. So that's really where our focus will remain. It's driving activities to really rapidly deleverage to 3 time as quickly as we can. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Michael Sison : So when I take a look at the fourth quarter and the EBITDA outlook for EM, are you getting close to a write down for the M&M business, if not, why? And you have a lot of one-offs there. Do those sort of come back or do we sort of add that back as we head into the first quarter? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me address the second half of your question first. I mean -- so there are a number of one-offs in the fourth quarter and we would expect the destocking that we expect to see, the mix effects, the effects from affiliates inventory, we expect the vast majority of that to come back in the first quarter. And let me turn it over to Chuck to talk about our -- how we go through valuation and looking at write down. Chuck Kyrish : So third quarter each year is when we do test our goodwill and indefinite live intangibles. I'll remind you, goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, that's an engineering materials level. So we tested that quantitatively with the help of big four valuation specialists and we did not record an impairment. We did also test all the trade names of Engineered Materials individually with the same process and we did record a $34 million impairment on trade names, most of that was Zytel. So that kind of concluded our third quarter cycle of those testings. Michael Sison : And as a quick follow-up, if you think about 2025. Clearly, the end markets have impacted you all and everybody else in chemical is pretty negatively. If the environment doesn't improve in 2025, how do you think EBITDA or earnings should shape up next year, given you do have some stuff within your control to get some upside? Lori Ryerkerk : Mike, I would start with -- if you look at the performance over the first three quarters of this year, we have seen quarter-on-quarter improvement in performance being driven by synergies being driven by our product pipeline, et cetera. Those things will be true next year as well. We'll have additional synergies next year. We are putting a lot of effort into really trying to accelerate the project pipeline. It has grown significantly versus a year ago. But clearly, in this current macroeconomic that's not sufficient to support the business growth that we expect. That, combined with our cost reduction programs, I would just say for 2025, there is so much uncertainty while we are going to take a lot of steps to help ourselves to really control what we can control whether that market environment gets better or deteriorate, what we see in terms of interest, there is a lot of open questions out there around 2025. And I think it's just simply too early to speak with any authority about 2025 expectations. Scott Richardson : So as we close 2024 and go into 2025, we have four priorities that we are focused on as an organization. Number one, reducing cost, making sure that we're scrutinizing every dollar that we spend and that we're being very deliberate and targeted with where we invest. Two, is deliver the synergies and make sure that, that number one is in addition to the synergies that we've already committed to. Number three, on the Engineered Materials side of things, is supercharge the pipeline. While we have had some good metrics, it's not been enough to offset the downside we've seen from some of the demand challenges. But we've got to continue to aggressively work with customers, continue to penetrate in nonautomotive sectors to where we increase our share of wallet there. And then the fourth area on the Acetyl Chain side of things, is really fully leverage this integrated model that we have to be able to ensure that we're driving profit every single day. And we know that's going to be different from one week to the next but we have to keep the focus on those four priorities. And if we see a change upward in the demand landscape, that's just going to lead to more upside. So our focus really is on those things that are within our own control right now. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Jeff Zekauskas : What would have been the consequences of you not cutting your dividend? And is the dividend cut based in a diminished expectation for longer term operating cash flows in '25 and '26, and what caused that? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me try to answer the second part first, Jeff. Look, our long term expectation for this business is no different than it's been. I mean, we still believe in the long term performance of our Acetyl and our EM businesses, including the acquisition. The challenge we've had is the current macroeconomic conditions and recent demand deterioration have really challenged both businesses. And because of that, we are taking all of these actions but we are not getting the cash flow we expected to be on the deleveraging plan that we had planned for. So looking at the dividend, we really did determine this was the most cost effective and prudent way to get back on that cadence of deleveraging that we wanted to do for our business and that's really what drove the decision around dividends. Jeff Zekauskas : And secondly, I think you spent roughly $125 million in cash costs for restructuring this year, you expect to spend that. What's your number for 2025? And then secondly, in your expectations about the auto markets, I mean wasn't IHS already expecting down auto production in Europe for the third quarter in July? I mean was the downturn in Europe really that unexpected? Scott Richardson : Let me answer the second question first, Jeff, and then I'll turn it over to Chuck. I mean, look, there are a variety of publications that we look at. And when we made our forecast for the quarter, there was still an expectation of a slight uptick that did come down relatively quickly to the end of July and early part of August, and there was that flip. And as Lori talked about then, we started to really see the acute change in car registrations and other data in the month of August. So that is really where we saw the bigger flip in expectations. And I think there was what has kind of materialized, I think, if there was an expectation in the second half of the year that there would be a list, and we saw a buildup in Q2 of inventories. And so what we've seen now in the end of the part of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter is customers destocking that inventory in preparation for lower builds and lower sales here in the second half of the year. Chuck Kyrish : Jeff, on the cash cost synergies, next year with [Indiscernible] to M&M, those are going to drop off probably about $50 million. Now we will have some cash costs from the new cost reduction actions that we announced. And so that's -- if we talked about greater than $75 million, the cash cost of that will be less than a one year payback. So I think when you roll it all up, total cash spend on cash cost synergies plus there's no cost actions somewhere pretty close to this year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Ghansham Panjabi : Lori, going back to your prepared comments and also the comments from this morning, weakness in China and autos, et cetera. And none of that is truly all that surprising relative to what your peers have been saying as well, but the dividend cut is. So going back to that component, is the dividend cut more a function of you not seeing or anticipating a recovery in 2025 relative to your initial plan or are you anticipating a much more worsening of the trend line, if you will, near term just given the uncertainty that's out there? How should we sort of think about those two dynamics? Lori Ryerkerk : I would think about it in two parts. One is the performance we've experienced in '24 and the reduction in free cash flow we've had in '24, although, we have sufficient cash for the debt that is due next year. We just aren't deleveraging as quickly as we like, right? Our EBITDA is lower. We haven't been able to pay down additional cash towards the debt. And then if you look at '25 and beyond there is so much uncertainty. We feel it's prudent to be prepared for that and to stay on track with our deleveraging plan. And again, the most cost effective and prudent way to do that is by reducing the dividend at this time. Ghansham Panjabi : And then going back to the delayed draw term loan. Was the dividend cut part of that sort of process in terms of securing that loan? Just trying to get some context behind that. And then separately, on the $75 million program targeting SG&A. Is that to adjust to the new baseline of volumes or are you still assuming some sort of recovery as it relates to the operating dynamics, '25, '26 onwards? Lori Ryerkerk : So let me answer the second part and then Chuck can answer the first part. So the $75 million is additional identified cost cutting to better adjust our SG&A organization towards the current level of demand. It's also -- we also believe as we get more efficient as our systems get more mature, now that we've gotten through our new system implementations. We also believe though it will be an area that will -- or a level we will be able to sustain even if we start to see some demand recovery. Chuck Kyrish : Ghansham, on your other question. Those two are not tied together. The delayed draw term loan is something was put in place to help us bridge those maturities. And the dividend cash is because we made a commitment to deleverage this balance sheet to 3 times, and we're not doing that as fast as we want to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Josh Spector : I was wondering if you could just talk about your view on the earnings power of Engineered Materials at this point. I guess if I look at 3Q, you were up year-on-year, your EBIT level volumes were up but that's supposed to be a bigger chunk of the synergy savings and maybe a bit before you're seeing some of the negatives of the actions you're taking in fourth quarter. So if you can maybe look at second half and talk about some of the puts and takes that we should be thinking about and some thoughts on the back of our heads are more around if there's something impaired around the nylon side of things, either pricing or share loss that means earnings are structurally lower than what we should have thought a year or two ago? Lori Ryerkerk : So that's a lot of thoughts in one question. So let me just talk about how I see, my view of the EM business. So the EM business, our long term view of the EM business has not changed. I mean we still feel we have the most unparalleled portfolio of engineered materials. We have a structure that really drives in a very disciplined way, new projects, growth into new customers, growth into new applications. And while we continue to improve all those as well as improve our cost structure, this is fundamentally a very good business, still in demand by our customers who demand innovation and who want to buy products from us. So what we're seeing is a short term turn down. I also wouldn't just focus on nylon. I mean PA66 is certainly challenged at this point with an oversupply of non-differentiated polymer. But I would say our focus on PA66 is really on the differentiated polymer, the compounding and that's why you've seen us take all of the steps that we've done. I would say for M&M, in particular, even if PA66 is less than we originally thought, many of the other parts of the acquisition, such as Mylar, or Vamac, or Hytrel or high temperature nylon are outperforming where we thought they'd be at this time. So in aggregate, we still see the value of the MM acquisition and the value of the total EM portfolio as being as strong as it ever will be once we get back to a more normalized demand condition. Josh Spector : Maybe one quick follow-up, just I guess, thinking about the synergy side then within 3Q. So I guess some context here is that volumes were up. Obviously, things deteriorated later in the quarter, but we didn't see the flow through in 2Q -- or in 3Q. So what offset that? If you think about the synergy, what were the minuses that led us to only up 10 in the quarter? A - Scott Richardson : Yes, I think there is some timing around inventory, Josh, that has rolled through both in the quarter as well on a year-over-year basis. So that played a role there. Also pricing. As we called out, we've seen degradation in standard grade pricing, which has been the other bigger offset. So I think those are the two biggest chunks. I think when you look at things on a year-over-year basis for the year end total, volume up, price/cost mix up positive, spending down. So another positive there. Offset currency, we've had some headwinds on currency year-over-year, both in the quarter and for the full year and then turnarounds in inventory. So I think that's where it's been offset. And so we do believe in the earnings power, as Laurie Lori talked about, but that doesn't mean we're just going to live with where we are today. And that's why we talked heavily about the actions we're going to take both in the business as well as the corporate level on cost and then continuing to aggressively work pipeline and drive close wins. So one of the big synergy areas we talked about for '25 and beyond is revenue synergies. And so we need to deliver on that going into next year to continue to uplift the possible earnings power of the business. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Arun Viswanathan : Maybe I could ask the Q4 guidance question again. So if we think about going from around 2.50 for Q3 or 2.44 down to $1.25 for Q4. Maybe could you break that out maybe into some buckets of seasonality and how much is associated with the inventory draw downs and maybe some incremental weakness in auto and industrial or any other end markets that would be helpful? Scott Richardson : So I think on the acetyl side of things, it's seasonality. So call it roughly in that $20 million range. So I'd put that to seasonality, Arun. On the corporate cost side of things, that's really timing of cost flow through there more than anything. And then it's really engineered materials and kind of looking at where we are there, and those are the big buckets we called out in the prepared comments. So destock of about $45 million, which is probably a little seasonality in that number. We have mix which is really all seasonality of about $15 million. Affiliates are down $15 million. Again, that one is more seasonality driven. And then you've got the inventory and absorption costs, which is really the balance there. So when you kind of put that in there in the Engineered Materials buckets, it's $30 million, maybe a little bit more than that, but seasonality from the affiliates in that mix bucket we talked about in addition to the acetyls number. Arun Viswanathan : So just taking that a step further into Q1 then. Do you anticipate these actions that you are taking on the inventory side to allow you to -- is that the complete inventory actions that you have to take? And so when you look into Q1, you won't necessarily have those drags and you also may have less seasonality so that could get you back closer to maybe $2 or so in Q1? Or how are you thinking about how that evolves and maybe some of the bad guys that won't repeat in Q1? Scott Richardson : Let me start kind of high level and I'll turn it to Chuck to provide details on inventory flow through. Look, we are constantly looking at really matching our production levels with where demand is at. And given where things are and a need here with what we've seen from a destock perspective to take plant rates down, bring inventory down. This is a level of inventory that we've been pretty clear we wanted to reduce for the year. We expected it to be split a little bit more balanced between Q3 and Q4, a little bit more Q4 heavy, given where we're at. And then we'll look at what plant rates need to look like in the fourth quarter depending on what the order book looks like and when we get to that point. Chuck Kyrish : Yes, I think it's going to be really important for us to manage to generate free cash flow that will make these decisions. And if we're [preferencing] cash flow, you could see some see some P&L from some of those cost flow throughs, but it's important for us to generate free cash flow here and deleverage this balance sheet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Unidentified Analyst : It's [Aziza] on for Frank. Just want to start off with Chinese VAM margins sitting at a decade low here with the lackluster demand and new capacity. How long are you guys thinking it might take to absorb? Lori Ryerkerk : Look, I think the reabsorption for acetyls is really going to depend on when we start to see demand recovery. I mean we've called out now for many quarters the reduction we've seen in the construction, paint and coatings market. We've also seen demand destruction for derivatives, particularly in China for things like EVA into the solar markets and some other. So it's pretty impossible now to predict like how quickly that can be reabsorbed. It really will -- it's more dependent at this point on the shape of demand going forward. Scott Richardson : Because of that unpredictability, it is absolutely imperative that the team continues to maximize daily where we're selling product and look at where those opportunities are. And so the team is being very surgical on looking at how we want to monetize the molecules of acetic acid, downstream into VAM and then into the derivatives and looking for, is it better to sell an emulsion, a powder, VAM. And given the challenges we've seen in VAM, we've moved further downstream and we'll continue to pivot up or down depending on where those opportunities are at. Unidentified Analyst : And I was just curious, what are your expectations for the fourth quarter and early read on to 2025? Lori Ryerkerk : Just to clarify, fourth quarter in general or fourth quarter for acetyls? Unidentified Analyst : In general, just raw material expectations for the company for the fourth quarter and 2025. Scott Richardson : Raw material right now for the fourth quarter is largely stable as we look at things today, but obviously, that can change. And I think a lot will depend upon where fundamental energy dynamics are at as we go into 2025. So we'll continue to remain flexible. One of the elements that we're focused on here at year end is reducing raw material inventory as well as finished goods inventory, which will give us the ability to be flexible depending on what happens with raws next year. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. David Begleiter : Laurie and Scott, going back to the comment on supercharging the portfolio or the project pipeline EM. This used to be a strength of this business from my perception, it's now being called out as an area of weakness. So obviously, the business has changed with DuPont. But what's really underlying the change and that it's gone from a position of strength to perhaps a position that needs to be improved? Scott Richardson : The pipeline model is still a position of strength, dated, and there's no question about that for us. And the stats that we have proved that. The size of projects being up over 30% year-over-year is a really good example. Our project win rates are also up since the acquisition. And so the issue we're seeing now, though, is the amount of volume that's coming with each of those projects is smaller. In addition, the amount of challenges we've seen in the base has come both from a volume perspective and a pricing standpoint. So the pipeline needs to be enhanced and needs to be bigger in order to offset some of those headwinds that we're seeing. So when we talk about supercharging, it's not a confirmation on where things that it's just the opposite. It is a strength of this business. We feel like it can do more and we're going to continue to invest resources and partner with customers in a way that allows us to be successful, because we need the pipeline to be generating more in this environment. David Begleiter : And just on Singapore, given new supply in China, can Singapore be brought back online unless -- or do you need trying to recover strongly for Singapore to be brought back into production? Lori Ryerkerk : So we do expect that Singapore will come back online. I mean, Singapore is still economic to run, especially into the non-China Asia market. And remains an important part of our portfolio and very much in line with how we'd like to have the optionality about what we produce and where we produce and into what market. And so our expectation is that, and because it is so profitable, we do expect that portfolio, we'll continue to come online and run as needed. Fortunately, we have the flexibility there now because of the structure of our contracts that we can make that choice more than we did in the past. But much like we're using Frankfurt as kind of our swing VAM capacity, more and more we'll see Singapore becoming more of our swing acetic acid capacity. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey Yefremov : In EM, is the bigger issue that you're selling less volumes or is it that you're selling at lower prices? And are prices stable at this point or they're continuing to fall in Q4? Lori Ryerkerk : So Aleksey, it's both. I would say for differentiated products to keep -- the main impact has been around volume, because the pricing tends to be sticky. But for standard grade products, it's more of an issue around -- we're able to sell the volumes but the issue is around price and margin. Aleksey Yefremov : And also in EM, are you pulling inventory below normalized level in Q4 such that you may need to rebuild it in 2025 or you need to get back to your normal inventory seasonality at the year end? Scott Richardson : I would not expect we'll be below normalized levels, Aleksey, unless we see a change in demand levels. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citibank. Patrick Cunningham : I wanted to follow up on the project pipeline. It's encouraging to see the value per project has increased 30% since 2022. Are there any secular growth markets or applications where you're getting the most traction? And any strategic shift or change in thinking as how you approach auto OEM customer base given the recent weakness? Scott Richardson : Well, look, I think where we're seeing change in the mix of where -- who's winning from an OEM perspective. And as we think about this with China still growing and Chinese OEMs being more successful, a continued focus there in winning in China is very important. And so we have seen some wins just recently. We're very focused on the EV market. We've had really good traction in things like thermal management models, cooling houses, light weighting on the auto side of things. But then on the non-auto side of things, if you recall, this was one of our most important areas of synergies, really getting the M&M products into nonautomotive applications in a much bigger way. We did that historically in the Celanese Engineered Materials portfolio and we're heavy focused on it. We've had some wins in things like oil well pipes with flexible covers around those. Just recently, we've been heavily focused around high performance athletic shoes with some big wins there with products that are creating, particularly in running shoe applications, increased performance. And so really good uptick and those are global opportunities. And so the team is working on not just having these singular wins and focused heavily around once we get a win, sharing that translation opportunity across the globe so that we can be penetrating with each of these as much as possible in a much shorter time frame. The nice thing about nonautomotive is the projects tend to move through the pipeline quicker. And so that's why that heavy focus around non-auto is really important as we go into '25 and '26. Lori Ryerkerk : I would add, one of the sectors that Scott didn't talk about that we're very excited about is electrical and electronics. And if you think about the demand for electricity current outlook is that that's going to double over the next five years, and that requires a lot of build-out of electrical infrastructure. And we are seeing the pull through of polymer demand as part of that build out. Patrick Cunningham : How committed is Celanese [indiscernible] grade rating? Would you consider issuing additional equity to preserve this rating or do you believe the current steps you've taken are enough? Scott Richardson : We're committed to deleveraging this balance sheet to 3 times net debt to EBITDA as fast as we can to get it there. As Lori mentioned, we've assessed a variety of options to support that and determine what the support of the Board that -- but given the challenging environment and our goals that the announcement of our intention to reduce the dividend was the prudent action to take. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Kevin McCarthy : Just to follow up on the prior question. If I look at your term structure, you've got the billion senior unsecured notes in March that presumably the delay draw term loan will take care of. But beyond that 1.5 billion in '26 and 3.4 billion in '27 in. So to get to that three turns of leverage goal based on the current glide path of EBITDA, it seems like you've got some heavy lifting ahead. And so would you consider a mandatory convert and/or acceleration of the divestiture options to try to take some of the pressure off your ongoing efforts to deleverage? Scott Richardson : Well, we're working divestitures as aggressive as we can, the ones that make sense, Kevin, and the timing of this could be uncertain. I think the other thing you mentioned kind of falls in the category of other things that we have considered, right? So -- and again, kind of -- for the Board took the path of -- intention to reduce the dividend. I mean, I think looking forward to those maturities, we've got access to various outlets in the capital markets and we're going to deleverage with the cash that we generate and the cash that we achieved through any things like divestitures, and we'll look and see what the prudent approach is on our capital structure with these access to various capital markets, outlets and balance cost and risk on that and our capital structure at all times. Kevin McCarthy : As a second question, if I may, a lot of chemical companies are reviewing their asset footprints, particularly so in Europe, as you know. I think in years past, Celanese took a hard look at Asia. Lori, and listening to your comments, it sounds to me like you're thinking of Singapore as a keeper, so to speak. I would like to ask you more broadly though, do you have plans to reexamine the asset footprint anywhere in the world or are we going to play the cards we're dealt, so to speak, for the near term? Lori Ryerkerk : I'd say Celanese has always been known for being very aggressive about footprint optimization and we look at it continuously. I mean if you go back over even just the five years I've been here, we have we have made decisions around shutting down, reoptimizing our footprint, something almost every year. Now that we have added the assets from the M&M acquisition, we have been going through that process again. And you've already seen us make announcement around intro and facility in Argentina and some other facilities around the world. And we are really looking now on a combined basis what does that footprint optimization look like. Again, you've seen some of the announcements we've already made. Mechelen, which will be shut down now in 2025, that activity will continue because it's what we normally do. We constantly reassess and reevaluate what is the right footprint for us given where our customers are and what our demand profiles look like? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Hassan Ahmed : A question around -- I mean, you guys have always done a very good job at matching production with demand. And obviously, it seems Q3 and Q4 of this year -- from the commentary, it seems auto production kind of surprised you guys and the like. So just a broader question around just forecasting how you guys are looking at the order books, forecasting based off of that, particularly in light of what appears to be significant changes in customer buying patterns, how customers are thinking, it seems buying patterns are more just in time. It seems customers through lessons learned through COVID or keeping leaner and leaner inventory levels. So are you -- do you think those customer habits are sustainable on a go forward basis or just a function of this erratic sort of macro we're in? And how are you guys adapting in terms of forecasting and matching sort of your production with that demand in this environment? Lori Ryerkerk : Let me ask Scott to address the broader question. But I would just say, really, if you look at the inventory situation we have in the third quarter, we had really been building inventory across the first half for two reasons. One, an expectation, particularly in auto of an upturn in the second half, which is being called out by the majority of our customers and the indices, as well as we had built some inventory because we were doing footprint optimization. So we were building inventory so that we could shut facilities down and switch customers to new facilities. When we got into third quarter, we acquired raw materials, anticipating a normal level of builds, if you will. And then when we saw demand really dropped down midway through the quarter, we slowed production now but we still sit there. So a lot of the inventory we built in the third quarter was actually around raw. So there's some very specific dynamics around third quarter. But I mean, your question is a fair one, which is how are we looking at customer demand and forecasting because it is changing slightly. So let me hand that to Scott. Scott Richardson : Hassan, we have to remain very flexible. And now that we're all on one system with the M&M business coming into the Celanese system in the first quarter, we are going through a process of really looking at where we make and how we make and run our network from an optimized basis right now. And we're overlaying that with the changes that you kind of alluded to that are happening more or less in the Western Hemisphere. The one thing you didn't mention that we also have to be very cognizant of is the rapid pace of change on who's winning, particularly in automotive in China. We've seen over the last year a rapid change of the Chinese OEMs taking a bigger share there. That has also driven an inventory rebalancing at the end user, customer base, that then we're feeling now. And so we've got to make sure that we have adapted and our manufacturing footprint and how we operate our assets to where we need that product. And as we go forward, at least in the short term, it's probably going to be a little heavier towards Asia. And so optimizing those assets and making sure that we can respond to customer needs very quickly is something that the team is very much focused on. Hassan Ahmed : And as a follow-up, obviously, a lot of questions around EM. So I want to change gears a little bit and move to acetyls chain. The prepared remarks in reading those, it seemed you guys -- obviously, you guys reported continued sort of strong margins in that segment despite the headwinds the macro brings. And you guys talked about the sustainability of those margins within the Acetyl Chain segment. What gives you guys the sort of comfort level in sort of believing that those margins are actually sustainable on a go-forward basis? Scott Richardson : Hassan, I think a lot of it is global trade flows and what we've seen and how things have transpired and where the global cost curves sit, particularly on the upstream part of the value chain. And so I do believe we've been able to exhibit resilience in that part of the value chain. And then as you get further downstream, the amount of flexibility that we have in that part of the chain is a lot more than it ever has been before. And so the team has a lot more choices on where they can pivot, which does enhance our ability to drive earnings power, and some of that may just be offsetting headwinds. But because of that flexibility, we do believe that the sustainability margins in these ranges is kind of where we think they'll be. Lori Ryerkerk : And I would call out two additional factors. One is we do have an advantaged technology for acetic acids, which gives us some cost advantage as well. And then we have a very advantaged cost footprint in the US Gulf Coast with our largest acetic plant there, which we believe is the lowest cost and lowest carbon -- acetic acid plant in the world today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Matthew Blair : Can we circle back to the potential asset sales and could you say, would they be more targeted to the EM segment or the Acetyl Chain segment? And then also on a regional basis, are you looking to sell assets in Europe or would this be kind of all over include US and Asia as well? Lori Ryerkerk : Well, on divestitures, we have had a very robust look and a list of possible divestitures that we've been looking at, multiple opportunities for various sizes as we talked about on the call last quarter. I would say we tend to look at these more in line with not as much even just specific assets as necessarily as you've seen us do in the past, maybe joint ventures or a very specific product line that we no longer fit with our portfolio or where someone values it more. So it's a combination of all of those things. So because of that, I wouldn't say it's really focused on any one region, although like our footprint optimization has been very focused on Europe, but even there, you've seen us do things throughout various regions. So this is just really looking at what's the best fit for us going forward and where do we have assets that may be of more value to others. Matthew Blair : And then could you also talk about what you're seeing in the European auto market so far in the fourth quarter? It looks like Germany new car registrations picked up a little bit in October but some of the other markets might be a little sluggish. Does that match with what you're seeing as well? Scott Richardson : We've taken the most recent data, Matthew, into our forecast that we're guiding to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho Securities. John Roberts : Back in 2018, Celanese and Blackstone drop plans to merge [Acetow]. Do you think the environment has changed enough or maybe a different structure like a manufacturing JV might allow that opportunity to come back? Lori Ryerkerk : We've talked about this a lot, John. I would say we don't see any opportunities there for tow. I mean, since we've been able to integrate it into the full Acetyl Chain, we do think that's the best place for it, that allows us to operate it as part of the chain and maximize the value of the chain. And I think the things that prevented that from happening back in '18 in terms of regulatory concerns still exist today. So I don't see that that's changed. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Salvator Tiano with Bank of America. Salvator Tiano : So firstly, I want to trickle a bit. What are the lessons learned or what are the actions you intend to take going forward when it comes to things such as financial planning, forecasting guidance? Because coming back to one of the questions ask being earlier about auto builds and recognizing that at the day of the guidance of your Q2 results, S&P IHS was showing different numbers, of course. There were several other, I guess data points, including old suppliers that have very much outright said that auto builds are moving lower. So it was something that essentially, I guess, should have been expected. And the same goes to the whole Acetyl Chain margin, where I think we've had a lot of discussions about new acetic acid and VAM supply this year and next, which haven't -- which didn't appear like it was taken in account as much at the beginning of the year. So given that and in hindsight, what are the -- what can be done to improve the forecasting here? Scott Richardson : Look, Sal, we're going to continue to use the data that -- a variety of data sources to drive inputs into our forecast. We also use customer forecast as well. I think one of the things that we always adjust and we'll continue to adjust in this environment is how much we use historical statistics to be able to drive forecasting, just because in periods where demand is more volatile, that changes. And so we will continue to take that into account as we make our forecast. Salvator Tiano : And I just wanted to clarify a little bit for next year. It seems to us that there is both on acetyl and on VAM more capacity underlying in Asia. So is it fair to say that absent the Clear Lake contribution, the other whatever $50 million or so you get or other cost cutting measures, we should expect Acetyl earnings to be down in 2025 versus 2024? Scott Richardson : Look, Sal, I wouldn't make any assumptions as of yet. As we've talked about, it's still early and looking ahead. Lori mentioned earlier what we would expect to get from Clear Lake. We're just going to have to see where demand is at and particularly in Asia, to see kind of where the margin levels will be as we get into next year. And we'll provide more color on that when we get to the call in Q1. Bill Cunningham : Well, thank you, everyone. We would like to thank everyone for listening today. As always, we're available after the call for any follow-up questions. Darrel, please go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
