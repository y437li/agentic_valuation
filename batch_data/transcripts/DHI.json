Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States First Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Donald Tomnitz, President and CEO for D.R. Horton. Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz, you may begin. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you, and good morning. Joining me this morning are Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Stacey Dwyer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer; and Mike Murray, Senior Vice President. Before we get started, as usual, Stacey? Stacey H. Dwyer: Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there's no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: D.R. Horton is off to a strong start in fiscal 2014. Our first quarter results were highlighted by $189.7 million of pretax income, on $1.7 billion of revenues and a pretax operating margin of 11.4%. Our home sales gross margin improved 350 basis points year-over-year to our highest level since 2006, setting a firm foundation for a strong profitability as volume grows. Housing market conditions continue to improve across most of our operating markets and we are optimistic about the upcoming spring selling season. We are prepared for spring with attractive communities in great locations and a strong supply of finished lots and homes in inventory to capture the expected increase in demand. Our weekly sales pace accelerated in January as compared to the first quarter, which could be an early sign of strong demand to come in the spring. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: In the first quarter, our consolidated pretax income increased 76% to $189.7 million from $107.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 11.4%, an increase of 290 basis points from 8.5% in the year-ago quarter. Homebuilding pretax income more than doubled to $181.9 million from $90.2 million, and financial services pretax income was $7.8 million compared to $17.7 million. Net income for the first quarter increased 86% to $123.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share, compared to $66.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 33% to $1.6 billion on 6,188 homes closed, up from $1.2 billion on 5,182 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $263,500, up 12% compared to the prior year driven by pricing power and an increased mix of larger move-up homes. Stacey? Stacey H. Dwyer: The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 14% to $1.5 billion. Homes sold increased 4% to 5,454 homes, and our average selling price increased 10% to $275,600. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 23% compared to 22% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 20% from a year ago to $2.1 billion with an average sales price per home of $275,100, and homes in backlog increased 5% to 7,684 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter was 75%. We are ready for the spring selling season with a strong supply of homes available to close by March, so we expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, which is higher than our second quarter historical conversion rate. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 22.3%, up 350 basis points from the year-ago period. 200 basis points of the margin increase was due to improved market conditions resulting in reduced incentives and higher selling prices in excess of cost increases. 110 basis points was due to lower relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue, and the remaining 40 basis points of the margin increase was due to lower amortized interest in property taxes. We have invested in attractively priced land and lots over the last 2 years and we continue to see solid demand and improved pricing in many of our markets. Based on current market conditions, we expect our gross margins to continue at a strong level. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $183.4 million compared to $140.8 million in the prior-year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 20 basis points to 11.2% from 11.4%. We continue to leverage our fixed cost structure, while at the same time building our sales and production capabilities where necessary. We expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to increase seasonally in the second quarter before trending lower in the third and fourth quarters with higher expected revenues. The improvements in our gross profit percentage and SG&A expense ratio expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 11.1% in the current quarter, an increase of 380 basis points from 7.3% in the year-ago quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $7.8 million, down from $17.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter reflected a more competitive pricing environment, whereas the year-ago quarter benefited from unusually favorable market conditions, which produced higher than normal gains on sale of mortgages. 88% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of our mortgage company's volume this quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 41% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Since September, our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $224 million. We had 16,800 homes in inventory at the end of December, of which 1,400 were models, 9,300 were speculative homes and 3,400 of the specs were completed. Our average community count for the quarter increased 13% from a year ago. In our first fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development totaled $467 million, of which $254 million was for land development, and $213 million was to purchase finished lots and land. At December 31, 2013, we owned 126,000 lots and controlled 49,000 lots through option contracts. 61,000 of our lots are finished, of which 33,500 are owned and 27,500 are optioned. We are well positioned to meet demand with our 175,000 total lots owned and controlled. Mike? Mike Murray : In October, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Regent Homes for $34.5 million in cash. Regent operates in Charlotte, Greensboro and Winston Salem, North Carolina. At the date of acquisition, we acquired approximately 240 homes in inventory, 300 lots and control of an additional 600 lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 213 homes valued at $31.1 million. Our first quarter results include 76 net sales and 136 closings in Regent's operations. Stacey? Stacey H. Dwyer: Our unrestricted homebuilding cash totaled $801 million at quarter end. At December 31, we had available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $656 million and no cash borrowings outstanding. Our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash, was 37.1% and our gross homebuilding leverage was 43.8%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3.3 billion. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid the remaining $145.9 million principal amount of our 6 1/8% senior notes at maturity. Our $500 million principal amount of convertible notes mature in May. These notes are eligible for conversion into equity if our stock price is at or above $12.96. If the notes convert, we intend to settle them with common stock. In January, our Board of Directors approved a payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.0375 per share payable on February 18 to shareholders of record on February 7. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: In closing, this quarter was D.R. Horton's most profitable first quarter since 2006 with $189.7 million of pretax income. The majority of our operating metrics continued to improve on a year-over-year basis this quarter. The value of our sales, closings and backlog increased by 14%, 33% and 20%, respectively. Our pretax income increased 76%. Our pretax income margin increased 290 basis points to 11.4%. Our gross margin on home sales revenues increased 350 basis points. Our SG&A, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, improved 20 basis points. Our average sales price increased 10%, as we experienced pricing power in many of our markets. We are better prepared this year than we have been for any recent spring selling season. We have a strong finished lot position and an attractive cost basis. And we continue to bring new communities to market, which reflect extraordinarily competitive finished lot costs due to our excellent low-cost land purchases over the last several years. January sales are accelerating into the spring and we have a supply of spec homes available to meet that demand. We look forward to a very strong spring selling season. We'd like to personally thank all the D.R. Horton team, let's keep the momentum from January going. This concludes our prepared remarks and now, we'll host any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : So my first question was actually on absorptions. And if I got the numbers right, it seems like absorptions were down kind of high-single digits, community counts up, and obviously, pricing is very, very strong in the backlog and in terms of order growth. Should we see that as kind of a little bit of a change strategically, that you're going to let absorptions be a little bit lighter year-over-year maybe, if that's the way it falls out but you're going to hold pricing? Or is the commitment still very much --, \"Let's make sure we drive absorptions through the system and through the communities?\" Maybe you can just kind of talk about the balance at this point? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think where we are clearly -- and it's the same place where we were at the end of the fourth quarter -- and that is, we're holding our pricing strong and firm going into the strong selling season. And we feel like there's a limited supply of new homes on the market. And I think as we move into the strong selling season, that we'll be able to continue to maintain our pricing, if not slightly increase it. So we don't see any real reason, as we said at the end of the fourth quarter, David, to begin discounting early. There's no use to get -- to overreact. We think we're in an extraordinarily strong position. And based upon our sales in January and especially this last week, we feel very good about the strong spring selling season and our ability to continue to maintain our pricing stability and raise prices. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : That's very helpful. And then, maybe you guys can comment on the Regent Homes deal. If I got the numbers correctly in the dialogue, in the prepared remarks, they just overbooked, it sounded like, maybe slight premiums were up booked. What's the deal flow look like, especially kind of after the second half last year, a little bit of uncertainty heading into this year? Are you finding the deal flow will pick up in terms of M&A? And the willingness of, maybe, private builders to be flexible on pricing? Is that changing out there now? Bill W. Wheat: We are seeing a lot of opportunities as we have been and we're evaluating them. There was a bit of a pause in the sales environment late last summer into the early fall. And that perhaps did bring a few more people to coming out and trying to look at their alternatives and options. So we continue to look at opportunities, and hopefully, we'll continue to be successful finding the right acquisitions. We're not stressed to have to do any one given deal. We're looking for the right thing that fits strategically with what we see as a company and improving our footprint and our capabilities. Operator : Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : It was interesting to note in your prepared remarks -- in your press release, you specifically called out the move-up buyer as an area of strength. I was just wondering if you could elaborate that a little bit more, and also address what you're seeing in the first-time buyer? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, clearly, we opened Emerald Homes probably about 6 months -- or actually longer than that, 9 months ago -- and we're bringing that into fruition in a number of our divisions and that's focusing on the higher end. And that product line has met with a lot of strong demand in the marketplace and we're expanding that into more and more divisions. And we expect to continue to grow that to the point where it will become a significant portion of the corporation on a go-forward basis. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, so but... Stacey H. Dwyer: And in terms of the first-time buyer, though, I mean, I don't ever want people to think that, that's not a core part of our business as well. The first-time buyer and the first-time move-up buyer have been our bread-and-butter for many, many years and we're going to continue to focus on those segments as well. But we have seen an opportunity to expand our product offerings so we're offering more things to more people in many of our markets. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I guess from a demand perspective, can you discern any different trends between the segments? Stacey H. Dwyer: I think we're seeing some improvement in the move-up simply because we've added that product line. And so it's really hard for us to gauge what the incremental demand in that is. Overall, for our business, it's been an increasing portion of demand. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then, when you -- Don, it sounded to me like when you're -- your tone, when you're talking about acceleration into January that, that was a little bit more than you might see normally. Is that correct? Donald J. Tomnitz: I would relate it to, specifically, my expectations. And as you know, I'm a more conservative person. So I would tell you that in January and especially this last week, that our sales have been better than I had expected. And I'm excited about where we are and I feel like that we're right on the cusp of a strong selling, spring selling season. And from my own personal perspective, I think the spring selling season has started a little early for our company and that's a very positive thing that I'm seeing. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Can you just talk about specific trends during the quarter? Was any 1 month particularly better? And if so, what do you think drove that? Was there -- it sounded like you didn't increase your incentives at all. So what did you see as the quarter played out? Bill W. Wheat: Really, our sales pace through the quarter was fairly consistent. Each month of the quarter was up on a year-over-year basis. So we saw just very consistent sales trends and then we've seen that accelerate in the month of January. Donald J. Tomnitz: I also think that the buyer is becoming more accustomed to the current mortgage rates. If you recall back a couple of quarters ago, there was a pretty adverse reaction to the increase in mortgage rates even though they were slight and they're still historically low by anybody's standards. But frankly, over the last 4 to 6 months, the buyers have become accustomed to the mortgage rates and I think that, that will be less and less a factor as we move into the spring selling season and fiscal year '14. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : And you see that in terms of your traffic as well? The traffic has accelerated? Donald J. Tomnitz: Yes. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got you. Then the last question is -- quickly. Can you help us frame how we should be thinking about rising rates and really the impact on your business? Obviously, we don't expect another spike in rates but we should have higher this year alongside, obviously, the Fed tapering. At what point should we expect to see a more notable impact on your business? And should we expect you to increase your focus on move-up luxury buyers in anticipation of rates going up? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I personally believe that rates are going up, as I've said for a number of quarters, although they haven't gone up significantly. I don't believe rates are going to go up significantly. And the way I look at it today, the affordability index is still at one of the highest it's been in many, many years. I look at current opportunity for the buyers to buy a home at still reasonable prices relative to where they've been on a historical basis. And where the mortgage rates are, that it's certainly a great time to buy a home. And I think that a lot of buyers are continuing to accept that and believe that. Stacey H. Dwyer: And we've looked at numerous charts over the past few years and the tightest correlation in terms of new home sales isn't with interest rates, it's with jobs. And so if interest rates are rising because the economy is improving, because more people are employed, we view that as a strong positive boost[ph] for our business. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : It sounds that you're in great shape in terms of being prepared for the demand in the spring season. I was wondering, Stacey, you'd talked about the higher backlog conversion based on the specs there for the March quarter. I was wondering, how much of that in terms of what you're doing in specs is really for the first-time buyers in terms of. Let's call it, the 2/5 of the business there versus higher price points? And with the first-time buyers, what are you typically seeing in terms of timing from contracts on into closing? Stacey H. Dwyer: More of our specs are probably going to be targeted toward the first-time buyer and the first time move-up buyer. In terms of time to contract, I don't think we're seeing anything that's significantly different. We had expected, as the economy recoveries and the demand recovers, that we'd see more build-to-order, and we actually did see our backlog conversion rates slowing down some. We're still running above historical trends and we're still seeing more compacted contract to close than we've seen historically. Bill W. Wheat: And still, with the number of changes in the mortgage underwriting guidelines, it's taking longer to qualify a buyer than what it has in the past. And we're processing those as quickly and as efficiently as we possibly can, but that is a slowing process to our business. Daniel Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great. And then, in terms of the comments in terms of the better trends in January, especially this past week. Any regional color you can offer in terms of just where you saw pockets of strength? Donald J. Tomnitz: Dan, I've passed that stage in my life. I'm going to pass on that question. This we -- we just look at the business overall and I'll leave it other people to make the commentaries on the various markets and grade the markets. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First question, just wanted to dig in a little bit more, Don, on your comments regarding sales trends in January and how you're thinking about the spring. Given that sales pace is still down year-over-year, obviously, with some of the shorter-term comps and recent gyrations earlier this year with the mortgage environment, in terms of your expectations, you're obviously, looking forward, as you said, to a strong spring selling season. But as that comps against last year, where it was also a very strong selling season, are you thinking more that you'd be happy matching on a sales per community basis, the results of the year-ago and that would certainly qualify as a strong season? Or are you actually looking for year-over-year improvement on a sales pace basis? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, we're constantly looking for year-over-year improvements on the sales basis, but to your specific question, we're always trying to increase our absorptions on a per community basis. That's our best leverage of our SG&A and that's a focus in each one of our communities. So we are focusing on how we penetrate each market deeper, but also how we increase our absorptions on a community-by-community basis. Stacey H. Dwyer: I would add one thing on that. If you look at our West region, we actually have been raising our sales prices and really improving our operating margin, that we're not focused on absorptions in that region just because of the lot supply dynamics there. So there's always the nuance of we're going to approach our business differently based on the different market conditions everywhere. So again, it may not be a one-size-fits-all answer. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, and I appreciate that. And then, just some clarification, if possible. Don, you mentioned about SG&A, you expect it to increase seasonally in the second quarter. Just wanted to clarify if that was in dollars or on a percent of sales basis relative to 1Q? And also, if you could give what the community count was in the first quarter sequentially in year-over-year in terms of the growth as you have in the past? Donald J. Tomnitz: On the SG&A certainly as a percentage, but certainly not in terms of dollars. And if you'll notice that our Q1 SG&A dollars were down. So as a result, we expect the same thing to happen to us in the second quarter. Community count... Bill W. Wheat: Community count, on a sequential basis, our average community count was up 2%, and year-over-year was up 13%. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. But the SG&A as a percentage of sales versus 1Q, is that -- I mean, on a year-over-year, I'd assume you'll have leverage but sequentially, would that be up as well? Or... Donald J. Tomnitz: We think on a percentage basis, we'll be up because typically, our second quarter, we -- is our slowest quarter for closings. And if you take a look at our expectation on our backlog conversion, 75% would produce slightly fewer units in Q2 closed than what we did in Q1. So our SG&A, as a percentage of revenues will be slightly up. Bill W. Wheat: And that's our normal seasonality in terms of SG&A. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Don, you've talked a little bit about SG&A. If I step back and just look at all the costs that are rolling through. Your gross margin, when I backed out last quarter's warranty benefit, was up pretty significantly sequentially. One, did that surprise you? Two, what are the expectations moving forward relative to this past quarter in that? And then on your SG&A, what's driving that? We expect that it would drop a little bit more than what it's been dropping. Is it just your infrastructure build or are you using more dollars on brokers, et cetera, than expected? And sort of tied into that, what you all think about cost expectations as we go through to '14? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, on our gross margin basis, obviously, what we've been doing is we've been holding our prices steady even though the demand, if you look at our fourth quarter sales and our first quarter sales, we've been able to hold it, even in a slow part of the time period. And as Stacey had said earlier, clearly in the West region, as well as other regions, we are not discounting homes and we're maximizing our prices. So in terms of gross margins, our gross margins are basically close to their historical peak, but we don't think they're -- we're at peak pricing in most of our markets. We strongly believe one of the factors that will continue to improve our gross margins -- actually, 2 factors. One is our very competitive land positions that we're bringing to market in the form of finished lots. And secondly, if you take a look at what we think is a constrained or reduced demand or -- of inventory of homes out there for the expected demand, I think that we're going to have pricing power because of those 2 factors. But especially the limited amount of inventory that's prevalent in most of the markets today. I'll let you guys handle the SG&A. Bill W. Wheat: And in terms of SG&A, clearly, we are prepared for stronger volumes in 2014. So we have been building infrastructure on our sales teams and our production capabilities. And so from that standpoint, we definitely are prepared for some stronger volumes. And on a year-over-year basis, we did leverage it 20 basis points. So we are ahead of the pace that we set last year. In Q1, we finished the year at 10.7% last year so we're on pace to do better than that. Clearly, we're always looking to leverage SG&A as much as we possibly can. And our expectation is with higher volumes later in the year, that we will leverage it further. Donald J. Tomnitz: And to digress just for a moment, obviously we're expecting to close more units in fiscal year '14 than we did in fiscal year '13. So we've added -- we've had to add the additional SG&A particularly on the construction side to get our homes built and to have them available for the spring selling season. And as the market continues to improve, as we think it will, throughout the third and fourth quarters, we've got to have superintendents to deliver those homes. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. That is a very thorough answer for all of that. That helps me a lot. I appreciate it. And then just the other thing that I had, in your fiscal first quarter, if you look at it sequentially, your orders usually drop about 15%, 20% versus the fourth quarter. This time, they were up about 6%. Blending that with what you've said about the January commentary, is the result in the fourth quarter more a function of the fourth quarter improving -- or the first quarter improving, or the fourth quarter just being much weaker than normal? Donald J. Tomnitz: No. I think it's a function of the first quarter improving. Like I said, that improvement has continued over into the second quarter. And we're very happy, even though we're focusing on double-digit increases in all the important metrics, except for SG&A. The fact that we are up 4% in units and 14% in terms of dollars in our sales, we're very pleased with that. So we continue to feel like there's momentum building and we're pleased with those numbers. Operator : Our next question today is coming from James McCanless with Sterne Agee. James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask first on the community count growth numbers you gave. Should we expect that plus 13 or somewhere in that range to be the growth rate for the rest of the year? Bill W. Wheat: James, we would expect it to moderate a bit. We do expect our community count to continue to be up on a year-over-year basis, but it may not continue to be double-digit based on what we can see right now. But really, what will ultimately happen will depend on what we see in terms of the strength of the market as we get into the spring and later in the year, if they have -- if the strength exceeds our current expectations, we could end up adding some additional communities. But right now, we'd expect it to stay positive but perhaps not at the double-digit level. Donald J. Tomnitz: One of the factors in the marketplace today is that the number of markets have land prices reflecting continued increase in median house prices, and we're very, very pleased with our current land position because we bought before the prices ran up as dramatically as they have. And clearly, that's what we're expecting in terms of complement to our gross margins. Because we do have less expensive land than what the market is reflecting in terms of land prices today. Mike Murray : In each of the last 2 years, we've built our community count by double-digit percentages each of the last 2 years, so we've built up to a very good footprint to be prepared for this year. So we're in a very good position and really don't feel the urgency to have to continue to increase our community count at the same pace. Donald J. Tomnitz: And that's reflected in our first quarter land spend because basically we had -- what $45 million worth of land spend in the first quarter. So that's less than what we've had for quite some time. Mike Murray : And the total land and finished lots are $213 million. That is moderating from where we've been. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : A few questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the spec situation. I guess, first, you talked about the fact that you've got, I think you said 9,300 specs, and that positions you well. A lot of times, when you have a lot of specs, people sometimes, in previous times, say that \"Oh, it's a bad thing.\" Because that means you're going to have to discount. But in periods where the demand is very strong, you really don't have to discount that much. So, I guess, if you could help us understand, if sales progress through the first quarter are, let's say, a little lighter than you anticipate, would there be a point where you might feel you have to sort of accelerate the discounting on those units? And what sort of scenarios embedded in your expectation since you're going to be having more specs as a percentage of deliveries, I would think, than you did for some time? Donald J. Tomnitz: First of all, we're in a very strong position given our specs. Although our specs as a percentage of our total inventory are nowhere near what our peak specs were at one point in time as a percentage of our inventory, our specs as a percentage of inventory increased from 53% to 56% sequentially, which is normal process, so that we get ready for the spring selling season. But we don't share your concern about a weak selling season. I think there's going to be a strong selling season. But, Kim, to your specific point, if there were such, currently, our spec gross margins are continuing to exceed our build job gross margins. So we feel like that we're in an extraordinarily strong position, given one, our spec count; and two, the margins built into our specs, so that even if we have to discount -- and we don't think that we're going to be eroding our overall gross margins significantly. Ordinary course of business. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : That's really helpful. Donald J. Tomnitz: Yes, when we're managing specs as ordinary course of business, the ones that really will receive more discounts are those that are aged. And that's what we really monitor very closely, to manage our specs. And our aged completed specs continue to stay at a very low level. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Great, that's very helpful. That's very interesting. And then secondly, regarding your land spend, you pointed out just now that it is really low. It's actually really the lowest we've seen for a while from you guys. Some people would take that as a sign of confidence that when you start feeling really good about the business, again, that you might actually start coming back into the market and spending more land -- more on land. But from your commentary, it sounds like you're pretty much planning on standing pat for at least the next few quarters -- or next couple of quarters in terms of land spend at this kind of level. Is that a fair characterization? Or are you guys thinking that the land market is starting to look more interesting here? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, it's always interesting. Has been for 30-some odd years, but I'd say that we're -- the key in the land side is to be proactive earlier in the market, just like we do on the acquisition side. So I would say to you, the wonderful thing about where we are today is we were proactive. We have some great subdivisions and masterplan communities that we're bringing in at lower than current prices, which gives us that pricing power. We're proactive in the market. We're always taking a look at opportunities. And I wouldn't describe our land acquisition policy as on the back burner. We're always out there aggressively looking for quality deals that we can make our return on. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Great, that's very helpful. And then lastly, the FHA changes, the loan lumps [ph] coming down and whatnot. And I was just in Florida last week. It was definitely a topic of conversation, but people haven't really been seeing the effect yet. With your commentary about the last week of January -- or the most recent week of January, it would sound like it's not really having much of a bite on your ability to transact. Can you just sort of comment on what you think the loan limit impact is going to be on your business? Stacey H. Dwyer: It's probably a smaller impact for us now than it would've been a few years ago, because we've already seen the mix of the mortgages that we're writing through our mortgage company come down significantly in the FHA category. I think part of that has been intentional, as they've raised the down payment for the last 3 years and then increased the insurance cost, both on the upfront and the monthly premium. So the cost of an FHA loan compared to an initial loan is getting to be in the same ballpark. So if people had the 5%, they're probably going to choose to put the 5% down. So I'm sure that there will be some places that are impacted, some buyers that are impacted, but there are good alternatives for them with the conventional financing that's available as well. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : This is Rob Hansen on for Nishu. Just kind of noticing over the past few quarters, your total land supply on an absolute basis and on a year supply basis has come down pretty significantly. So I just wanted to see if you could comment on what you think your kind of optimal land supply is here going forward? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, currently, we're sitting on approximately a 2.5-year supply of finished lots, both owned and option. And our total lot supply, both developed -- and our finished and unfinished is right at 5 years. So my definition of a conservative but more than adequate land supply is a 5-year supply. And we're right on that number right now. And 2.5-year supply of finished lots, that gives us more than enough lots to meet the demand and meet the construction cycles and so forth on the land development side. So we think we're well positioned. Those are good numbers, 2.5 and 5. Rob Hansen - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. And then kind of given the comments you've made on land prices and a little bit of a slowdown in land spend, I guess you're kind of right around where you need to be in terms of total land. But does this mean that acquisitions may be a better way to pick up land in the future, given your other comments? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, not to create a higher hurdle for Mike sitting over here to my left. But I guess it all depends upon the premium that he has to pay for lot positions. Mike Murray : Absolutely. It's one strategy to acquire a greater land position, but it's also -- acquisitions give you sometimes a functional capability you didn't have before, or gets you quicker to achieving efficiency in a given functional capability beyond just acquiring land or lots. Always looking at land and lot option positions. And while the spend did come down in the first quarter, as looking at a discrete 3-month window, those -- that's kind of a short window to look at. And it was very -- it was much higher in the prior quarter, a little bit lower in the quarter before that. So it is going to fall up and down as we see the opportunities and when various land transactions close. It's hard to look at any one 3-month period and extrapolate to that. Plus, our development spending has increased as we're bringing more of those land purchases from last fiscal year into production this year. Donald J. Tomnitz: The key in the land acquisition business is to be able to be opportunistic based upon your inventory of land and loss supply for your expected housing production. And we are right in the right place, right now in terms of where we bought and when we bought. And we're not -- we don't have to be desperate to go out and replace lots. We see land transactions taking place in several of the markets that I've been in recently, where it doesn't make any sense to us -- the prices that some of our competitors are paying for land prices. So again, we feel like that, that 2.5 and 5-year supply at the prices we have, and we can replace those as we see fit and as demand dictates, but we don't have to overreact on the land purchase side. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : I guess, Don, the question of seasonality, as we kind of look at the homebuilders right now, usually, since 1Q decelerates from 4Q it's not abnormal for 2Q to go up from 1Q. Our estimate is you guys usually go up around 50% sequentially. Is that somewhat accurate? Is that a reasonable benchmark for our and perhaps your expectations, if the season is doing well or not? Per absorptions, per community? Donald J. Tomnitz: I would answer that question, yes, really. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Okay. Now as we're seeing differences by region, so the southeast in terms of backlog, it had come down versus other places like -- southwest, excuse me, have come down versus the east. Could you just perhaps comment if these absorptions are different by the regions? Or why we're seeing such swings in those particular markets? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think in particular if you look at the southwest, basically, our ASPs out there are flat. And, essentially, the southwest for us is Phoenix and New Mexico -- or Arizona and New Mexico. So as a result, I just came out of Phoenix and Tucson. And if you look at Phoenix, specifically, this -- at this point in the year, they have about 25,000 or 26,000 existing homes on the market compared to 16,000 last year, so that's a lot of competition for all sellers. Secondly, that the ASPs in calendar year '13 in Phoenix increased 25%, and that's not expected to happen in fiscal year or calendar year '14. But as a result, I think that pricing ran up dramatically and quickly in Phoenix and has plateaued. And I think that it will stay flat to slightly decreased in Phoenix, and maybe to a certain extent in Tucson. But that's the wonderful thing about where DR Horton is and in our footprint, because we're well diversified. And we want to be a bigger builder in Phoenix, but right now is not the right time, given where the demand and the pricing point is. It's a good market for us, but it's not a great market. And it's going to be weaker, I think, in '14 than what it is -- was in '13. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : So you're asserting rising existing inventory is hurting the new supply demand? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think if you're a seller in the marketplace, and you have 26,000 homes on the market versus 16,000 homes, I think that notwithstanding the fact there's a percentage of the buyer out there who is a new homebuyer and not an existing homebuyer, that nevertheless that additional inventory in the marketplace creates a more competitive environment. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And do you see pressure from what had been investor-related properties coming back to the market? Or are they in just different locales? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think it's difficult to ascertain what the level of investor ownership is in each one of these markets. And I do believe that the investors are still holding. But as the ASPs flatten year-over-year, I think that'll create more opportunities for those -- or create more reason for those owners to bring those units to market. So you could face more increased competition especially in some of the Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas and so forth, where there has been a huge investor participation. I think there's a possibility those units will start coming back to market and compete with all sellers. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Joel Locker from FBN Securities. Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division : I just was curious on your tax rate. It was around 35%. What do you expect going forward in the rest of '14 and '15? Bill W. Wheat: For the remainder of '14, we would expect to be between 35% and 36% this year. The primary difference this year is that we're going to able -- we expect to be able to fully utilize the domestic production activities deduction, which has been limited for the last few years as we've been utilizing our NOL carryforward. We've now fully utilized our federal NOL carryforward, so now we'll get that deduction, which helps to offset our overall tax rate. So our expectation's between 35% and 36%. Joel Locker - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division : And what about 2015, is that going to be any different? Bill W. Wheat: Based on what we can see right now, I wouldn't guide to anything really different than that. There could be changes between now and then. But as of right now, I wouldn't see any significant difference from '14. Operator : Our next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Your average order price was up 10% year-over-year which is fantastic, but it was sequentially flat. And I wanted to get a view, with the opening ASP for orders of 275,000, what should we expect for modeling purposes? And how should we think about it moving forward through the rest of the year? Bill W. Wheat: In terms of -- we've seen very good average selling price increases throughout '13. We have stated previously that we -- while we do expect to see some further pricing power into '14 depending on the strength of the market, we don't expect the prices to continue to increase at the same rate. So as we sit here today seeing early results that points towards a strong spring, we would expect to continue to see some further pricing increases over our current levels, but perhaps not the same pace we saw last year. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Would mid-single digit for the full year be a good starting point for thinking about it? Bill W. Wheat: If you look at the course of history, if you have sales price increases in the mid-single digits, that's a very solid year, so we would certainly take that. We'd expect more, but accept that. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And great job on gross margin, huge move. It also sounds like it's sustainable, which is a great set up for 2014. Can you just give us a framework for thinking about operating margin on a net basis, how you see that moving through the year? Obviously, you have a tailwind with the gross margins, but what's the leverage look like on SG&A? And how much more upside should we be thinking this year in a good setup to the spring selling season, volumes good, pricing is strong so far? Should we be expecting big things out of operating margin performance? Bill W. Wheat: Well, certainly. As you well know, the whole year will be -- will really be determined by how strong the spring selling season is. So there certainly is some uncertainty about where it can go. But where we stand today with where our backlog margins are, with what we see in our communities across our operation, we feel good about our current margin levels. We feel like we should able to sustain them in the current range. And we certainly expect to continue to be able to leverage SG&A. We've got 20 basis points in the first quarter. We would expect to continue to get further leverage through the year and improve on our previous years' operating margin. Past that, it's really going to depend on the strength that we see in the marketplace as we get into the spring. Donald J. Tomnitz: A lot of that is a function of the fact that we've been steadfast and holding on to our margins though through the fourth quarter of fiscal year '13 and, clearly, the first quarter. And I will say, with the demand that we're experiencing in the first several weeks of January, I feel like with the limited inventory that's prevalent in the marketplace today, that we should be in a pricing power position -- strong pricing power position in most of our markets on a go-forward basis for fiscal year '14. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : You guys have commented traditionally gross margin's been between 20% and 22%. You obviously beat that this quarter. Is there any chance we're seeing a shift towards a higher gross margin range above that 20% to 22%, maybe like 21% to 23%? Donald J. Tomnitz: It depends upon a couple of factors. If we continue to do a good job of controlling our cost -- our stick-and-brick cost, as we have been doing relative to our sales prices, as well as, as I continue to say, everything that I read, everything that I see in the marketplaces. There's a limited supply of new homes on the marketplace. If the demand is as good as we think it's going to be in fiscal year '14 spring selling season, we will have an opportunity to expand those margins. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citi. William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : In regards to your financing business, with the implementation of the Ability to Pay rule, just about 20 days ago, can you talk about any added cost that we should expect, and how that may impact margins? And how have you seen that impact closings of those mortgages as well? Stacey H. Dwyer: So far, we've not seen any impact on the closing of the mortgages. We have added some level of overhead for additional staffing, because we have implemented additional review processes at different points during the originating process to make sure that we are complying with the new regulation. So the customer's ending up with essentially the same mortgage product, and we've added a few more costs to deliver that product. William Randow - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Thanks for that, Stacy. And then just a follow-up to an earlier question. Can you talk about the top 5 categories, where you're seeing incremental pressure on input costs? Sounds like land might be one of them but might be stabilizing. Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, first of all, it's not impacting our input cost simply because we are not having to buy land at those higher prices today. Clearly, we see a little bit of increase -- potential increase on the drywall side. And I don't know how much that's going to be. But we think it's going to be a low total dollar amount per home. Lumber prices right now have been working in our favor, clearly. The one thing that is pretty constant in our business is that the lumber companies know that we have a strong spring selling season; and typically, lumber prices will increase in the spring selling season as the demand increases. So I would anticipate lumber will do the same thing that it has historically done for some-30 on years I've been in the business. They'll continue to raise prices in the spring. Other than that, those are my reflections. I don't know if you guys have any additional thoughts. Stacey H. Dwyer: I'd just add labor to the bucket in selected markets just based on the construction level that we're seeing there and the availability of labor amongst the various trades, but that's not a consistent across the nation increase. Donald J. Tomnitz: But just as a point of order, if you take a look at our year-over-year stick-and-brick cost per square foot, they were up less than what our year-over-year increase in our revenue per square foot is. So we're continuing to be able to raise prices at a faster pace than what we are experiencing cost increases. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC: Strong results. Don, I wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of your enthusiasm for the spring selling season, because last year, spring selling season was pretty darn strong, mortgages were 3.5% or lower, prices were much lower than they are today. So, I guess, I'm just trying to understand, do you think we're going to be able to see higher sales than we did a year ago? Or can you help me out with that? Donald J. Tomnitz: We, personally, are counting on higher sales this year than a year ago. A couple of factors that I think are impacting that. One is that even though not overly excited about the growth in the economy, the one -- national economy, the one thing that is accurate is that there seems to be a slowing improvement in the overall economy, and that's good for our business. I think that translates into increased jobs, especially permanent jobs or full-time jobs, that will be additive to our business. Also, as I've mentioned earlier, there's been an adaptation to the current mortgage rates by the buyer over the last 4 or 5 years. And I think that's going to be -- or 4 or 5 months, I should say. And I think that's a positive to our business. And I also believe that when buyers are going into communities and looking for new homes, and there's not an excess inventory of new homes, I think that's a positive factor. One of the most negative things about a selling environment is if there's excess inventory in the subdivision, or in the market in particular, because then there's very little urgency on the part of the buyer. So I think the supply side is definitely helping the demand side, if no other reason from a psychological point of view is that there's not a lot of excess inventory out there. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC: Okay, that's helpful. The other thing that I was trying to, I guess, understand better was it seems like, obviously, your margins were better, and I think you guys noted that it was because incentives were lower than a year ago. But I would have thought it's the other way around, because it seems like the markets slowed down at the end of 2013 and many builders were increasing incentives, it seems, versus the previous years. So I thought margins would have been under a little bit of pressure. But it seemed like in your case, that wasn't the case. So how is it that you think incentives were lower this year than last year? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think, largely, as we said, Alex, from our fiscal year end '13 conference call is that we were not going to overreact. We looked at the inventory levels across the country and our markets, and we didn't see any excess inventory out there. And as a result, we -- and then especially places like the west, in particular, all the way from Seattle to Portland and northern California to Southern California, there's just not a lot of inventory out there, both in terms of finished lots nor finished homes. And we decided that we would not overreact, and that we would maximize our margins in that area. And if you take a look at the west in particular, our average sales price in the west was up 21%, and our operating margins increased from 9% to 15%. So I feel like that we called it perfectly out there, and we are in a strong position, like I said, in almost all of our markets, and we're going to let the market come to us. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC: Okay, that's great. And if I could ask one for Bill. Bill, can you help me on the interest amortized of cost of goods sold versus interest incurred? Are those going to reverse towards each other at some point later this year or not until next year, you think? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, I would expect that gap to narrow over the next year as we began capitalizing all of our interest costs, beginning in Q3 of last year once our active inventory exceeded our debt. The amount of inventory and interest in inventory has started to rise a bit, so I would expect that gap between interest incurred and amortized cost of sales to narrow a bit over time. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from MorningStar. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : What were the selling prices and cost per square foot in your closings and new orders? Bill W. Wheat: For closings, our revenue per square foot was $115 for the first quarter. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : How much is that up on a year-over-year basis? Bill W. Wheat: On a year-over-year basis, that was up... Donald J. Tomnitz: 8.4%. Bill W. Wheat: 8.4%. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : 8.4%. And then the cost per square foot? Stacey H. Dwyer: It was up about 8.2%. Donald J. Tomnitz: And that's just stick and brick. That's variable construction cost, yes. Stacey H. Dwyer: Yes, that's stick and brick, sorry. Right, yes. And we do that on homes closed because on homes sold, it's not final, final. Closings, we can actually measure that and know that's a final number. Donald J. Tomnitz: So as we said earlier, we're continuing to raise our prices faster than our costs are increasing. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : When do the higher underwritten land deals really starts to flow through the P&L? Donald J. Tomnitz: We anticipate third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year and then throughout fiscal year '15. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And final question, how much would you estimate you're getting in margin benefit just from previously impaired land? Donald J. Tomnitz: That's very little. That's been declining every quarter for the last 3 years, so it's pretty minimal now. Stacey H. Dwyer: The majority of our closings are on more recent land. Donald J. Tomnitz: Right, yes. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. One last question to throw in there. What's the latest activity with small private builders? Are you seeing them become a greater participant in the land market? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think the land market for most of the small builders is still a difficult proposition, simply because of the fact that banks are not lending, and a lot of those smaller builders are still reliant upon forming LLCs and finding private investors to finance it for them. And obviously, those are at higher interest rates than what you could get from a commercial bank, except that the commercial banks are not lending. So as a result, we still believe the public builder has a very advantageous opportunity, both on the land side, as well as the cost side and the houses. The smaller builders are not that significant a competitive environment for us, simply because of the fact -- the lack of financing. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : And you expect that to improve for them going forward in the next year or two? Donald J. Tomnitz: Oh, at some point in time, I presume the banks will begin lending, but I don't see that imminent on the marketplace. And one of the things that Mike is seeing on the acquisition side are smaller and medium-sized builders who are having difficulty acquiring financing and as a result are soliciting or interested in, I guess, liquidating their companies -- selling their companies. It's very competitive on the financing side out there for small people. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : I wanted to go back to the spec inventory that you guys have. And just -- could you help me characterize what kind of specs you're building at this point, whether your mix of specs is more entry-level focused or more of the move-up product that's going out the door? And to what extent your view of mortgage availability this year is influencing the product mix of specs that you're building right now? Donald J. Tomnitz: Our specs are across all subdivision, all product lines and all price lines. Clearly, from a volume perspective, we're going to have more of them on the entry-level and lesser in the move-up buyer, and even lesser into the second and third time buyer on our annual[ph] side. But clearly, we're, as Stacy said earlier, the heart and the core of D.R. Horton is still that first-time, and to the lesser extent, second-time homebuyer, but that's the vast majority of our focus. And that's where our specs are. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : And separate topic. Just going to the idea of investors in the markets. Have you been approached by any single-family rental operators that are out there, some of the larger guys or even smaller guys, that may want to buy new homes and build them for rent purposes? Is that something you guys would consider doing? Donald J. Tomnitz: We have not been approached to that on a large-scale. That happens from time to time. We're in the business of building, selling and closing single-family homes to individual homebuyers. We have avoided selling blocks of homes to investors. That's not our business, and that's not a business that we want to be in. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Tomnitz for any closing or further comments. Donald J. Tomnitz: Yes. Thank you very much. D.R. and I would like to thank all of our D.R. Horton employees. We've done a phenomenal job over the last 3 or 4 years. I can't say enough kudos to you. We continue to outperform our competitors. I've been here for 30 years. We've never been better positioned than we are today for the spring selling season in terms of opportunistic land purchases that we made, finished lot costs that we have in our land development deals as well as our inventory that's in the field. All of our salespeople are totally in a position of power, because you're well inventoried with specs in your communities. And we ask you to do the same thing that we've always asked you to do and that you' ve done : sell our specs and close them. And let's move onto a fantastic year. We're very optimistic about fiscal year '14. It's the culmination of a lot of hard work over the last 4 or 5 years. And it's time to slam dunk it. Thank you very much. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. D.R. Horton would like to thank you for participating today. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Don Tomnitz, President and CEO, D.R. Horton. Mr. Tomnitz, you may begin. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Joining me this morning are David Auld, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Murray, Senior Vice President of Business Development; and Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Communications. Before we get started, Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you, Jessica. The spring selling season is well underway. Our net sales orders in the March quarter were up 57% sequentially in the December quarter and at 9% from the second quarter of last year. Our average sales price increased by 10% year-over-year to $278,900, driving a 20% increase in the value of our net sales. Our solid sales performance resulted in an 18% increase in our backlog value compared to the prior year quarter, putting us in a strong position for increased revenue and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2014. Our team of operators across the country also delivered outstanding profitability this quarter, with $201.9 million of pretax income on $1.7 billion of revenues, resulting in a pretax operating margin of 11.6%. Housing market conditions remained favorable and continue to improve in a manner consistent with our long-stated expectations for the housing recovery. As expected, we are seeing the pace and the strength of the recovery vary significantly across our local operating markets, mostly tied to improvement in each markets economy is measured by growth in jobs, household incomes, household formations and increases in consumer confidence. D.R. Horton is well-known for operating homes for the first-time and first-time move-up buyer, with 56% of our homes closing at an average sales price of $250,000 or less this quarter. We are experiencing solid demand and profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton communities. Our high-end, Emerald brand continues to grow and is currently being offered in 27 markets across 10 states. This growth is evident as 6% of our homes closed this quarter were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue, up from 3% on homes closed and 9% on revenues in the same quarter the prior year. We believe that the true entry-level buyer is underserved in the current market, especially after the significant increases in home prices in the last 2 years. Therefore, we recently introduced a new brand, Express Homes, targeted at the true entry-level buyer that is focused first and foremost on affordability. Our rollout of Express is in the very early stages, just getting off the ground in 13 markets and 4 states. The price points of an Express Home will vary from market to market, but will consistently focus on providing an affordable entry-level home. We look forward to growing all 3 of our brands and product offerings to gain market share across all price points as the recovery continues. We are positioned to grow revenues at a double-digit pace with strong operating margins for generating increasing returns. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our consolidated pretax income increased 42% to $201.9 million in the second quarter from $142.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pretax income as a percentage of consolidated revenue was 11.6%, an increase of 170 basis points from 9.9% in the year-ago quarter. Homebuilding pretax income increased 50% to $191.7 million from $127.4 million, and financial services pretax income was $10.2 million compared to $14.7 million. Net income for the second quarter increased 18% to $131 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $111 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Mike? Michael Murray : Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 23% to $1.7 billion on 6,194 homes closed, up from $1.4 billion on 5,643 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $271,200, up 12% compared to the prior year, driven by pricing power and an increased mix of larger move-up homes. David? David V. Auld: The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 20% from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion. Homes closed -- homes sold increased 9% to 8,569 homes, on an 11% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price increased 10% to $278,900. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19%, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 18% from a year ago to $2.8 billion, with an average sales price per home of $280,700. And homes in backlog increased 5% to 10,059 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the quarter exceeded our expectations at 81%. We expect our third quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, consistent with our long-term average rate. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 22.5%, up 210 basis points from the year-ago quarter. 160 basis points of the margin increase was due to improved market conditions resulting in higher selling prices in excess of cost increases; 30 basis points was due to lower amortize interest in property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenue; and the remaining 20 basis points was due to lower relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims. Sequentially, our gross margin improved 20 basis points from the first quarter, primarily due to lower relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims, with little impact from market conditions. We expect that further improvements from this quarter's 22.5% in gross margin will be challenging. As long as market conditions remain stable, we expect to maintain strong gross margins generally in the range of our last 4 quarters, with quarterly fluctuations due to product and geographic mix. We are positioned to grow revenues at a double-digit pace with strong operating margins while generating increasing returns. We expect revenue growth to be a stronger driver of our earnings growth going forward rather than margin expansion. David? David V. Auld: Ongoing SG&A for the quarter was $187,900,000, or $187.9 million compared to $155.1 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 10 basis points to 11.1% from 11.2%. While we continue to build our sales and production capabilities where necessary, we expect to see modest improvement in our annual SG&A percentage as we continue to work to our target of 10%. For our third and fourth quarters this year, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to decrease sequentially on higher expected revenues. The improvement in our gross profit and SG&A percentages expanded our homebuilding pretax margin to 11.3% in the current quarter, an increase of 210 basis points from 9.2% in the year-ago quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income for the quarter was $10.2 million, compared to $14.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter continued to reflect the more competitive pricing environment, whereas the year-ago quarter benefited from unusually favorable market conditions which produced higher-than-normal gains on sale of mortgages. 90% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of our mortgage companies volume this quarter, down from 49% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 42% of the closings handled by mortgage company this quarter compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Mike? Michael Murray : Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by approximately $142 million since December. We had 17,600 homes in inventory at the end of March, of which 1,400 were models, 8,600 were speculative homes and 3,000 of the specs were completed. In our second fiscal quarter, our investments in lots, land and development totaled $560 million, of which $376 million was to purchase finished lots and land and $184 million was for land development. At March 31, 2014, we owned 125,000 lots and controlled another 47,000 lots through option contracts. 60,000 of our lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 27,000 are optioned. We are well-positioned to meet demand with our 172,000 total lots owned and controlled. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our unrestricted homebuilding cash totaled $930.8 million at quarter end. At March 31, we had available capacity on our revolving credit facility of $654.5 million and no cash borrowings outstanding. Our homebuilding leverage ratio, net of cash, was 38.4%, and our gross homebuilding leverage was 45.5%. The balance of our public notes outstanding in March 31 was $3.6 billion. Our $500 million principal amount of convertible notes mature on May 15. Holders of these notes may convert all or any portion of their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on May 13. For the notes they convert, we intend to settle them with common stock. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: In closing, this quarter, our pretax income increased 42% to $201.9 million. The majority of our operating metrics continue to improve on a year-over-year basis this quarter, highlighted by the value of our sales, closings and backlog, increased by 20%, 23% and 18%, respectively. Our net sales orders increased 57% sequentially on a 3% increase in average active selling communities. And our pretax operating margin increased 170 basis points to 11.6%. We are well-positioned to improve our profit and return metrics with our broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our 3 brands, an attractive finished lot position and a solid balance sheet. We continue to focus on our core D.R. Horton brand, as well as striving to become the leading luxury builder with our Emerald brand. We believe the next leg of this recovery will be driven by the true entry-level buyer, and we're prepared to capture that demand with our recently introduced Express brand. We like to personally thank all of our D.R. Horton team for another great quarter. D.R. and I request that you keep up with the good work and finish off the spring selling season strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now host any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg of UBS. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I wanted to ask, it feels like, in addition to the increased absorption pace, the better tone, it feels like you guys are differentiating your performance a little bit from some of your peers. And I was wondering if you could talk about, do you think that sales effort is it product, is it geography, is it a little bit of both? Maybe how you rank order what you think is causing some differentiation in terms of performance? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think it's a combination of all. But I think if you remember, we had and we still have the broadest geographic footprint on the industry. And during the downturn, we kept our footprint, we consolidated our divisions within our footprint in anticipation of a housing recovery, and we're now prepared to continue to expand those markets where we kept our footprint. So clearly, we're not dependent on any one market, and there are weak markets across the country, so we're able to supplement those weak markets with stronger markets in our footprint. So clearly, I think our geographic footprint is a key to our great performance. Bill W. Wheat: And as you know, David, we're always very focused on our execution and our operation of the business controlling our cost, and we're always focused on sales. So I think that's just been a hallmark, a consistent aspect of our approach to the business. David Goldberg - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Definitely. And then I just had a follow-up question on the Express brand and the rollout, is that going to be kind of done on a market-by-market basis, because it feels like the entry-level coming back, I agree that it's the next leg of the recovery, but it's been a little bit sporadic in terms of where we seen it. Do you see it kind of rolling out nationally, or do you see it kind of a market-by-market basis kind of a slow rollout? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, as you know, at Horton, we like to dip our toe in the water before we jump completely in. So clearly, we're going to roll out the Express brand on a market-by-market basis, focusing perhaps more on the affordable markets than the higher end markets. And we will roll it out on a national basis, but we're going to focus first and foremost on where we feel like we have the best chance of affordability. Operator : Our next question is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Previously, you talked a bit about having some plans put in place in case the spring didn't materialize the way you wanted it to. I was wondering if you could just talk about the quarter and what kind of parts of those plans you actually implemented, if any, and just kind of how the quarter progressed relative to your expectations when you last spoke to us? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, our sales improved on a month-to-month basis sequentially each month in the quarter. And as we mentioned in the last quarter's conference call, we expected to meet -- that there was challenge in demand in any of the markets. We indicated that we are more than well-prepared with our low-cost basis and our low construction cost to be able to increase incentives as necessary. We did increase incentives some within second quarter, primarily toward the end of the quarter, but not significantly. And we'll continue to do that because one thing that we're focused on is inventory turn hitting our absorptions in each one of our respective markets. Adam Rudiger - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then moving to your specs, previously, I think, there has been discussion about specs getting higher margins than dirt sales. I was wondering if that was still the case. And if -- how your -- back to David's questions about potential differentiation, how you thought your differentiated spec strategy relative to some peers might have been impacting your quarter? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, our spec strategy is still clearly at a very important part of our business. We're getting closer back to a more normal environment as pricing power is still there in some markets, but it's not across the board as much as it was. And so today, our spec margins are more in line with our dirt margins. And over time, we would expect that our build jobs will have slightly higher margins than our specs. Donald J. Tomnitz: And really, we've managed our specs very, very well over the years, as you know. We look at [ph] this account for over 60% of our sales. And they have one thing in common, they like to put a buyer on almost quickly as possible, and also collect the commission quickly as possible. So we're well-prepared to meet that realtor support and demand that we have across the country. But typically, if you look at our spec percentage, it went down from 55% to 49%, our completed specs declined and our sales -- our specs greater than 6 months were pretty much stable, so we're in a very strong position spec-wise. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : First question I had was on the incentives. And Don, I think you mentioned that you increased incentives and that was more oriented towards, I guess, the back half of your fiscal second quarter. So wanted to get a sense of how much incentive has increased, and what your approach is with respect to incentives on a go-forward basis? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, Mike, we've taken a very targeted approach to incentives. That's community by community. Each community has their sales absorption plans and they make sure that they are meeting the market, meeting the competition to hit those plans, so they need to add some incentives, they do. In general, we saw a very slight increase in our incentives over the quarter, but we really expected to see that. Some markets increased incentives, some did not. We're still seeing many markets where we're increasing prices and incentives are still very low. So it really is in line with our overall assessment of the market is that the market is improving very differently from market to market. In some markets will see incentives, and some we will not. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just suffice to say it was at the margin in terms of the amount of incentives that you increased in aggregate? Bill W. Wheat: For the quarter, it was a slight increase on the margin. And of course, that's coming off a very low incentive levels a year ago, abnormally low incentive levels a year ago. So really, we just view that we're coming back to a more normal level where community-by-community basis, some having incentives, some do not. Donald J. Tomnitz: And taken into consideration the increase in ASPs and the pricing power we've had over last couple of years, I think it's only natural that incentives begin to kick in some. Michael A. Roxland - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Got it. Appreciate that. And then my last question is, can you just provide some color around further operating leverage and the additional opportunities you have to drive that lower? Is that more of a function at this point of the double-digit increase in revenue that you're expecting? Or are there actually additional cost takeouts that you could pursue that would help drive that -- drive further operating leverage? Bill W. Wheat: So the primary driver would be increased volumes. As you well know, our long-term target on SG&A is 10%. We're working our way there, but we're not there yet. But as volumes increase, we would expect to get there. There's always places that we can continue to get more efficient throughout our company, we continue to focus on that. But we would believe that the larger driver of those efficiencies going forward would be volume increases. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Kenneth Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : As you guys are bringing this new product line on for first-time buyer, other builders have talked about their new product targeting this -- the new buyer being a lower margin but higher-turning product. Do you think it's kind of set to come out at the margins, that gross margins that you're now delivering? Donald J. Tomnitz: We think that, obviously, on that first-time mover -- first-time buyer market with margins are more challenging. We're budgeting as close as we can to our current margins, but probably slightly lower. But don't forget, we're planning on turning that product line as much as 3 times per year. So basically our return on that segment of the business will be just as good, if not better, than our normal business. In fact, it will be better. Bill W. Wheat: Yes, we will expect much higher absorptions in those communities, and so certainly in a high much higher absorption, you can take a slightly higher margin and you'll see as good or better returns in entry level community. Donald J. Tomnitz: Slightly lower margin. Bill W. Wheat: Slightly normal on returns. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : All right. I got that ratio. Now in terms... Bill W. Wheat: We like to have a higher margin and higher turn, but that would be a beautiful thing. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Right. So for your orders sequentially, you kind of -- you came in a little bit above, I think, your long-term seasonal rate of just a little above 50%, kind of flattens out generally in the third quarter. Is that what you're seeing now is one question. And second, you referred to community count being up 3% sequentially. Could you refer to it year-over-year, please? Donald J. Tomnitz: Our community count was up about 11% year-over-year, and I think we'd expect to see that community count continue to grow year-over-year, albeit at a slower pace than 11%, probably single digits -- high single digits for the balance of the year. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : And the seasonality of orders you're seeing so far? Jessica Hansen : Yes. So in terms of what we're seeing today, we're only 3 weeks into April, so we really don't have a whole lot to share, but we would expect our strongest sales quarters to be our fiscal second and third quarters of the year. So with our positioning, we would expect to have a strong Q3. Donald J. Tomnitz: Especially after having overcome the tough comp that we had in the second quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : First question, I wanted to ask about Emerald and Express and how to think about those longer-term in the context of your strategy. This recovery in downturn has been choppy. First, there was first-time buyer, then it's been entry-level -- I'm sorry, then it's been the move-up buyer. So should we think about Emerald and Express as kind of medium-term plays to -- that you might put more capital into depending on where we are in the cycle, or is this a longer-term shift to a more multi-brand strategy? Donald J. Tomnitz: So longer-term shift to a multi-brand strategy. We believe, from our perspective, that we have underserved that luxury buyer, and that was the reason we started focusing on the Emerald brand. It also helps us gain entry to some of the master-plan communities, where there are no or very few custom builders because of a lack of financing for those. And so we're able to backfill the space left by them because banks are still not lending to that small custom builder and provides us a great entry with a great capital position and a great balance sheet to become a major player on that higher end market, especially in master-plan communities. So we're focused on truly becoming the leading luxury builder with that brand over the next 3 to 4 years. On the Express side, there's no question that with the price increases that we've experienced in our industry over the last couple or 3 years with all the pricing power we have had, we've really depleted that pool of affordable buyers. And so as a result, by going down into the price range where we think we'll be in a typical market somewhere between 120 and 150 on the price point, but that truly is going to create for us a whole new pool of affordable buyers that let us expand our footprint and our revenues. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Got it. That makes a lot of sense at the lower end of the market, especially that comes back. But in a rising interest rate environment, affordability will be stretched and the amount that a dollar of mortgage payment buys will be stretched across all price segments. So are -- will there be, or are you planning to, or are you in the stages of implementing reactions to add across your D.R. Horton brand as well, or is that something more you're going to think about as interest rates rise? Donald J. Tomnitz: Clearly, as interest rates rise, I think that the Express brand is even going to put us in a stronger position, because as buyers have more difficulty qualifying, just as we saw 6, 9 months ago as the 30-year mortgage moved up, then we had higher cancellation rate during that time period and was primarily because of the fact that lack of affordability. So key, I think, to expanding our business on a go-forward basis in a rising interest rate environment is to be able to offer a lower-priced but competitive, well-built house. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Daniel Mark Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I was just wondering if you can talk a bit about Express in terms of just how different it's going to be from what you're doing currently in some markets. And then if we look at Mobile and some other places you're currently building at that price point, is it going to be -- so is some of it based on the success you've had there in terms of selling homes at that price point? Is it going to be continuing in terms of the -- just what something along those lines? How should we think about it overall in terms of just doing something different in terms of construction at a lower price point and such? Donald J. Tomnitz: Certainly, on the express side, we believe we're going to be able to turn that inventory a lot faster because the cycle time on the construction side of the business is going to be significantly less and we are focusing on that -- those cycle times on Express, but also across the other price points. But if you take a look at Express in general, we are going to be offering essentially a product that's not going to require options, not going to require upgrades. It's going to be basically a turn-key operation. When those people show up, they basically are going to be able to not have to go to the design center and purchase a lot of upgrades and options because they have difficulty qualifying, so basically, it's going to be pretty much a turn-key product. Daniel Mark Oppenheim - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Great, okay. Sounds like it will definitely meet a segment market that will work well there. And the second question, wondering, you talked about slight increase incentives at the end of the quarter, and how have you seen that in terms of as it's gone into April and how are you thinking about the environment here? Jessica Hansen : We're continuing to do what we would do on a day-to-day basis, which is meet the market on a community-by-community basis and do what we need to do to hit our targeted absorption. Donald J. Tomnitz: Dan, we're in an extraordinarily strong position, because as we've talked about on other conference calls, we've accumulated a very attractive land and lot position over the last couple of years. We're glad we're not on the market having to be aggressive on the land side today, because we've got built in gross margin in our existing land supply. So as a result, we assigned certain absorption level for each community, and we're going to move forward with our low cost structure, our land side and our construction side in order to meet our target. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : First question was on the Express brands, and I think it's a great idea and I do believe that the first-time buyer is definitely -- there are different reasons why I believe that buyer hasn't come back to the market. Certainly, affordability is at the top of the list, but I also think there is a lack of product out there as well, so I think it's a great idea. On that rollout, you said you typically kind of initially dip your toe in the water and go from there. Is -- how should we think about that in terms of timing? I mean, would 2014 be more of kind of the initial stages, and would we expect to see a more aggressive rollout in '15 if the expectations are met? And also from the land side, you mentioned a faster turn business. Is that going to be all kind of finished lot option take downs, are there going to be any land banking perhaps? Or would any of this be developed through your own development machine? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, clearly, on the Express side, we have our targets. And 2015, it will be a much greater growth rate than what it is in 2014. I can tell you that D.R. has given us guidance in terms of where he wants to be with Express in 2015, and our goal is to hit this aggressive targets. On the land side, we're focusing right now on finished lot deals. And in terms of having to develop land for Express, we may very well have to do that. But I will remind you of our strict underlying guidelines, and we're adhering to those as we move forward even into Express. And that is our goal is when we buy piece of land, that we get our initial land expense back within 24 months, and Express will adhere to those guidelines. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Great. On the gross margins, appreciate the color there, and I believe what was stated earlier on the call was that further improvement will be more difficult and that you'd expect gross margins to be in the range in the last 4 quarters or so. That would seem to imply that the number that you did in this most recent quarter being at the high end of that range, are you kind of saying in a way that there's a little bit of expectations for the back half of the year to be lower than the first half of the year, albeit modestly? Donald J. Tomnitz: I don't -- go ahead. Bill W. Wheat: No, no, we're not really saying that we expect margins to go down. What we're saying is we expect any further significant increases to be challenging. We really don't expect significant increases or really any significant decreases in margins, but we feel like they'll operate in a range similar to where we've been the last few quarters, including this quarter. Obviously, there is a number of -- there are number of factors that could push margins up or compress margins on an individual quarter. We expect some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But in general, we expect to stay in the same range we are right now. Donald J. Tomnitz: Mike, we've had tremendous, as you know, pricing power over the last couple of years, and that's one of the things I think that's depleting the pool of buyers out there. So clearly, with our Express brand, we're going to try to increase that pool. But yet, at the same time, we don't see major pricing power opportunities in as many markets as what we've had in the last 2 years. Bill W. Wheat: We are focused first and foremost on returns. We have achieved a lot of pricing power, a lot of operating margin, improvement over the last couple of years. Now we're focusing on maintaining that, improving our volumes to drive stronger returns. So continuing to increase to strengthen our returns versus where we've been. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And then just one last quick one, SG&A, down 10 bps year-over-year, I think in the first quarter it was down 30. Should we expect a similar type of kind of just modest year-over-year improvement? I know longer term, you're still trying to go for the 10%. But in terms of the back half, should we kind of expect a similar type of 10, 20 bp improvement? Donald J. Tomnitz: Clearly, with most of -- with approximately 60% of our annual closing is coming in the second half of the year, we are anticipating stronger SG&A performance in terms of decreasing our SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second half of the year. So we would not be happy with a 20 bp decrease. Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : No, I'm referring to year-over-year. So I certainly would expect it to be materially lower back half versus first half, but just as you look at on a year-over-year basis. Donald J. Tomnitz: With our expectation that it would decrease by even more in the second half than you would infer for the year, it will also decrease by even more than the 20 basis points we've been showing. Operator : Is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : I just wanted to ask about DT's comments regarding the first-time home buyer potentially returning. We've heard from a lot of people, Texas is strong and benefiting from sustained investment in oil and gas. What's your kind of expectation for other geographies that don't have that tailwind? And what do you think the timing is for something like that where we see this category open up? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, clearly, I think if we gain job growth in this country, which I think ultimately, we're going to experience and I think, clearly, that's where a lot of those first-time home buyers are going to come from. But I also believe strongly that as we move into this recovery, first-time home buyer is not participating at the level that a lot of our political leaders would like for them to be participating. And I think that they will see some encouragement from the government in terms of trying to get more and more people into entry level homes. So my focus is really the affordable buyer, job creation, as well as a little help in the politics. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Got it. So you need some things to come together for that to work out in the relative near term. Bill W. Wheat: I think that was a take-away close there. Donald J. Tomnitz: I'm supposed to do the take-away close. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Go ahead. Tell me. Donald J. Tomnitz: I'm supposed to do the take-away close. We wouldn't be getting into the Express brand, if we didn't feel like that, that was the next segment of the business to recover. And clearly, I do see more favorable job growth, and I think a lot of that job growth is more on entry-level jobs and that's going to translate into entry-level buyers. So improved job growth in the country, as well as I think that we start looking at the underwriting guidelines and moving forward to try to get more people qualified, I think that we're going to get some help on the qualification side. And I think you're seeing that with several lenders today. Robert C. Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Got it. Very helpful. Switching gears a little bit. Average order price on new homes in the quarter was up 10% against a very tough comp from last year. Do think you can sustain that kind of price appreciation during the balance of the year? How should we think about that? Should it tail off in the second half? Or do you think kind of a mid-single-digit full year price increase is achievable? Bill W. Wheat: It's hard to make it a call quarter-to-quarters. But in a specific discrete time because of mix changes and things like that. But we said consistently that we do expect -- we still expect further price increases, but we expect it to moderate down into the single-digits. Whether that will occur in Q3 or Q4 or sometime in fiscal '15, we can't tell you. But we do expect it to moderate back to the single-digits. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I know you haven't talked about Express at all this call. But I will ask you a couple of questions on the first-time buyer. I mean, in our field research, we're definitely seeing a comeback and we're seeing some of that credit availability that you just mentioned. Are you seeing a meaningful change? Your sales to first-time buyers were down year-over-year. But have you already reached the inflection point? And is that turning as far as you all are seeing in traffic, in demand, et cetera? And are you starting to see that drive to qualify type of activity going on? Donald J. Tomnitz: I think the biggest thing that we're seeing is the lack of affordable buyers out there. And as we increased our prices, new pricing power over the last couple of years, as I say, we depleted that pool of the first-time homebuyer. And our goal is to have a more competitively priced product with Express. And as I said, we are focusing on, in a typical affordable market, somewhere between $120,000 and $150,000 as an average sales price. So we have not had product offerings in that price point. So I think it's more of us trying to bring those people into the market as opposed to those people being out there and being underserved and driving to qualify. I just think it's a function of there's just not the product out there for those people to qualify. And if we can get that product price point down, then I believe there are people out there who truly will buy just simply because they've been priced out of the market. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And are you having to -- for the Express product, are you able to utilize some of that land that you already got on your books? Or is this primarily going to be new purchase-type of land base? Bill W. Wheat: It will be both, Stephen. There are some properties we have that we can bring out. And it will be a good fit for Express. But then there's also finished lots out there in areas that have been underserved that because there hasn't been anybody out there building this kind of product that are available to us as well. So we will look at all sources. But yes, it will help us a little bit on our land held piece, too. Stephen F. East - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And just quickly one last question to follow on what Bob was asking about, other regions. I mean, this definitely -- your performance this quarter turn from Texas to a lot of other regions at least from the order perspective. And we haven't necessarily seen that from all the other builders. What do you all think is going on in your markets that's allowed you to start to see that meaningful improvement? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think clearly if you take a look at our West. Our West had better sales and better closings. And that's a function of us over the last year and 2 years, taking good land positions in California and just now bringing those to fruition with model grand openings. So I think that clearly helped a lot. If you look at the East, the East performed well for us. And that's because David Auld was the previous regional president for the East. And the only reason he's sitting across on this conference call table is because of his performance in the East. But we entered into a lot of rolling option and a lot of good land deals in the East during his tenure. And they were penetrating those markets deeper. And we expect to continue to do that. The South, on the other hand, it's been strong all during the downturn, and it continues to be strong. But it's being -- to our credit, the South is being outpaced, as we always said, by the East and the West. And we said that will be a great position for this company to be in because the South region held us up and supported us during the downturn. And as Rick Horton said, the best thing that could ever happen to him is for the East and West to take the pressure off of him. So they are doing that today. And we're in a great position. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just wanted to just mention that I totally agree with your strategy to go after the entry level. I mean, as I recalled last month, I think this is really where the puck is going. And I really congratulate you guys on really being unique and sort of skating to where the puck is going, so good job with that. And I'm looking forward to learning a little bit more about the timing of how you roll out Express. I know there was already a question asked on it. I wanted to sort of roll something -- run something by you though. When we look at the job growth figures that have been coming across, generally speaking, the numbers in raw units or raw numbers of jobs have actually been pretty good for a while, and yet household information has been very depressed. We have our view on why you haven't seen that translate into household information. I'm curious as to what you are seeing in your markets. Are you hearing that your entry -- that the entry-level buyers, who are coming out, are saying to you, \"It's been really tough to get to this point where we can actually buy a home because we haven't been able to -- it took us a lot to get jobs?\" Or are you hearing that it's the type of jobs that they have been having that have required them to take longer to accrue the savings to buy the homes? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think most of the jobs being created in this country, Steve, are entry-level jobs. And as a result, just by definition, I think they're having to save a lot longer. I think the other thing that I was talking about earlier, the help from the political side, is with the high student loan debt that these people get, these college kids are graduating, young adults are graduating. And there's work on the political side that would help relieve them of some of that burden with the college debt. So as a result, even though they are graduating from college, many of them have had difficulty finding higher-paying jobs. And secondly, they're burdened with typically $26,000 with the student debt. So a function of getting them that entry-level job, which is pretty much a lot of them having to go into at perhaps a lower salary than what they expected, and some relief on the student loan debt, I think, that pool begins to grow. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : We've looked into the student loan issue. And what we've seen mostly has been an initiative in Washington to sort of prevent predatory servicing, I guess, you could say, but not necessarily in terms of forbearance or forgiveness so much. Have you been hearing something more specific to forbearance or forgiveness of current outstanding student loan balances? Donald J. Tomnitz: As I'd like to say, I watch too much Fox News. But on Fox Business News yesterday, there was a discussion on that. And I just caught the headline as I was walking by the conference room. So I don't know specifically about that, but there was a discussion yesterday on that in terms of how they can work with the people who have the college debt. I don't know whether that's forgiveness, forbearance or whatever. But I think you're going to have some relief. Bill W. Wheat: I think that there's recognition that it's an issue and it is holding back economic growth, I think there's a general sentiment that there will be some improvement or help along the way. Donald J. Tomnitz: We're helping everyone else, we might as well help the college students. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes. Well, that actually would have to be very encouraging. Your land spend figures that you gave this quarter suggest that you spend about 22% of your revs on land spend. It's about the lowest we've seen since the downturn. I was curious as to whether you anticipate maintaining this very strict control on land spend for the rest of the year, and in particular, whether it is -- you would expect to spend maybe a little more on land suitable for your Express or if you think you really got enough there, just like you do in the rest of your business. Michael Murray : I think we made a lot of early investments in the cycle that have allowed us to be very selective at this point and focus, as Bill said before, on the returns. So I think we're seeing some -- a lot of replacement of lot costs that's coming through. Bringing some of our land held back into production will help support some further growth. But I don't see a huge expansion, Stephen, in the push on land at this point. I think we're going to stay pretty focused and disciplined at this point moving forward. The Express model, we're going to prefer the finished lot deals, as DT said, but where necessary, make disciplined investments on projects that meet our return hurdles. Bill W. Wheat: That owned and controlled position of 170,000 lots, that will support much higher revenues than what we're generating today. So we believe that we can increase our revenues on the lot supply we have. And then if we need to augment it -- so at some point down the line, we will. But today, we feel like we're in good position. Donald J. Tomnitz: We are clearly focused on one thing on the land side, I assure you. And that is how do we get our initial investment on our land back within a 24-month period. And that's going to apply to all 3 brands. Bill W. Wheat: But even just to replenish our lot supply, there's still a significant spend. They're still on pace of a $2 billion year in terms of land act and land development, just to replenish and keep our lot supply where it is. And so this is not that we're not investing, we're just not necessarily growing our investment from the current level right now. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes. Well, I remember about a year ago, you made this comment, DT, that you wanted to limit your land spend to things that you could get your money back in, in 24 months. And I hand it to you, that was good timing because that was at a time when the market was feeling really ebullient. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG Capital. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to just get your take on Texas specifically, obviously your home market, knocking on almost 40 years there. It seems like a lot of the competition has been carving out Texas commentary this quarter, job growth, taxation, whether it maybe reading a lot about population addition numbers pretty encouraging. Are you seeing more builders come in? Is it more competitive than it was maybe a year or 2 ago? Are there more builders? Is your lot supply adequate there? Is land pricing disproportionately rising in Texas versus other markets? Just some color you can give us on the state overall. Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, obviously, D.R. started in Texas in 1978. And I will tell you, you can go to almost any community and turn the corner, and there are multiple builder signs on every corner, 20 to 30. So Texas is one of the most competitive markets, but it also has few barriers to entry. And that's one of the things that makes it so attractive, and that is that land prices are still competitively priced, so we can deliver a competitive lot. And there's ease of entry in terms of not having to go through, as we do in a number of markets, a 2- to 3-year entitlement period. Most of our land, we can get entitled and plotted within a period of 6 months or less. And there are adequate general contractors to develop lots down here. So in general, we think Texas has been a strong market. It's a very competitive market. We continue to lead every market in Texas. One of the things we're most proud of recently is that we're on our way to being #1 in the Houston market. We've been in the Dallas/Fort Worth market #1. And we're focusing on San Antonio and Austin. And I'll tell you that all of those markets are very, very strong for us and we're very competitive in those markets. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : So it sounds like it's always -- it's sort of a status quo, I mean, always been a good housing market and it doesn't [indiscernible] the others... Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think it's a good housing market because of the strong economy and as well as it's a great place to live with the people coming in and being able to buy a nice house that's affordable. And land prices are competitive. So there's no income tax in the state of Texas, so there are a lot of attractive reasons and the weather is great here. So I don't know why. There aren't many states that are as centrally-located with as many attributes as the state of Texas has. I mean, we've been a leader in Texas, and we'll continue to be the leader in Texas as we move forward. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division : Okay. And then just, I mean, how do you think about Emerald in terms of size and mix? I know it's a tough thing to answer with numerator, denominator mix and that sort of thing moving around. But how big could Emerald be? I know you rattled off some numbers early on. I missed some of those. But I think you said 6%, I believe. I mean, how do think that number could play out over time? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think we said it all when we said we are focusing on being the leading luxury builder in the U.S. And we anticipate that, that's a good growth segment for us and very profitable growth segment for us. But we're expanding it where it makes sense. And just like we said on the Express side, we started slow, dipping our toe in the water. And we found a great success in that market, great demand for our product out there. And the product line that we're offering is extraordinary in terms of finish out and quality of homes. So we expect Emerald to continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And as I said, our focus is how do we become the leading luxury builder in the U.S. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : I wanted to ask if you could clarify your comments on backlog conversion and how you would expect that to trend in the balance of the year. Do you think 4Q levels could reach what was achieved this quarter? And longer term, do you think normal backlog conversion should be below 70% or something in the 70% to 75% range normal? Jessica Hansen : Yes. There definitely is seasonality, Jade, to our backlog conversion rate. As we said earlier, we'd expect it to be around 75% in our third quarter, which really is our historical average at this point, if you look over the last 10 years. And then traditionally, our fourth quarter would be a higher backlog conversion rate than our third quarter. With as many homes that we sell and close in the same quarter, it's hard for us to give you guidance much further out than the next quarter. But yes, I think we'd expect our backlog conversion rate to increase somewhat in the fourth quarter from whatever we end up doing in the third quarter. Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then as far as a normal conversion rate, do you think something in the 70% to 75% range is a normalized level? Jessica Hansen : I think in the back half of the year, yes. And in the first half of the year, seasonally, it's usually a little bit lighter. Donald J. Tomnitz: And we thought it was abnormal that we had an 80% backlog conversion in the second quarter. But usually, second quarter is slower or lower backlog conversion than the first quarter. So I guess, our builders out there just decided to close a lot more homes in the second quarter than we anticipated. Jade J. Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division : Great. On financial services, the operating margin increased sequentially, which accounted to some of the mortgage banking trends we have been seeing. Do you expect the margin to moderate in coming quarters? Or do you think the current level has absorbed most of the competitive pressures? Bill W. Wheat: We think we've absorbed most of it, thus far. Obviously, we don't -- we can't tell what the future holds. But we certainly are encouraged when our volume is going up. And typically, in the quarters, when we have higher volume in our financial services segment, we'll see a better operating margin. And so Q3 and Q4 typically will show a better margin than we do in Q1 and Q2. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : First question on Express. Is the initial crop of neighborhoods there going to be repurposed D.R. Horton neighborhoods? Or is that something you might be pulling out of mothball? If you could just talk about that. Donald J. Tomnitz: I think it's a combination of both with a lot of them are new option lot deals that we entered into. And typically, it's in a market clearly where we've already been building the D.R. Horton brand and we're trying to increase our affordable buyer pool in that market because we have seen people coming into our model homes in the D.R. Horton brand, who can't qualify because of the pricing power that we had over the last couple of years. So primarily, it's expanding and supplementing our existing markets. James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then I was going to ask if we could dig in to the financing questions because while I would guess you're waiting on Washington to decide it wants to get back into the entry-level housing market, have you been hearing from bankers that they're willing to buy higher FICO paper -- excuse me, lower FICO paper, a little bit more risky paper on the average Express buyer even with mortgage rates sitting where they are now? Donald J. Tomnitz: Actually, we've heard the same thing you've heard on the media over the course over the last 60 to 90 days. We, from our mortgage company perspective, don't see a lot of institutions willing to buy that kind of paper. So as a result, it's limited from that perspective. James McCanless - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division : Okay. And if I could sneak one more in. When you were talking about the luxury builders, private luxury builders not getting a lot of financing from the banks, could you -- what are you seeing on the land development side? Are the banks willing to do development lending now? Or is that still a very small or closed business? Donald J. Tomnitz: Very, very limited. And thank goodness for our strong balance sheet because, frankly, as we've worked through that supply of finished lots that were generated in '07, '08 and '09, we've had to begin developing obviously. It takes a strong balance sheet to be able to do that. Clearly, that small builder, small developer, not back in the business because of lack of capital. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from Morningstar. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : To what extent did weather push out closings, negatively impact orders or lead to incremental cost in the quarter? It appears that there wasn't much effect in the closing side. Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, we have a policy at D.R. Horton. And it's a sincere policy. And that is we don't want our division presidents to give us a weather report. And so we're not really -- we work with our broad geographic footprint to the extent that we did have weather-related issues is really a nonevent. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And what were the cost ASPs per square foot in your closings this quarter? Bill W. Wheat: On a year-over-year basis, our revenues per square foot were up 9%. We usually talk about our vertical costs, our vertical's stick and brick costs during the quarter on a per square basis were up 10%. So essentially, our costs and our revenues increased at about the same rate on a per square foot basis. Now in aggregate per unit, revenue still exceeded our cost increases. James Krapfel - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then on the cost side, where do you see that trending going forward? You said you see some moderation in that inflation. Donald J. Tomnitz: I think costs are going to continue to increase. We are fortunate that we have a lot of volume in most of our markets so that we can be more competitive with our subcontractors on the cost side. But clearly, labor is one of the cost components that's going up. And lumber, I don't think is going to come down nearly as much as what it did last year. It seems like it's going to hang high at where it is currently right now. But it's a day-to-day process for our purchasing managers to work with our vendors and our suppliers and our trades out there to get the benefit of the volume that we can offer our vendors and our trades. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC: I wanted to ask on the Express homes. Are you guys going about your marketing strategy in a different way, meaning are you trying to target those entry level -- those renters more directly? Or are you kind of going the traditional way of just kind of waiting for them to show up at the communities? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I think it's a different type of marketing. I know that as you clearly are trying to attract the entry-level buyer, a lot of them living in apartments. And so we try to do a special marketing with the apartment complexes that are near us. And another potential pool are the people living with their -- the college graduates and others that are living with their parents. And I think we do that primarily through realtors. I also believe that our Express brand, that it's going to be easier for perhaps parents to help their children get into homes because they could help them a lot easier with a lower price point, as we have, with the Express brand than they can in a standard price that's with D.R. Horton. So I look at both those avenues as trying to get with the realtors to make sure that the parents or the kids who are living at home, we can attract them with a lower price point as well as focusing on those apartments. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center, LLC: And also wondering if you guys have considered doing a stock buyback, given how cheap your stock is this year? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, we don't -- I don't really want to comment on the stock buyback. I do know one thing on our business that's pretty general. And that is our focus is how do we get to a free cash flow position. And I think, Alex, if we adhere to our business plan that David is helping us implement, I think that we'll clearly get to a free cash flow position. And when we get to a free cash flow position, we're going to be in a position to do a lot of things. And one of them will be perhaps buying back our stock. But the key is how do we get to that free cash flow. Operator : We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management at this time. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you. And thank you for joining this call. D.R. and I and David want to thank everybody in the field because we had one heck of a quarter, as you know, and we turned in a sterling performance in the month of March, and we appreciate that. The key is how do we go forward, execute the business plan in Q3 and Q4 and deliver a very, very outstanding year for us in 2014. We're welcomed to have David onboard. He's a good addition to the 38th floor up here. And we've got a great team of people here as well as in the field. So thank you very much. And as I say, execute the competition and don't take any prisoners. Operator : Thank you. That does concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Horton America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United states, Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Don Tomnitz, President and CEO of D. R. Horton. Thank you, Mr. Tomnitz. You may begin. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you, Kevin. Thank you and good morning. Joining me this morning are David Auld, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Murray, Senior Vice President of Business Development; and Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Communications. Before we get started, Jessica? Jessica Hansen :  Some comments made on this call may constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: This brings demand for new homes remain relatively stable, compared to last year across the most of our markets. and the D.R Horton team leveraged our platform as the largest and most geographically diverse homebuilders to generate a 25% year-over-year increase in our third quarter net sales orders. Our increased community count, and inventories of lands, lots and homes put us in a strong competitive position. and our teams in the field have secured our business plan superbly, this quarter by focusing on achieving their targeted sales absorptions in each community every week. D.R Horton has been the leader in the U.S homebuilding industry for 12 consecutive years. Our market share position today is the largest in our history, with 40% more homes closed than any other builder in the most recently reported 12-month period. To diversify and strengthen our market share, both nationally and at the local level. we\u2019re actively extending product offerings across all price points throughout D.R. Horton, Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. The rollouts of our entry-level Express brand and our move-up on luxury Emerald brand are going well. And we will discuss our progress on both later in the call. Our homebuilding and financial services operations generated another solid quarter of profitable with $22.65 \u2013 with $226.5 million, excuse me, say that one more time, with $226.5 million of operating income and a 10.6% operating margin excluding impairment charges. With our 11,365 homes in backlog and the year-over-year improvement, we have seen in our sales during the first part of July, we expect strong home closings, revenues and profits in our fourth fiscal quarter ending September. All our efforts are part of our comprehensive return focus strategy, which we will explain in more detail throughout the call. Our primary strategic goal is to leverage our strong competitive position to generate growth, and revenues, and profits at a double-digit pace, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns on invested capital. Some of the operating actions we are taking to execute our return focus strategy resulted in some volatility on our financial metrics this quarter. However, we believe our consistent focus on increasing our returns and cash flows were still growing our revenues and profits will greatly benefit our company, and most importantly, our shareholders over the next two years. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Net income for the third quarter was $113.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to $146 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $171.8 million in the third quarter, compared to $205.1 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pretax income was $158.6 million, compared to $185.4 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in our pretax income this quarter was caused by $54.7 million of inventory impairment charges, primarily in our Chicago market where we are taking actions to reduce inventories to enable us to redeploy the capital to generate better returns. We will discuss these actions later in the call. Our third quarter, home sales revenues increased 28% to $2.1 billion on 7,676 homes closed, up from $1.6 billion on 6,464 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $272,300, up 8% compared to the prior year, largely driven by increases in average selling prices in our Southeast and West regions. David? David V. Auld:  The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 32% from the year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion. Homes sold increased 25% to 8,551 homes on 11% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price increased 5% to $281,300, the cancellation for the third \u2013 cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24%, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 26% from a year ago to $3.3 billion, with an average sales price of $286,200, and homes in backlog increased 15% to 11,365 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 74%, excluding closings from Crown Communities, subsequent to the acquisition date. We expect our fourth quarter backlog conversion rate to be around 75%, consistent with our long-term average for the fourth quarter. A key part of our return focus strategy is to consistently achieve our targeted sales absorptions in each community. Community absorption targets vary depending on location, product type, lot supply and market conditions at a local level. Our operators proactively adjust product offerings, sales prices and incentives to meet the market effectively compete from new home demand, with a goal of improving inventory turn and optimizing return on our investments. The best way to maximize returns and profits over the life of our communities is to sell and close at a consistent and plan phase. As the spring unfolded, we adjusted an increase to level of incentives in many communities, which helped generate our strong sales result. Overall, incentive levels were extremely low levels in fiscal 2013 and early 2014, but are now returning to normal levels in many markets with significant variations across our communities. Mike? Michael Murray :  In early May, we acquired the home building operations of Crown Communities for approximately $210 million in cash; Crown operates in Georgia, South Carolina and Eastern Alabama. we acquired approximately 640 homes in inventory, 2,350 lots and control of an additional 3,400 lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 431 homes valued at $113.6 million. All of the assets acquired were recorded at their estimated fair values and $53.6 million of goodwill was recorded as a result of the purchase. Our home sales gross profit this quarter was reduced by $9 million of purchase accounting related to the acquisition and we expect additional purchase accounting impact of $9 million on home sales gross profit over the next three quarters. Our third quarter results include 290 net sales and 254 closings from the Crown operations. And Crown increased our average active selling communities by 4% for the quarter. The Crown team operates an efficient business with very strong returns and we are pleased to have them on the D.R. Horton team. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : We continue to experience strong growth and profitability in the heart of our business our D.R. Horton branded communities which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closing this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands as we expand our product offerings to diversify and strengthen our market position both nationally and at a local level. This year we introduced our Express Homes brand which is targeted as the true entry-level buyer who is focused first and foremost on affordability. A segment we believe is currently underserved. In October we acquired Regent Homes an entry level builder on the Carolinas as we began to refocus on that segment of the market. Today and going forward we include Regent in our reported metrics for Express. We are now offering Express in 22 markets and eight states with a significant majority of our sales and closings to date coming from Texas the Carolinas. Even though we are still in an early stages of the roll out Express accounted for 7% of our homes sold, 4% of our home\u2019s closed and 2% of homes sales revenue in the third quarter. The Average closing price for an Express Homes this quarter was $156,000. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive. In 2012 under the D.R. Horton brand we began adding more communities and floor plans targeted toward move out buyers. Last year we introduced Emerald Homes as our brand for the higher end move up and luxury communities, 6% of homes closed this quarter were greater than $500,000 under both the Horton an Emerald brands accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue up from 3% in homes closed and 9% revenues in the same quarter of last year. We are now offering Emerald in 32 markets across the 11 states. Homes market in under our Emerald homes brand accounted for 2% of our homes sold and closed and 4% of our home sales revenue in the third quarter. The average closing price for an Emerald home this quarter was $655,000 consistent with our return focused strategy our expectation for all three of our brands is at 20% minimum annual return on inventory defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory. And our underwriting criteria for all land and lot purchases reflects this ROI expectation. In general we expect our Emerald communities to generate higher than average gross margin at slower than average absorptions. Our Express communities to generate faster than average absorption at lower than average gross margin and our Horton communities to continue to operate around our average margin and absorption. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: At the significant improvement in our gross margins over the last several quarters, we expected further improvement in our margins to be challenging and we expected revenue growth to become the strongest driver of our profit growth. Our expectation will realize this quarter as home price appreciation is moderating, some costs were still rising and incentives are increasing back to normal levels. At the same time we are focused on improving our returns on our inventory investments in each community at balancing our home prices incentives sales pace and profit margins. Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.7 % down 70 basis point from the year ago quarter, 60 basis points of the margin decrease was caused by higher relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue. Due to a large amount of costs reimbursements received in the prior year quarter. 40 basis points of decrease related to purchase accounting impact from the acquisitions of Crown Communities and Regent Homes. These decreases were partially offset by 20 basis points from year-over-year increases in sales prices and by 10 basis point due to lower amortized interest and property taxes costs as a percentage of home sales revenue compared to the prior year quarter. Sequentially, our home sales gross margin decreased 180 basis points from the second quarter, 90 basis points of the sequential margin decrease was due to the combined effect of higher levels of incentives and cost increases. As we mentioned earlier we adjusted and increased the level of incentives in many communities throughout the spring in an effort to improve sales absorptions and maximize returns and profits. In general incentives were at extremely low levels in fiscal 2013 and early 2014 and are now returning to more levels. An additional 60 basis points of the sequential margin decrease was due to higher relative costs for warranty and construction defect claims, and the remaining 30 basis points related to the purchase accounting impact from the Crown acquisition. Generally in a stable housing environment we expect our average gross margins to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and construction defects and interest costs. Mike? Mike Murray : Another important aspect of our return focused strategy is actively managing inactive or underperforming assets to improve returns and cash flows. And redeploying the cash in the more productive assets as market conditions have improved we are activating development of many of our mothballed assets and we\u2019ll begin selling and closing homes in these new communities over the next year. As a result our balance of land held for development declined over $100 million to $396 million at June 30 which corresponds to a 22% decrease in the number of lots to 17,000 lots from year ago our operators continue to develop their plans for each remaining held land parcel and we expect that land held for development will significantly decline over the upcoming year. Our third quarter results included $54.7 million of inventory impairment charges $48.8 million of the charges occurred in our mid west region primarily related to large land positions and actively selling communities in Chicago acquired between 2004 and 2007 that had been previously impaired in contrast to most of our markets the Chicago housing markets remains very weak with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing a lower expectations relative to the size of our investments. In response during the quarter we reduced prices and identified land parcels we intend to sell in these communities in an effort to increase sales pace reduced inventories and improved cash flows and returns. Based on current market conditions we believe that we do not have another concentration of underperforming communities in an individual market that would result in impairment charges of the same magnitude as we incurred in Chicago this quarter. However as we execute our return focus strategy and take actions to optimize cash returns by modifying our product, pricing, incentives or plans to sell land in individual active communities and land held for development we could incur additional impairment charges in the future. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $221.9 million compared to $167.5 million in the prior year quarter as a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A was 10.8% this quarter compared to 10.2% in the prior year quarter. Fiscal year to date SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues was 10.9% flat with last year. We are actively investing an SG&A infrastructure to support our current and expected growth. Additionally the third quarter SG&A percentage included a 20 basis point impact due to the increased valuation and compensation accruals, which increased because of our higher stock prices this quarter. And to correct myself our SG&A expense for the quarter was 10.6%. We expect SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues to decrease sequentially on fourth quarter on higher expected revenues. Beyond fiscal 2014 our ongoing annual target for SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues is 10%. Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income for the quarter with $13.2 million compared to $19.7 million in the year-ago quarter. This quarter continued to reflect a more normal competitive pricing environment, where as the year-ago quarter benefitted from unusually favorable market condition which produced higher than normal gains on sale of mortgages. 88% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by homebuilding operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume down from 47% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company during the quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. David? David V. Auld: At the end of June, we had 20,500 homes and inventory, of which 1,500 were models, 10,000 were speculative homes with 31,100 of the specs being completed. Our construction and progress and finished homes inventory increased by $518 million during the quarter. And now it represents 46% of our inventory balance. The highest percentage continues. This component of our inventory is the fastest turning portion of the inventory investment. At June 30, our lot portfolio consisted of a 125,000 owned lots with an additional 54,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 66,000 of our lots are finished with half owned and optioned. Our land held for development totaled 17,000 lots down 22% from March. As we continue to proactively work through the older inactive land to redeploy the capital and improve inventory turns, cash flow and the overall return on investment. With a 179,000 total lots owned and controlled we are in a strong position to compete in a current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in those sales and closings in the coming years. In the third quarter, our investment and lots, land and development totaled $665 million, of which $456 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $209 million were spent on land development. Our investment and lots, land and development for the first nine months of the year excluding the Crown and Regent acquisitions totaled $1.7 billion down from $2.1 billion last year. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: At June 30, our unrestricted home building cash, totaled $538.5 million and we had available capacity on a revolving credit facility of $657 million with no cash borrowings outstanding. Our home building leverage ratio net of cash was 34.4% and our gross home building leverage was 38.7%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $3.1 billion. $137.9 million of our senior notes mature in September and we have sufficient cash and revolver capacity to repay these notes. During the quarter the holders are 2% convertible senior notes converted their notes into 38.6 million shares of common stock, which added $500 million to paid-in capital this quarter. At June 30, our shareholders equity balance was $5 billion and book value per share was $13.63. Based on our solid balance sheet, liquidity and current and expected levels of profitability, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 67% from the most recent dividend paid to $6.25 per share. The dividend is payable on August 18, to shareholders of record on August 8. Don? Donald J. Tomnitz: In closing, we are pleased that we maintained our position as the largest builder in United States by volume for the 12 consecutive year. We are growing our volume at a faster rate than the overall industry and continue to capture additional market share. Based on the recent local leaders issue of Builder Magazine ranking homebuilders market share in the top 50 new home markets in the United States. D.R. Horton is the number one builder in four of the top 10 markets, is a top five builder in eight of the top 10 markets, has a double-digit percentage share in 10 markets, and is a top five builder in half of the top 15 new home markets. We also have a leading market share position in many markets outside of the top 50. Our leading market share position nationally and in many of our local markets provided the platform for us to produce very strong increases in a value of our sales, closings, and backlog of 32%, 28%, and 26% respectively. We generated another solid quarter of profitability with consolidated pre-tax income of $171.8 million and $2.1 billion of revenues. We have also made good progress this year towards our long-term goal producing positive cash flow from operations was still growing the business. In the first nine months of fiscal 2014, our cash used in operating activities declined by $560 million as compared to the prior year period. We expect additional substantial progress on our cash flow performance over the next year. We remain intently focused on growing our revenues at a double-digit pace with strong profits while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns on invested capital. We are very well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, and attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our tremendous operational team across the country. D.R. and I would like to personally thank our employees for your continued hard work and accomplishments. We want to specifically thank our sales people for focusing on achieving their budgeted net sales in each week in each subdivision. A key element in improving our ROI and free cash flow. Keep it up and let\u2019s finish our fiscal year out strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any question. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS. Please proceed with your question David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, everybody. Donald J. Tomnitz:  Good morning, David. Bill W. Wheat: Good morning, David. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : My first question was about the level of incentives you guys are offering and what I\u2019m trying to figure out is are you finding that other builders are kind of coming out and matching you on these incentives. And if so is there an endgame, when you said look it doesn't make sense anymore, we might sell more homes for a short period of time, but eventually it\u2019s just kind of a zero sum game or do you find that the competition is a little more reluctant to come after you guys given that you probably have a better cost structure and can still make money maybe at little bit lower price? Donald J. Tomnitz: We really have not noticed the other builders coming after us as you mentioned. And I think that's reflected in their sales increases that most of them have reported so far compared to our sales increase. So as a result I don't believe that it\u2019s adversely affecting the market for other builders. We\u2019re focused on our key strategy of hitting our minimum absorption for community for a week, so that we can generate a higher return on our inventory and generate free cash flow for our investors. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : And then just as a follow-up on the warranty \u2013 the change in warranty, nothing specific happening there, there wasn't anything underlying that, no change in terms of increased claims or anything like that just kind of normal fluctuations or is there anymore to read into that? Donald J. Tomnitz: Just normal fluctuations, nothing specific in the quarter that occurred, no specific charges. The comparison to the prior-year period we had received some more infrequent cash reimbursements in the prior-year quarter. This quarter we received no such reimbursements. So it's just simply a normal fluctuations. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : Hey, guys. Great job in the quarter. Wanted to get some clarity I guess. You made the comment I think you used the phrase stable demand earlier on in your prepared remarks and obviously the new home sales numbers came out and look like it was a pretty squishy number. Know that that\u2019s not the most reliable metric of all, but I wanted to see if you could clarify that. Particularly in the context of your commentary about discounting being up, and Bill\u2019s comment that I think you said generally you look for about a 20% gross margin which is obviously lower than \u2013 significantly lower than what you kind of been doing if you make the adjustments for the one-time event. So was curious if you could just sort of talk about what you mean by seeing stable demand in the context of you discounting in the comment on gross margins? Thanks. Bill W. Wheat: Well, in terms of our comment on stable demand we saw a significant increase in demand in 2013. And we saw a significant price appreciation in 2013. And so the levels of demand a year ago had increased dramatically. We all know that has moderated some since then and as we assess this spring, we would say on an overall basis the demand is relatively stable with where it was last year. Obviously there are significant variations across our markets. Some markets were still seeing increasing demand, others are flatter. Generally in most markets we are seeing less price appreciation here this quarter. So really from our perspective settling into a more normal pattern perhaps modest growth, modest price appreciation, but not as dramatic as a year ago. Same thing for our incentives. A year ago our incentive levels were very low, extremely low. Now that is simply moving back to a more normal level and so reflectively than we would expect our margins to return to a more normal level, which is really around that 20% level. The margins when they get a point, two points, two and a half points higher than that 20% level are really the exception rather than the rule over the long-term. Donald J. Tomnitz: And as we said for years, Steve, we said the normal margins in this industry are somewhere between 18% and 22% and our goal is to hit a 20% gross margin, 10% SG&A, and 10% pretax operating margin. So that\u2019s our focus and it continues to be our focus. Bill W. Wheat: And our number one focus is generating a 20% return on investment community by community and that is \u2013 that requires us balancing our pace, our pricing, our incentives, and our margin I guess volumes to maximize really the return. And so yes, we\u2019ll give some incentive to achieve 25% sales increase will take that train. Donald J. Tomnitz: We are in a strong position if you take a look at out total lot inventory of 175,000 lots and I\u2019ve said after quarter after quarter after quarter our people have done a great job of buying land on lots at a very early time in the recovery. And what we are doing is taking those lots, putting homes on them and producing very good margins based upon our low costs in land on lots. Now important to realize this is community by community, every community has a different target depending on its own situation, there is certain market were our lot suppliers are more constrained, but we cannot replace the lots we have whether it\u2019s very limited housing inventory. And so in those markets, our target absorptions are lower and we will push prices more there. Because that is the path to higher return in those communities, other communities there is not such good strengths and the best path is to drive volume at a consistent pace. Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital : That\u2019s very helpful, thanks very much. Regarding the volume, we obviously are hearing about your plans across the price spectrum to grow pretty significantly and it looks very intriguing. One of the things that we gotten as pushback from folks is the Commonwealth, it sounds like an incredibly bold market strategy. In environment that frankly doesn't sound so bullish. My interpretation is that your strategy is not actually characterized, cannot be categorized as a bull market share. I was wondering if you could respond in your own words that the proliferation of your communities plant openings and Emerald, Express and D.R. Horton and in the context of somebody saying that\u2019s sounds like a bull market strategy. Bill W. Wheat: I think it\u2019s a very conservative strategy and if you look at our creation and our expansion of our express model. That\u2019s creating a lot of the bullish scenario associated with our sales and we are in a limited number of markets now both our Express really in 22 markets in each stated and obviously we have 79 markets in 27 states and wish to expand the Express. With an ASP of $156,000 this quarter on Express, we feel very bullish about the opportunity to continue to expand Express and I think that will contribute to our higher than industry level sales on a go forward basis, simply because we have chosen apart of the market that we believe truly as underserved. And as I said last quarter a portion of the market that we feel comfortable is going to grow with the higher rate than the other parts of the market and that\u2019s why we chose to leverage up ourselves and expand into Express, and as well we clearly believe there is demand in that segment of the market that there is no supply board. And so we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an aggressive strategy, that just simply addressing a need in the market. Donald J. Tomnitz:  We also Steve, are leveraging of existing profitable platforms, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re jumping into new markets that we don\u2019t have operating platforms in today. To me it\u2019s a very conservative later take demand is a market today. David V. Auld: We are not trying to do Greenfield as a market, so we don\u2019t know anything about, we no a lot about the markets. We\u2019re just opening our new brand, which we feel like the market is being underserved. Stephen S. Kim \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot guys. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had a question, first off on the timing and pattern of the incentives if there is any way to give a little more detail there. In terms of, you mentioned that obviously, you want to get to a certain pace and incentives were particularly low. and now you\u2019ve taken it back to normal, but I\u2019m curious if that occurred maybe towards the beginning of the second quarter, or the late in the end of \u2013 late at the end of your fiscal first quarter, or is it something that has the spring selling season been in maybe in fully materialized to your more hopeful expectations in the May, June timeframe, you\u2019ve kind of cranked it up then? Donald J. Tomnitz: (Indiscernible) please. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : And I\u2019m sorry, and also if the incentives were more prevalent in some markets versus others. Donald J. Tomnitz: Actually, occurred in March, and we had our division presence meeting in April, and that\u2019s at which point in time, we focus with our division presence on hitting their full form of absorption level on a community-by-community basis, because we fell like that if they give that and they would achieve the ROIs, return on inventories that they have projected and the return on inventories that we won it. And again, the incentive levels will vary by community-to-community as Bill said earlier, where they are a shortage of lots, or we can\u2019t replace those lots with the cost basis we have in them and we\u2019re going to maximize our gross margins and our absorptions are going to go at a slower pace. But as David said, where we have larger inventory of loss, and we can easily price those lots, and that\u2019s going to be the business model where we\u2019re focusing on higher absorptions and lower gross margins. I want to emphasize though, if you look at our three product lines, Express where we\u2019re going to have lower margins and higher absorptions, Emerald, where we\u2019re going to have lower absorptions and higher margins, and both of those are going to blend right in to D.R. Horton margins. And once again, I don\u2019t want anybody to get confused, our overall company goal is 20,10,10, 20% gross margin, 10% 10% SG&A and 10% of the PTI lines, with a 20% net ROI community-by-community. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : So in terms of that 20% goal Don, I mean, last quarter, I believe you said it\u2019s a company that you talked going forward, gross margins in a range of the prior four quarters, which is in a kind of a 21% to 22% range, was more sustainable. it seems like you are more kind of revising that more based towards, saying that you said on a much longer basis that is just again this 20, 10, 10, is that fair? Donald J. Tomnitz: As I\u2019ve mentioned to Steve, and I\u2019ll say it again and again, as said ever since we have been doing these conference calls, the normal gross margins on this industry, a range between 18% to 22%, we believe a normalized gross margin for ourselves, or somewhere right at the 20% level. and we were very fortunate and early stages of the recovery where we have a lot of pricing power, there was a lot of increase in medium prices of homes across the country, because I had, the market had overreacted in a lot of markets, and prices that decline more than they probably should have, but normal margins for us are 20%, 10% and as Bill said, a 20% level line. Bill W. Wheat: I mean, Don, speaking to the longer-term \u2013 longer-term expectations, which that is clearly specific to the guidance we gave last quarter that was targeted more towards the next few quarters. And I\u2019d like the low end of that range, would have been around 21.4%. So our margins did come in below the low end of the range that we gave. Specifically, the causes for that would have been the purchase accounting impact and the fluctuation that we had in the warranty and construction defect claims, outside of those, would have been within the range. and then going forward, over the long-term, we expect to fluctuate around the 20%, but again, focusing on returns. But if you look at a very important metric and we\u2019ll do this all day long. We can get a 25% to 28% increase in sales, quarter-over-quarter and only have to give up 90 basis points on incentives. That\u2019s a win-win for us in our shareholders. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : I appreciate that and thanks for the additional color, Bill. I guess one last one, the SG&A I think you said that 20 bips was due to some of the stock comp related expense. but even without that, SG&A was on a percentage basis roughly similar to year ago on a 28% revenue growth. So but we expected maybe a little bit of leverage there on a percentage basis on a year-over-year basis. Any thoughts around that, and are there any items that we\u2019re not taking to account? Bill W. Wheat: I think we\u2019re going to continue to see further leverage in the SG&A. Sales are still pacing at a pretty good level ahead of \u2013 with revenues and ahead of revenues, and we\u2019re still building some of the infrastructure to support that growth that we\u2019re seeing in the brand launches and the platforms across the country as we do that. So I think we\u2019re going to see better leverage on our SG&A into the fourth quarter. And then coming closer to \u2013 back to our historical target of 10% in the next year with the leverage we\u2019ll attain on the SG&A. We believe that\u2019s a good problem that we have, and that is our SG&A is growing to support our extraordinary growth in sales and our backlog. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And the better leverage for 4Q would be on a year-over-year basis as well or just sequentially? Bill W. Wheat: Certainly sequentially. Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Dan M. Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Thanks very much. Good job in terms of responding to the market. I think historically, you guys have always done well in terms of balancing the pace and price there. Wondering as you talked about the 90 basis points in terms of the second quarter margins, presumably some of the \u2013 what you\u2019re doing with the incentives were to generate sales that will be closing \u2013 sorry, the second calendar quarter of its third fiscal. But if we think about the fourth fiscal quarter here, some of those would like to be coming two or three, that\u2019s more of a hit to margins in the coming quarter from this impact. Bill W. Wheat: We\u2019re not necessaries for giving specific guidance from next quarter, or the next quarter. in terms of margins, we are going to continue to balance the incentive to what we see in the marketplace and we still close a significant percentage of homes in the same quarter in which we sell them. So there is some reflection of the current market in our closings each quarter, but our overall guidance has really built the longer-term. We\u2019re going to fluctuate around 20%, some quarters we may be higher than that, some quarters we may not. Dan M. Oppenheim \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thanks. So our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland form Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks very much. Is there anyway to quantify how much incentives have increased versus earlier in the year 2013? Jessica Hansen : Mike, we really look at it in terms of the impact on our gross margin. and so the biggest impact we\u2019ve seen from incentives so far in 2014 would be this quarter, with the 90 basis points, there are also some cost increases associated with those 90 basis points, but for the most part, that is incentives. So we\u2019ll continue to see how that falls out, that we really just to try to talk about it in terms of how it impacts our gross margin. Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. and then just when you look at the entire housing complex, what would say is the biggest limiting factor preventing more robust housing recoveries, credit is an employment, is the labor availability constraining the ability of builders to construct homes? Donald J. Tomnitz: It\u2019s the biggest impediment of the housing industry continues to be job growth. and I still say that we continue to create a lot of temporary jobs and part-time jobs, and my comment is, is that part-time workers are now looking for a house, or looking for a full-time job. so I think combined the major thing that we can do to help the housing industry and all industries is to create permanent jobs and better paying jobs. and secondly to have a consumer confidence level where people can wake up in the morning, feel good about what\u2019s going on in the economy and then the rights, so those two factors continue to drive our business more than anything else, but jobs, jobs, jobs is what grows our industry. Michael A. Roxland \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. our next question is coming from Stephen East from ISI Group. please proceed with your question. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Thanks. good morning, guys. you talked about the gross margin expectations et cetera moving back to 20 \u2013 and I assume the global warming, maturity of that is going to be in your core D.R. Horton product. but if you look at express, where you are today with its volumes, where would you expect that the sort of run through over the next two or three years, and how much of that would be driving this move back down to a 20% gross margin? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, we\u2019re underwriting as Jessica said earlier in the conference call, we\u2019re underwriting our express, as well as our D.R. Horton are at 20% gross margin, I\u2019d say 20% return, which then basically employs that are turning in our inventory couple times a year, but our gross margin as we said would be less than the 20% level. Yes. Jessica Hansen : And Steven, so what you\u2019re actually seeing so far, I would say is better than expected margins on express, and they are trending relatively close to that 20% range, just high of that that made change as we go forward, because as we said multiple times throughout the call, we are focused first and foremost on that 20% ROI. And if we\u2019re turning to inventory quick enough, as Don said, we can work for a little bit less gross margins. but in terms of our gross margin, a guidance, which really, isn\u2019t guidance, but in terms of it being around that 20% that\u2019s just a combination of our day-to-day business and isn\u2019t really an expectation of Express, becoming a bigger piece of our business. It will become a bigger piece of our business, but we think we can run all three brands combined and put out somewhere around a 20% gross margin over the long-term. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. Donald J. Tomnitz: You asked about how big it could be. we haven\u2019t put necessarily specific targets on how big it could be. We\u2019re still on the very early stages. we do expect substantial growth in Express and Emerald, that we expected to grow as well, but we haven\u2019t necessarily put a specific target as far as percentage of the business, and really different times in the cycle, different economic conditions, the percentages of the business may fluctuate about. but clearly, right now, we expect substantial growth from where we are today. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay. Bill W. Wheat: As Jessica said right now, our Express is running about 20% gross margin, even though it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re underwriting it for less, but we think that will probably decline some over the years. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Sure, got you. and then different subject, if you just look at the order progression through the quarter, we got noised the June absorptions much lower than the prior two months is better as one \u2013 what your progression looks like, did you see that in just any color on July. Jessica Hansen : And really just on July what we said on that call, that we\u2019re continuing to see year-over-year improvement in our July sales. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re pleased just like we were in Q2 thus far we\u2019re not finished with July, but we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve seen. Bill W. Wheat: And really we saw strong steady sales pace really throughout all three months of the quarter, typically when you get into June you start to see a little bit of seasonal slowdown, but we didn\u2019t see very much. So, overall now we will still see good, consistent demand all three months. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you our question today is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Please, proceed with your question. Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Thanks. My question, I recognize this is all done at community level, but if you look at the company wide average how was \u2013 how are the absorptions now, relative to the budgets, and employment is getting added there, you think there is further need to tweak some things to get things going or do you have the pace where you want it. David V. Auld: Adam its David, what I\u2019ve experienced out in the field for 25 years is that nothing drives margins higher than consistent absorption. And we are right now operating pretty much on our budget on a community by community basis without anything unusual from a concession standpoint than what would be at historical norm. And part of look we believe as we drive consistent absorption in these communities we will be able to maximize margin, not continue to or see a deterioration of margin. And right now we are getting consistent absorptions throughout our communities. Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And then totally different topic, the Crown acquisition \u2013 Atlanta seem like a market in the past a lot of big builders had shied away from \u2013 I think the new general criticism of it had been the segmentation of it. So, could you talk about what you saw on that opportunity and really what you liked about it? David V. Auld: We liked about that opportunity was a geographic footprint within the Atlanta market itself that, we weren\u2019t serving well that grounded in very good job of serving with the very efficient platform, great team of people, very happy to have those on as part of our organization. And Atlanta is a very large housing market in the country. It will, it is on the rebound and permits growing there. Job growth has been good in Atlanta. And we are seeing very good demand in a broad range of the submarkets around Atlanta. Donald J. Tomnitz: And frankly their operating metrics as well as the just our style of operation reminded us so much of our formative days. And D.R. Horton the company and we are operating with very little capital and having do rolling option contracts and turning our inventory more quickly. And so we think that we\u2019ll able to take what they are doing now and transition that over into some of our other operations were perhaps, we\u2019re not as entrepreneurially oriented as we use to be or they are. So, great learning experience for us and they protested where well on our Division President meeting that we have in April. And already began the transfer ideas from them to us and from us to them. Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you and our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleaveland Research Company. Please, precede your few questions. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : Thanks. Two things first of all I\u2019m curios if you could give us some sense of breadth and depth of where that is and the trend that we should expect moving forward obviously you stepped up effectively this quarter. But I\u2019m trying to figure it are you at a level now that you feel is effective enough or do you see a need to continue to increase the amount of that breadth of the incentive efforts. Bill W. Wheat: Well if you take a look at our net sales orders having increased 32% in value and our backlog having increased 26% in value. We believe, we\u2019re at a really sweet spot. And we don\u2019t see the real need to increase it significant over where it is today. And a matter of fact we might be able to decrease at some because obviously, we have industry leading sales increases, closing increases and backlog increases. So, we are far head of our competition at this stage. Donald J. Tomnitz: And at the same time, its very difficult to make general comments about it. We can talk overall \u2013 overall we are very pleased with where we are and we are hitting our expectations, but it\u2019s really managed community-by-community. So there will be communities where we can led off on incentives and raised prices and improved margin, that will be others \u2013 where we will have to increase. But, in general the overall results of what we done collectively across all our communities. We are pleased with the pace that we\u2019re at, and overall wouldn\u2019t expect to have to increase it from here. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : Great, and then just within that \u2013 I know you commented that a component of those incentives were invested for the completions in this current quarter that would have showed up in these financials. I just trying to get sense of how much the incentive investment would have shown in the gross margin in this current quarter versus how much is yet to show in the closings that will come in the coming quarter? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Eric. That 33% of the homes we sold this quarter were actually close to this quarter as well. So, I kind of said that backwards. That sold and closed in the same quarter was 33%, of our closing. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : And then the second question interested in the strategic thinking at this point in a cycle with land purchases and how you are thinking about \u2013 the desire the demand to add more land to inventory I know that you continue to be active there. But how are you thinking about that in terms of the magnitude and if the type of land that you are acquiring and that\u2019s changing at all. Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, as we said on the conference call, the vast majority of our spend was associated with just replacing lots, that we have rolled through roll off over the course of the past two quarters to three quarters, and rest of those actually on land development spend which was on developing loss that we had already purchased the land on. So, we believe again, we have a total of 178,000 \u2013 175,000 total lots and that\u2019s about a 4 point \u2013 eight or nine year supply based upon on our trailing 12 month sales. So, we feel like that, we are in a very, very strong position that we are not out there in marketplace today, paying higher price for land, that we\u2019ve got a great land inventory as we said quarter-after-quarter, with that very, very low cost basis in it. So, we are being very conservative on that land purchasing right now. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Good morning, all. Donald J. Tomnitz: Good morning. Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : So, pretty exciting quarter here. You guys result obviously on a company basis reflect your initiatives whether it's Express or the numerous acquisitions. Yet I wonder if you have an adjective an early one, Don, for 15 given. I think income lack of income is a big and that\u2019s missing this time but if you're looking at 20% gross margin I heard it a lot longer-term. Can you talk about how you're responding and if Bill I know you are doing it community by community, but I think that \u2013 markets like Sacramento and Phoenix were new sales are down rising existing inventory those are once distressed markets could you talk about what's happening there from your perspective and contrast that with the new home sales number today that had the South obviously Texas is a big number in there, where you're having down sales there which obviously you are having job growth and income growth. So you do you really view that market more as supply constraint and could you contrasted with the distressed market please. Thank you. Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, first of all I\u2019m going to state\u2026 Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets :  That was first question\u2026 David V. Auld:  And I\u2019m going to answer the way I\u2019ve been answering here for the last quarter or actually the last four or five quarters. I do not want to get into specific markets and talk about the strength or weaknesses in the individual market, and yes I read the same things about Sacramento and Phoenix and those different markets and we are experiencing pretty much what everybody else is experiencing in those markets. So they are both difficult markets. Donald J. Tomnitz: But clearly in Texas, when you look at our south central region in the sales we\u2019re reporting clearly we are not down in Texas, clearly we are up substantially in our sales in Texas. So we would be \u2013 that would be gaining market share for us in Texas. Jessica Hansen :  We haven\u2019t had time to actually look at the new home sales numbers and they came out the minute our call started. That being said, Ken I mean we are battled a lot of times when we see it, because it doesn\u2019t necessarily look the same as what we are seeing in our internal results for those period. Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Okay, that\u2019s fair and I do understand it\u2019s just there is obviously several different markets occurring. How about this then? Given what you\u2019ve talked about and I appreciate the sequential breakdown in gross margin. With price flattening cost going up generically it\u2019s all pace. Can you talk about the spread this quarter and last quarter relative to units closed from backlog versus spec units with you guys drive a lot of volume through? Thank you. Donald J. Tomnitz:  Spec versus build jobs as we\u2019ve said in the last couple of quarters. We\u2019re getting closer to our normal spread we\u2019re a little bit lower margins on specs and than build jobs, but the gap is still higher then it has been over the long-term. So really no concerning trends there. Jessica Hansen :  And same thing as usual for us Ken, that about 80% of the homes we closed this quarter were spec. So, when you see our reported gross margin that is essentially our spec gross margin. Donald J. Tomnitz:  I don\u2019t want anyone to get confused, we\u2019re trying to explain to you what the historical gross margins have been in the industry 18% to 22%. And we\u2019re not saying our margins are going to 20% whatever, we\u2019re just basically trying to set a reasonable expectation out there right now. Because we believe that pricing has moderated over the last probably nine months to 12 months. Costs are definitely increasing as our subcontractors and our vendors continue to try to raise their prices given where they had to take their prices so low during the downturn. So, we\u2019re finding increasing prices with moderating increases in sales prices and we believe that the norm as Bill said earlier, we are going to gravitate back to a more normal level, certainly 2013 was not a normal level in terms of gross margins, and land supply, and cost and everything else. So, we believe it\u2019s going to gravitate back to a more traditional level, which is 20% gross margins. Bill W. Wheat: The level will not gravitate back, that will increase is our return on inventory. Return on investment will increase and that is if you want to measure the progress of our strategy and how we execute our business, watch our increasing returns on investment quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter over the next couple of years because our plan is for that to increase steadily. And we believe that returns are much more important to our overall performance and helping the company then one element on the P&L then gross margin is returns. Kenneth Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets :  Thank you. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.:  Good morning, everyone. First question I have with this focus on a 20% community level of return is that means that the 10,000 specs, this quarter is probably the top for the cycle? Donald J. Tomnitz:  We are not called anything on cycle. But clearly we drive, as Jessica, said 80% of our closing come from spec. So clearly we prepare for a volume level and our spec are an indicator of what our expectations are. But we don\u2019t believe we are at a peak of cycle at all. We are just out there competing in the market and responding market by market. David V. Auld: As a matter of fact we strongly believe the market will gradually grow and perhaps in a year or two grow even faster simply because the part of the market that's underserved and largely it's underserved because of the ASP is the entry-level buyer, and also the mortgage underwriting standards are still high relative to where they have been in the past. I expect mortgage underwriting standards to moderate hopefully not back to the level they were back end in 2004, 2005 and 2006 that we believe that the underwriting standards will be moderated some and by virtue of us being able to offer Express homes, 156,000 current ASP and if we get any relief on the mortgage underwriting, we think the home building business is ready to take off especially as it applies to the entry-level buyer. James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: That kind of \u2013 into my second question, because I think this is to disconnect all those we are trying to get to because from the outside looking and right now you guys are cutting back on you land spending, you are increasingly pushing out your absorption to try to push them up even on land that may not be in the best markets right now, but then you are coming back and saying that you think that there is growth ahead for the homebuilding industry. I mean is that plus this change in language from the last conference call to this conference call where you are talking much more about return on the inventory rather than stable gross margins that you discussed last quarter. There is a disconnect there that I think we are all trying to figure out what changed from the last conference call to now? Bill W. Wheat:  Hey, Jay. On your land \u2013 comment about land we are not decreasing our land investment, we are maintaining what we believe is that adequate substantial land investment around 179,000 lots owned and controlled, 125,000 lots owned. So we are replacing, we bought early in the cycle, we believe that that level will support double-digit growth on the top line, which is still our expectation. We\u2019ve always been focused on return, we\u2019ve always been focused on balancing our volume and our pricing to optimize our returns. As we move through the spring and we\u2019ve adjusted incentives the gross margin line has adjusted, but at the same time we believe that\u2019s more than balanced by our increase in volume. And so we are not pulling back, there is really been no shift from that perspective which essentially delivering stronger returns on the investments we\u2019ve made. Michael Murray : And I said earlier in the conference call and I said this for three of four quarters on a row, we\u2019ve made really, really good land buys early in the market, we\u2019ve about 4.7 year supply of random lots today and we\u2019ve got about a 2.4 year supply of finished lots today all based up on a trailing 12-month sales space of about 27,000 units. So we think that it\u2019s incredibly strong statement to say that we don\u2019t have to be forcing ourselves on the land side like some of our competitors are and having to go out and buy a land today. We got adequate lands at great cost basis. As far the return side of the business, we have looked at our business upside down and sidewise and there is one thing that we\u2019ve concluded. We concluded the good gross margin as a good thing, but if you are only generating one net sale for subdivision with a 25% gross margin, that\u2019s not nearly as well as generating a 16% gross margin with return of sales for month in the subdivision. So our focus is on how do we improve our return on inventory because that\u2019s the bottom line, that\u2019s the best way we can increase our share holder value is that by consistently receiving a solid return on inventory, not necessarily having an arbitrary gross margin levels that has a very low return on it. James McCanless \u2013 Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the explanation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to \u2013 I wanted to kind of dig into the incentive question here a little bit as well. When your folks were thinking about this back in March, looking ahead to this quarter, I wanted to get understanding of what you were seeing on the ground that led to change in your thinking at this point, because obviously demand has been slow for about a year ago. If you think about incentives, they can lower price. and I think you made it up very well, and clearly, very successful with the amount of order growth you\u2019ve got. If affordability is stretched, then the incentives of reducing price can obviously spur some sales. if you have skittish buyers, then offering incentives can probably bring them in, just diverting traffic from competitors more from the resale market. so what were you seeing in the ground thinking about in that those terms that led you to the correct conclusion that if we increase our incentives a little bit, we will be able to generate such a significant increase in sales like you did? Donald J. Tomnitz: Let\u2019s go back to one thing that really drove our incentives, and a lot of those have to deal with David Auld, coming up here and spending some time, analyzing where we were and what we were doing. But he is known for years that we needed to hit the absorption level that we have projected when we funded a land deal and we have been reluctant and sometimes reticent to drive those absorptions at that level they were projected to be, because we\u2019re trying to hold to a specific gross margin. And we\u2019ve included that having a specific gross margin in the subdivision and not being to able to turn our inventory as frequently as we need to is not exactly the most optimum return on our money. so what really drove our incentives, not necessarily the market, not necessarily what we saw in the market, what drove our incentives was we are committed to hitting our absorptions and we believe by hitting our absorptions that we can deliver a higher return on inventory and a better return for investors. so that\u2019s what drove our incentives. Jessica Hansen : And so Nishu, whatever that takes on a community-by-community basis, it will let to it is what it is, because we\u2019re going to do what we need to do to hit that targeted ROI. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, I understand all that. and your folks of the Express did pretty well. What I was trying to ask is to, like something even from buyer perspective, if it\u2019s a \u2013 if it\u2019s more of a unique luxury community than affordability is probably not the constraint. so an incentive doesn\u2019t work, but if it\u2019s an entry-level community, where there are four competitor communities, or they are distressed properties perhaps to look at our single family homes for rent and incentive makes it more affordable maybe, it gives the person more confidence. So I was trying to understand what you saw in the ground from a buyer behavior perspective, clearly made the right call, because your volumes increased so much. so I was trying to understand from a little bit of a different angle? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, I\u2019m not so sure that I agree with your comments that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 the incentives don\u2019t drive the high ends, as much as at both the low end, because I can say as we were selling Emerald homes, or even our normal D. R. Horton, someone coming in and looking at the $289,000 average sales price home, or a $655,000 average sales price Emerald home. They are looking for the best deal, and so as a result, incentives do drive that into the market as well as driving incentives us on the low end of the market. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. The 20% return on inventory that you\u2019ve been mentioning in the return on capital, I was wondering if you could \u2013 it sounds like you are describing the internal metric and the external metric. So I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail on that, the return on inventory, the 20% is that like the divisional metric that\u2019s \u2013 are you asking the divisional managers to focus on what\u2019s in that and then that kind of corporate level metric, how are you defining that? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, it is at our division level it\u2019s on an annual basis, is the pretax income that division generates, divided by the average inventory balance. And just to give you where we are currently today, we are sitting at around 13.5%, that is our run rate on our internal ROI and so that target is to get that our guys get our divisions up to 20% or better. On a company wide level, return on invested capital, obviously that\u2019s a very well calculation obviously to the extend that we do a better job internally with our guys at ROI, our return on invested capital will be better for the company, which you can just as easily simply look at return on inventory for us, look at pretax income divided by our average inventory for the company as well and it would be pretty similar. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Yes, I was wondering if you could talk about what kind of earnings growth do you think the double-digit revenue growth that you mentioned will translate in? Bill W. Wheat: Well, we would hope to grow our profits faster than our revenue pace. And as we generate returns, faster returns, faster cash flows that we could redeploy into the business faster than we\u2019ve been able to in the past, then we would expect that earnings growth to be able to continue to grow faster. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay. So just a follow-up on that is the main driver of that earning growth is going to be lower SG&A then because the gross margin relative to where it\u2019s been is declining? Bill W. Wheat: I\u2019m sorry you cutout just a little bit there. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Sorry, just to follow-up is the main driver of getting to that faster than the double-digit revenue growth in earning is the main driver are going to be lower SG&A since the gross margin is a headwind going forward? Bill W. Wheat: There would certainly be some leverage there as well, but as you turn your inventory faster and redeploy, redeploy it faster than there is simply more capital available on an ongoing basis to generate growth and profits over the long-term. This is a long-term measurement that you could be looking at. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, are you willing to comment on what you would expect for operating and free cash flow in the fourth quarter? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, we don\u2019t make specific quarter comments on that, but it can be volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but what we would comment on as we expect our operating cash flow metric to continue to improve here, and out returns to continue to improve. And our goal is to get to a point where we are both growing the company, growing revenues at double-digit pace while improving our returns in and getting to a positive cash flow position. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: And just to follow-up, do you think the fourth quarter operating and free cash flow are likely to be positive. In other words more cash flow generated from home sales then to replenish inventory Bill W. Wheat: Again, we\u2019re not going to comment on one quarter of cash flows, but it's certainly possible, but it's that we\u2019re not going to comment on one quarter cash flows measures. Specifically our goal is in fiscal year 2015, free cash flow and have free cash flow at an increasing amount and every fiscal year there after as our long-term goal. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  And just a clarification on the 20% gross margin is that inclusive of the purchase accounting charges for the next three quarters or that\u2019s before that. Bill W. Wheat:  Yes, inclusive. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you, our next question is comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Hey, good morning. Good ASP performance you are hitting tough comps in the back half of the year. What's your thoughts on pricing, how should we think of ASP performance going forward. Bill W. Wheat: Stable to slightly improvement in general. Again we\u2019re in a \u2013 what we believe is a relative stable environment is going to depend on geographic mix and product mix obviously but we're not seeing dramatic price decreases and also we would expect relatively stable environment Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Would you quantify that as mid single-digit, high single-digit or low single-digit? Jessica Hansen : That\u2019s a hard one Bob just because we have three different product types now in terms of our brands and we don\u2019t know what the market\u2019s going to deliver, so we\u2019re going to stay we\u2019re just similar to slightly up. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Cool. Understood. 13.5% on the way to 20% what it your mind just for trajectory for that to happen what has to fall into place to close the gap? Thanks Donald J. Tomnitz: We need to continue to hit our unit absorptions on a week by week basis and each subdivision and that's the best way \u2013 currently as ramp 13% to 14% our goal is 20% and that will probably take two or three year time period for us to achieve that but it's hitting those of absorption net per week per subdivision on a consistent basis as David said. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Hi, guys I apologize for the late question going over a quick clarification I just want to be sure that they were clear that the order count the 25% growth in the order count reported. Does that include the 431 homes acquired from Crown in the quarter? Donald J. Tomnitz:  No not. Their opening backlog is not included in the 25% order growth. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates: Any of those sales from Crown included in the 25% I guess\u2026 Donald J. Tomnitz: The sales we made post the acquisition to the end of the quarter 296 sales I believe we\u2019re included in that 25% order growth. Buck Horne \u2013 Raymond James & Associates:  Okay, but otherwise it\u2019s clean. Okay, and what was the community count X the Crown acquisition or, the active community count. Jessica Hansen :  We were up 7% on year-over-year basis without Crown. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Krapfel from Morningstar. Please proceed with your question. James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Inc.:  Hi, thanks for taking my question. How much were cost per square foot up in the quarter. Jessica Hansen : Our cost per square foot were up year-over-year I have that somewhere. Sorry 8.3%. James Krapfel \u2013 Morningstar Inc.: Okay, and then what\u2019s your forward outlook on labor do you expect some moderation and labor inflation there and then also in terms of land. To look out maybe two years based on where you underwritten plan holding all else how much would you expect there to be gross margin decrement just from that the higher price land going to cost itself. Thanks. Jessica Hansen :  Right now we are seeing more of an impact I\u2019d say on the labor side and our land still continues to be a benefit because we were early movers and in terms of our stick and brick costs we are seeing some pressure on the material side. But more so on the labor side its specifically in those local markets where we\u2019ve seen pretty good growth in volumes. Donald J. Tomnitz: We think we moderate our labor costs as clearly were 40% larger and the second builder and we believe those kinds of volumes are going to help control our costs much better that our competition. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Joel Locker from, FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: Hi guys. Just a commenting on the community count if you include Crown just at the quarter end what was your community count up year-over-year third quarter last year and then sequentially also. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Joel. We were up about 11% including Crown and sequentially we were flat. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: You are flat? And that was, that was the quarter and community count not the average community count? Jessica Hansen : We will talk about in terms of our average and just to give a good representation and let me correct myself with Crown sequentially we are up 4%. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: You are up 4%. And 11% year-over-year. Jessica Hansen : Yes. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: And then, just last question on what was your dollar amount of customer deposits you had at third quarter end. Jessica Hansen : If its one second. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: Customer deposits. Jessica Hansen : About $53 million. Joel T. Locker \u2013 FBN Securities, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Housing Research Centre. Please proceed with your question. Alex Barr\u00f3n \u2013 Housing Research Center : Good morning guys. Good job on the orders. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you. Alex Barr\u00f3n \u2013 Housing Research Center : Wanted to ask you I guess if you could kind of spec little bit more, you are rationale for doing acquisitions at this point in time and how view them I guess in the future do you think the industry needs more consolidation that be more rationale? Donald J. Tomnitz: Well, frankly the way we have \u2013 Mike speaks specifically as to the acquisitions but generally speaking we are looking for builders who fit well within our business model who have a very efficient operations and also some people who \u2013 we can learn something from and just because we are the largest builder doesn\u2019t \u2013 obviously we don\u2019t have all the answers and lot of these entrepreneurial builders that Mike Murray is been working with truly have some unique ideas or certainly some ideas to remind us of the way we used to be. So as a result, I think that we are looking at been supplementing our existing markets on a number of situations and continuing to grow our market share in each of these markets as we continue to grow our market share in each one of our markets like we are in Atlanta, we get better cost and both on the labor side as well as on the material side and most importantly on the land side going forward. Bill W. Wheat: Sorry, Alex, we have a, we look builder by builder at different opportunities and look for different geographies different customer segments and were different capabilities to add to our existing platform, looking all the time for a good cultural fit. There is no set recipe or formula for what works and the motivation of the sellers also a big factor in whether we\u2019ll we have the successful transaction or not. But it\u2019s not something were driven or compel to do. But it\u2019s a good opportunity that we can take advantage of \u2013 it\u2019s going to make sense for us to do those. Alex Barr\u00f3n \u2013 Housing Research Center : Got it. And then I guess a separate question, maybe for Jessica do you some type of community counts or percentage of your over all communities that are in Emerald and Express as a percentage of total or just some absolute numbers. Jessica Hansen : No, Alex. I mean we haven\u2019t disclosed our community count and right now, we are just talking about how many markets were offering Emerald and Express in. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. Donald J. Tomnitz: Thank you. I want to remind all of our D.R. Horton employees and especially our sales people that we do not need to be deterred from our mission. We have a revised business model that is going to be very accretive and additive to our shareholders, and we need to continue to focus on our mission. We are currently in a trailing 12 months; we closed 40% more homes and the second largest builder. We want to continue to dominate our markets and to be as profitable as we can in each one of our markets, but most importantly what you can do for us as you know to set your absorptions on a community by community basis, so that we can get our return on inventory from its current 13% to 14% up to 20% because that\u2019s the best thing we can do for ourselves and our shareholders. So we thank you very much. Let's kick tail on the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld :  Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;  Before we review our business and financial results with you I\u2019d like to take a minute to recognize Don Tomnitz on his recent retirement and thank him for his leadership, advice and support over the years. On behalf of the entire D.R. Horton team I\u2019d like to congratulate him on an outstanding carrier of 31 years with the company, 15 years as our CEO. During Don\u2019s tenure we grew to become the largest homebuilder in the United States and have maintained that position for over 12 years. We look forward to still working with Don in a consulting role as he continues to be involved in a number of areas of our operations. Now onto our results. In 2014 while demand for new homes across most of our markets remained relatively stable we generated greater than 20% growth in both revenue and pre-tax income by successfully leveraging our platform as the nation\u2019s largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder. Our national market share is the largest in company history. We have closed 46% more homes than any other builder in the recently reported 12 month period and we are positioned to generate further growth.  In the fourth quarter our homes sold and closed increased 38% and 25% respectively and we had another good quarter of profitability with $250.8 million of pre-tax income and a 10.1% pre-tax operating margin. Our increase community count, well stocked supply of land, plots and homes provide us with a strong competitive position. Based on a 29% increase in the value of our sales backlog and our October sales growth that exceeded 20% on a year-over-year basis we expect further double-digit growth in home closings, revenues and pre-tax profits in 2015. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our competitive position to generate double-digit growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while improving our cash flow and increasing our returns. Mike? Michael Murray : Net income for the fourth quarter increased to 19% to $166.3 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to $139.5 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 24% to $250.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $202.8 million in the year ago quarter and home building pre-tax income increased 25% to $236.6 million compared to $189.4 million. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 33% to $2.4 billion on 8,612 homes closed, up from $1.8 billion on 6,866 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $279,100, up 6% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a 4% increase on our average home size and a small increase on our average sales price per square foot. Bill? Bill Wheat :  The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 41% from the year ago quarter to $2 billion and homes sold increased 38% to 7,135 homes on a 10% increase in average active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 2% to $281,700. The cancellation rate for the quarter was 28%, down from 31% in the year ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 29% from a year ago to $2.9 billion with an average sales price per home of $289,100 and homes in backlog increased 21% to 9,888 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 76%. We expect backlog conversion rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to be around 75%, which is higher than our long-term first quarter average. We also expect our home closings for the full year of fiscal 2015 to increase 20% to 30% compared to fiscal 2014 based on the current relatively stable housing market conditions. Please note that percentage changes in our average active community counts and our quarterly net sales orders by region for fiscal 2013 and \u201814 will be included in the supplementary data we referenced earlier which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website after this call. Jessica. Jessica Hansen :  We continue to experience strong growth in profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton branded communities which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. Our Express Homes brand, which is targeted at true entry level buyer focused primarily on affordability is now being offered in 24 markets and eight states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas and the Carolinas. This quarter Express accounted for 10% of our homes sold, 6% of homes closed and 4% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express Home in the fourth quarter was $169,000. For the year Express accounted for 7% of our homes sold, 5% of homes closed and 3% of home sales revenue. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive and we expect to have Express Homes communities open in the majority of our markets by the end of fiscal 2015. Emerald Homes, our brand for higher end move up and luxury communities is now available in 34 markets across 14 states. In the fourth quarter 7% of our homes closed were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 17% of our home sales revenue, up from 5% of homes closed and 13% in revenues in the same quarter last year. For the year 6% of our homes closed were priced higher than $500,000, accounting for 16% of our home sales revenue up from 4% in homes closed and 10% in revenues in fiscal 2013. We plan to continue to steadily introduce new Emerald Homes communities across more of our markets in fiscal 2015. Mike? Michael Murray :  Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.5%, down 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. The sequential margin decrease was primarily driven by a 70 basis point impact from cost increases in excess of sales price increases and changes in our product mix. The decrease was partially offset by a margin increase of 30 basis points from lower relative warranty and litigation cost, 10 basis points from lower interest and property tax cost and 10 basis points from a lower purchase accounting impact from acquisitions.  Our fourth quarter incentive level was essentially flat with the third quarter. Compared to the prior year our home sales gross margin decreased 140 basis points primarily to due to the combined effect of cost increases in excess of sales price increases and higher incentives. As we have discussed on previous calls our incentive levels were extremely low in most markets during fiscal 2013 and early 2014, but incentives returned to normal levels in many markets during the course of 2014 with significant variations across our communities.  With the very strong performance of our express communities so far we expect this brand to grow quickly as a percentage of our product mix which will help us generate strong growth in both revenues and profits. But will likely bring our average gross margin percentage down in fiscal 2015 from our current level. In the current stable housing environment we generally expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that can range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest cost. As a reminder our reported gross margins include all of our interest cost. Historical detail on the components impacting our home sales gross margin will be included in the supplementary data on our website after this call. Bill? Bill Wheat :  Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $241 million compared to $186.6 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A improved 40 basis points to 9.9% this quarter compared to 10.3% in the prior year quarter. Fiscal 2014 SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues was 10.6% compared to 10.7% in fiscal 2013. During 2014, we made significant investments in our SG&A infrastructure to support our current and expected growth and we expect to leverage these SG&A investments in 2014 and move closer to our annual SG&A goal of 10% of home building revenues. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2015 we expect our SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues to be seasonally higher than in our third and fourth quarters as we typically deliver fewer homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half. Jessica? Jessica Hansen :  Financial services\u2019 pretax income for the quarter increased 6% to $14.2 million from $13.4 million in the year ago quarter. 88% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our home building operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company volume this quarter down from 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. Select historical data from our mortgage company including loan product mix will also be included in the supplementary data on our website after this call. David? David Auld : At the end of September, we had 20,600 homes in inventory, of which 1,500 were models, 11,200 were spec homes and 3,900 of the specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $159 million during the quarter. Our fourth quarter investment in lots, land and development totaled $618 million of which $353 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $265 million was for land development.  In 2014 we invested $2.3 billion in land, lots and development. At September 30, 2014 our lot portfolio consisted of 125,000 owned lots with an additional 59,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 69,000 of our lots are finished with 32,000 owned and 37,000 optioned. Our 184,000 total lots owned and controlled put us in a strong competitive position in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in sales and closings in future periods. As we invest in new communities for all three of our brands our main underwriting criteria is a minimum annual pretax return on inventory of 20% defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory over the life of the community. We expect each community regardless of brand to achieve this target by optimizing the balance between absorptions, margins and inventory levels that is most appropriate for that community. For reference our total home building pretax return on inventory has improved 560 basis points over the past two years from 5.5% at 2012 to 11.1% in 2014 and we expect to make further improvement on this metric in 2015, as we improve our pretax profitability and manage our inventory levels efficiently. Mike? Michael Murray :  During the fourth quarter we recorded $3.2 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money and deposits -- for earnest money deposits and due diligence cost for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $18.1 million of impairment charges of which $15.7 million were in our East region primarily related to long held inactive and underperforming projects in the Washington D. C. area that we intend to sale to improve returns by redeploying the capital into more productive assets. Our inactive land held for development of $332.8 million at the end of the year represents 14,000 loss, down 17% from June and down 33% from year ago. We are proactively working through these older unproductive assets to redeploy the capital, thereby improving the cash flows and returns. We continue to formulate our operating plans for each of our remaining inactive land parcels and we expect that our land held for development balance will continue to decline during fiscal 2015. We will continue to evaluate our active land parcels for potential impairments. These evaluations may results in additional impairment charges in future periods but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past Bill? Bill Wheat : At September 30th our homebuilding liquidity included $632.5 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $582 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had $300 million of cash borrowings and $92.7 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage was 39.4% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 34.5%. During the quarter we've repaid $137.9 million of our senior notes at their maturity in September. Our homebuilding debt maturities in fiscal 2015 are $158 million and our public notes outstanding at September 30 totaled $3 billion. Our fiscal year end shareholders' equity balance was $5.1 billion and book value per share was $14.04, up 12% from a year ago, Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our future expectations which are based on the current relatively stable housing market conditions. In fiscal 2015 we expect to close between 34,500 and 37,500 homes and generate consolidated revenues of between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year in fiscal 2015 will range from 19.5% to 20.5% with potential quarterly fluctuation outside of this range. We estimate our homebuilding SG&A expense to range from 10% to 10.3% of homebuilding revenues for the full year with the first two quarters of the year being higher than this range and third and fourth quarters at the low end or below the annual range.  We expect our financial services operating margin to range from 25% to 30%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2015 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36% and our diluted share count to be approximately 370 million shares. For our first fiscal quarter 2015, we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate of around 75%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be around 19.5% to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix warranty and interest cost. And we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be around 11% of revenues, David? David Auld : In closing our fourth quarter and 2014 growth in sales, closings and profits in relatively stable market is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about our opportunities ahead. This quarter, the value of our sales and closings increased by 41% and 33% respectively and we generated another solid quarter of profitability with consolidated pretax income of $250.8 million on $2.5 billion of revenue. For the year, the value of our sales closings and backlog increased by 27%, 30% and 29% respectively and consolidated pretax income increased 24% to $814.2 million on $8 billion of revenue. We also made considerable progress this year toward our long-term goal of producing positive cash flow from operations. Whilst still growing the business our cash used in operations of $661 million improved by $570 million from last year's level and we expect further substantial progress in our cash flow performance in 2015. We remained focused on growing both our revenues and pre-tax profit at a double-digit pace while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned to do this with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, attractive finish lots and land position and most importantly our tremendous operational team across the country. I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and accomplishments this year and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations to make 2015 an even better year. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is coming from Steven Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital : Hey, guys good results. Wishing you guys a proud Veterans Day. I wanted to ask you a quick question regarding incentives. I think you had indicated that your incentives were flat sequentially, which I think is going to perceived positively by folks who have been concerned that you are going to be ramping your incentives pretty significantly. You have also talked about increasing the share of your business, your volumes that\u2019s going to be coming from Express and I was wondering if can talk specifically about your strategy around incentives as you have seen Express evolving and whether you see the approach you are going to be using for incentives being different for the Express communities, then for the Emerald or the Horton communities and what that\u2019s is going to mean for incentives going forward? David Auld :  Steve it\u2019s David. The market we find the market to be relatively stable and in fact we had significant pricing power last year in Q1, Q2 we saw that slide down, increased incentives but really just back to normal market type conditions and right now we feel pretty good about kind of where we are in the market and what\u2019s taken place out there. Michael Murray :   And in terms of our approach to you know incentives across our brand, Steven we don\u2019t see a significant change from where we have been in the past. We manage our incentives at community by community level and we go in regardless a brand with our business plan for each community and we look to achieve that and if depending on how the market responds then we adjust our incentive levels. I think that would apply to our approach really across all three of our brands. Bill Wheat :  Clearly with the Express we are providing a tremendous value to the buyer in the marketplace today and so we are not seeing a significant level of incentives across the board in Express. Community by community we are going to manage to what that market is but within Express we are seeing from market acceptance and a buyer that\u2019s been underserved. Stephen Kim - Barclays Capital :  Yeah, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s exactly what we are looking for. The second question relates to the use of speculative building and I think you guys in your prepared remarks gave us some numbers. I wanted to just generally though speak about or ask about what you are seeing in the marketplace and what\u2019s your intention going forward is with respect to the role of specular building. Some of your peers have indicated that they are sort expecting to go into the spring selling season with a higher level of spec activity with the hope of capturing those buyers who have chosen to sell their house first before trying to sign a contract for another one and so were looking for quick move in. I guess A, do you generally believe or agree the presence of this kind of buyer is -- would make having more specs than normal historically a good strategy entering spring selling season? Are you preparing for that and are you seeing your competitors taking steps to prepare for that yet? David Auld :  Have not really seen significant competition out in the market from other builders on the spec build program. That has always been what we've done. We've always tried to look at the next quarter out and align ourselves for what we believe demand will be based upon what we're seeing that day. Spec building is a good consistent way to manage communities and drive absorption that's just something we've always done. Jessica Hansen :  And as a reminder Steve about 70 to 80% of our closings each quarter are specs. So when you're looking at our reported gross margin that's essentially a spec gross margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets : David Auld : Good morning Ken. Jessica Hansen : Good morning Ken. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets : So a rather different approach to the forward year this year. The growth that you gave in terms of your closings and I think everyone is going to be happy it sounds like that you are disclosing community count, is that accurate. Jessica Hansen : We're not actually disclosing absolute community count but we are giving you two years of historical data of what our community counts done in percentage terms at a regional level. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. Then what is the underlying, and I apologize if I missed it with all the numbers you're giving but the 34,500 to 37,000 unit closing what does that imply for community count growth? Bill Wheat : In terms of community count growth we actually expect the increase in our community count we\u2019re at 10% this quarter we expect that to moderate in to 2015 and we could be relatively flat on year-over-year basis for the whole year. Any increases would be more in the mid to single digit range but clearly our expectation, as we have shown in the last couple of quarters is for improvement in our absorptions per community and that\u2019s really what we plan to drive the 20% to 30% increase in our closings next year. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Interesting. So that's actually largely coming from absorption. So related to that and David we had talked about this earlier in the year with the success you guys have been having with Express because it\u2019s going to be rising as a percent of orders and closings, if you could highlight the kind of the dynamic between the volume you're seeing and the revenue. So I think you basically said it was like 5% in closings, 3% of revenue. How does one think about the incremental flow through of you get the volumes but since it's less ASP the margins can be the same but you're pulling less dollars through? I mean do you think this 1.5 million starts certain share as it relates to single family homes, is this going to happen at a lot lower price point that Express is a characteristic of? David Auld : Well I can tell you our model, our thought process us we're going to grow every brand. Now the Express brand is going to grow faster because we're introducing a new product into an underserved market across the country and there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand that we're picking up with that brand. We're not growing Express at the expense of Horton. The Horton brand will continue to grow and the Emerald brand really were just rolling out still. I mean it's got a lot upside. Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets : Yes, I think you're heading to a sweet spot there. Is that -- the average price, is it kind of saying, did you talk about how much you think the price is down given the business, the product mix for next year? Michael Murray : I think we're looking going forward Canada at a flat ASP hard to predict because the potential changes in mix that we'll be seeing. But as David said we're looking to grow all the brands Express growing probably at a faster clip than the other brands but we're still seeing good growth in demand across all brands and still seeing some markets where we have price appreciation which helps to offset a bit of the mix changes. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan:  Hi. Thanks. Good morning and nice quarter. David Auld : Thank you. Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: The first question I had was I guess circling back to Express but asked a little bit of a different way and I think you started to hit on this in talking about community count but with your outlook for growth next year being I guess you're saying primarily driven by an increase in absorption, is that going to be primarily driven by the higher mix of Express or is there going to be perhaps growth in certain regions that maybe have a lower ASP or a faster turn. Just trying to get a sense because to have absorption up 15%, 20% or more next year I think that\u2019s probably pretty much ahead of the pack right now in terms of how most of the builders are thinking about \u201915, if haven\u2019t articulated it explicitly and so just trying to get a sense is that really the Express Homes initiative or is it a regional mix or do you have a view of certain of the markets that\u2019s a little bit different? David Auld :  Thank you. This is David, Michael. I think the Express is certainly a factor in it and regional growth is also a factor. We\u2019re very strongly positioned right now in Texas and Carolinas and Florida and those are growth markets. And so we expect to do well or better there than we have in the past and Express as we continue to roll that out we are seeing high unit absorptions there. So it\u2019s -- that\u2019s why we think overall we\u2019ll see pricing power in certain markets but the Express brand at that price point as it grows and becomes a bigger percentage is going to keep our average sales price pretty much flat and we think that\u2019s a good thing. Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan: Right, no it makes sense. And I guess just circling back on the incentives for a moment, just wanted to clarify you said that incentives in the fourth quarter were flat sequentially. I would presume that was on closings not orders so if that\u2019s correct just trying to get a sense of perhaps on an order basis the orders themselves as you are bringing in the new sales over the past three months were the incentives on those order also relatively stable versus the prior quarter and as a result should we infer that the gross margin for next year coming in a little bit is primarily driven by a mix I think as you have stated. Michael Murray :  I think that\u2019s a pretty fair characterization of everything Michael. Incentives have been flat on the closings that was correct and we are probably seeing a similar flat trend in the sales line right now. So that has brought us down for the full year margin expectations for next year from where we were in fiscal 2014. David Auld :  And clearly with Express driving much high absorptions in volume but slightly lower on a gross margin side but as it grows to a bigger mix of our overall business that\u2019s the primary driver for us moderating back to our normal gross margin range of around 20%. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group :  Thank you. David congratulations on your role. David Auld :  Thank you, Stephen. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group :  If I look at call it your first six weeks or so a couple of different questions, one where your first focus and actions have been and then when you look out a bit longer what vision do you see for Horton? Everybody has got their own twist on things so how maybe does your vision differ a little bit from DTs as you move out three, five years? David Auld :  I guess the initial focus is really getting our handle on this public position role Stephen I have always been behind the curtain kind of guy and being pushed out front is different for me. Three to five years down the road I think my goal is just to continue the excellence companies had, focus is on consistency really on a day-by-day, subdivision by subdivision execution. I feel like our position in the industry today is so unique, the fact that we have been the largest for as long as we\u2019ve been the largest, the geographic footprint that we have it really is, if we just execute and do what we can do on a day-to-day basis we should have a great three to five year run. Stephen F. East \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group :  Okay, I appreciate that. And then different topic if you look at the SG&A, your goal has always been 10% and I guess my question here is most builders yourself included have talked a lot about hey, during the downturn we've gotten a lot more efficient. We've been able to do more with less people et cetera. Why shouldn't we expect in this, maybe even in 2015 but why shouldn't we expect that SG&A to drop down below the levels you run in previous cycles? David Auld : Well, I'm probably going to get in trouble for this but that is my expectation. If we do not, because we're more efficient, we do have great operators out there, the launch of the Emerald, Express that we've been through the last couple of years, we did have to build some infrastructure and ramp up and I have told all these guys and all the people out there in the field that our expectation is to leverage that position and become more efficient. So that is my expectation. The accounts are going to disagree with me. Jessica Hansen : That might be a little bit longer term view too and not a fiscal '15 call Steven. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Rudiger from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Hi, good morning. David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that I think one of the focus was going to be to improve cash flow. Operating cash flow was negative for the past three years. So I was wondering when or if we should expect an inflection point in that and when you actually plan on starting to generate cash? David Auld :  I think right now we expect to be relatively flat this year. If the market remains stable or even gives us a little bit more we could beat that. Bill Wheat : And flat even cash flow this next year would be an improvement of $660 million. So that would be a substantial improvement but I think specifically I think we're pretty close to that inflection point. David Auld : Yes. Adam Rudiger \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities :  Okay. Second question was there has been some speculation or percolation, I guess on Texas and oil prices and things like that. I was wondering if you had any comments you wanted to share on what you've been seeing recently. I know it's pretty early but just any thoughts there would be helpful. David Auld : Texas remains strong for us. I think if oil prices stay down it could soften somewhat but any softening we see in Texas, I think low oil prices should create additional demand in the other markets. So we're Texas based but we're significant in really every market in the country that we want to be in. So it's pretty good balanced for us. Could actually be beneficial. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Hi, good morning and really nice quarter. Just wanted to get some color on the impairment charge of $21 million in the quarter. I know you had one for $57 million in 3Q. Any color about this would be great and what should we think about charges going forward? Bill Wheat : Well Bob the charges we took this quarter were primarily in our Washington D C area. We had a couple of long lived old projects that we had for a quite well that were inactive and we evaluated the market and had some opportunities to sell those projects and so we're looking to move forward with those, redeploy that capital. We\u2019ve consistently been working through our older land positions, bringing most of it into production in our home building operations and most of that not requiring an impairment charge when it comes into operations.  So looking forward we're going to continue to evaluate all these projects in the market that we're in and look to make that capital work for the company as quickly as we can. When we do elect to sell something, when that's the best option for us, that has traditionally produced the bigger impairment charges and hard to predict when or if those things will be occurring. Robert Wetenhall \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Okay, that's helpful and I think it's for Bill. You guys had a very robust balance sheet, net debt to home buildings in the mid 30's. You're obviously trying to drive better financial performance with 20% ROI inventory. What's the goal? How should we think about the balance sheet in the context of land spend is going to continue next year. Looks like you might burn a little cash as you grow the business. What's your target for net home building debt-to-capital? Thanks and good luck. Bill Wheat : You bet. Thanks, Bob. From a net debt-to-cap we've consistently said we wanted to stay out or below 40% to 45% range. Clearly we're bit below that right now and we're comfortable in the mid 30's as well and really so as long as we are in a good solid position we have flexibility. Right now our first priority as we look at our business, look at the opportunities in the marketplace to generate returns in our business and that\u2019s going to be the first priority for our investments of capital.  With that being said we feel like we are in a great position in our land position. So we are not having to grow that position significantly right now. So right now in terms of land and development expectations, spending expectations for fiscal \u201915 we would expect that to be relatively flat with fiscal \u201914, right now but that will depend also then ultimately on what we see in the sales environment in the spring, if things are much stronger than we expect in the spring we might expect -- we might wind up investing more than we did in fiscal \u201914 but conversely if you go the other way as well. So first and foremost we are going to look at the business. Secondly, we will continue to handle our debt obligations as we move forward and continue to pay the dividend. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Goldberg from UBS. Please proceed with your question. David Goldberg \u2013 UBS:  Thanks good morning everybody and congratulations David. David Auld :  Thank you, David. David Goldberg - UBS:  My first question, I was wondering if you can get a step back and just think a little bit if you guys just kind of take us through the actual procedure to determine what kind of spec you guys want heading into the next year, the spec count now under construction is up 24%-25%. It\u2019s inline with obviously your kind of closing guidance for fiscal \u201915. But if you kind of go through the mechanics of how you get to that number with your local operators I think that will be helpful in terms of the assumptions and kind of puts and close you put into the process. David Auld :  Well David, I kind of always keep saying this and it gets monotonous but it really does come down to specific demand or expected demand within a community within a sub-market within a division and we build these models for these programs based on our position in that community and what kind of demand or absorption we think it will give us at the margin we want to make. And so from a very simplistic standpoint and it varies throughout the year but we generally like to have about three months of sales at three various stages of inventory coming out of the ground.  So if it\u2019s a community doing till a month that will be carrying six packs in that community, two completed, two at frame and two at slab. And then sale into that inventory, supplement sales with build out. As you go community by community and add it all up that\u2019s how we get to the numbers we get into. David Goldberg - UBS: That\u2019s very helpful and just as a follow-up question I was wondering if you can talk about the kind of leverage you are seeing in land, on the land acquisition side and what we should expect as you move to more Express series land purchases? I would assume there is little more financial leverage, little bit easier to option that land. So maybe you could talk about kind of what are seeing in the market and what you think that means for the balance sheet as the [patio] shift a little bit more towards Express is that going to be more free cash flow generative as you move forward, less free cash flow intensive, I guess how we think about it? David Auld :  I think on the leverage side I mean when there was nobody out there developing lots we -- and there were finished lots on the ground, that we could buy at very advantageous prices we ended with a lot of owned lots and one of the prior questions was about focus. One of the things that I think we need to do is move back to our historical 50-50 owned versus option plots and as developers are coming back into the market, one of our primary objective is to maintain develop, maintain and support those relationships. So that we have people to delivering lots in front of us and the high absorption communities, the high absorption model of Express it is a perfect place to get some body in front of us doing it. Jessica Hansen :  David, we are pretty much down on the 50-50 on our finished lot position and we have made good progress on our overall owned position but we are still not there. We\u2019re about 68% owned, 32% options so we are headed in the right direction to get to that 50-50 split that David mentioned. Michael Murray : We have got some good development partners out there and we are going to try to grow this relationships and strengthen them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Roxland from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Michael Roxland - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on your new role David. David Auld :  Thank you, Mike. Michael Roxland - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Can you just talk about some of the progress you have made on improving your construction efficiency with respect to the Emerald brand. Obviously that\u2019s a new brand for you guys and you have experienced, I think from growing pains with the product and just wanted to see where you are in the learning curve and how the efficiency in terms of the construction has improved let\u2019s say quarter over the last couple of quarters? David Auld : I think we are learning that buyer and that market and adjusting different processes and procedures to meet the expectations that, that buyer has and I think our original, some of the original product we put out we probably were building more for ourselves than for the customer and we are adjusting that and really just drilling down and putting into the houses what that buyer really wants. And I guess it\u2019s going to create efficiency and improve our overall performance of the brand. Michael Murray : Specifically Mike we haven\u2019t measured the -- we don\u2019t have in front of us the production turn times for each by brand. So we really can\u2019t comment any specific changes this quarter versus last. Michael Roxland - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Got you. But just suffice to say have you seen an improvement in the margins that you are generating from that product relative to a couple of quarters ago? David Auld :  Yes we have. Yes, as we drill down and understand what that buyer wants we are generating higher margins. Michael Roxland - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Got you. And then just last question, you mentioned that your incentives were flat quarter-over-quarter. I think in last quarter you mentioned that you weren\u2019t happy with the absorption pace as you raise your incentive levels. Is it fair to say now that you are happy with the absorptions that you are seeing on an aggregate basis and that if these continue there is no need for you to discount any further because you are happy with the sales pace overall? David Auld : We are on plan meeting our absorption targets. So yes we are happy with where we are right now and so that\u2019s\u2026 Bill Wheat : Yes in total we are certainly pleased with where we are and what we are seeing overall but again we don\u2019t necessarily manage it at a global level. We\u2019re going to manage at each community. So we have some communities where we may be cutting back on incentives because we are exceeding our absorption targets, some might be right on track, some might be a little short. So we are going to increase incentives. So but in total absolutely a 38% increase we feel like the aggregate result is definitely in line with where we want to be. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : Good morning. David Auld : Good morning. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : In terms of input cost just curious if you could talk a little bit about the trended land cost where we are as you are working through your inventory, if that is something that\u2019s changing meaningfully? And then also your assumptions in terms of building components and what trends happened there? And then eventually curious on how you think about that how that is matching up with your average selling price expectation for 2015? Jessica Hansen : Sure Eric. Our land cost has remained relatively flat as a component of the overall cost going into our house. We called out some of the other things that did impact our margin this quarter but land remained relatively flat. Bill Wheat : And in terms of the other input cost on a year-over-year basis we have seen some cost pressures, our stick and brick cost on a per square foot basis were up about 5%. On a year-over-year basis, sequentially they are up about 2%. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : As you think about those factors into \u201915, a year where I think you talked about no real expected change in ASP, some of that a function of mix how do you think about that balance between those factors? David Auld : I think the mix is probably the biggest driver of the flat average sales price. We do and are experiencing pricing power in a lot of our markets. Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company : Steady as she goes. David Auld : Yes, consistency is I guess is kind of a right now, we are seeing a lot of consistency on the market at the subdivision level, at the division level and I think it\u2019s going to be a good year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks and congratulations to David and Mike on your new roles. David Auld : Thank you, Nishu. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank : I wanted to ask first about the October sales trends, obviously a strong number, 20% plus in the context of what we have been seeing from just the industry in general but somewhat of a slowdown from the pace in the September quarter. How should we think about that I mean obviously going into year-end I imagine there is a real push. So is that just month-to-month volatility maybe around the year end or have you seen some slow down into October? Jessica Hansen : Nishu that shows that we get for given more than we normally do on a monthly basis. But we wanted to give a little bit of color but as we always have said a month does not make a quarter. So we're letting you know that our October sale phase was strong and we feel good with what we've seen thus far even though we're only 11 days into November and greater than 20% in October. As David said earlier we're on plan to deliver what is in our business plan and you'll have to wait till January to see what we deliver for the quarter. Michael Murray : I wouldn't read anything special into whether we accelerated or decelerated in October. I think in general we would still say it's a very good sales environment, still a very good sales month for us. 20% was the floor. David Auld : Nishu, we're looking for consistency, month to month. Nishu Sood \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay and second question the 20% return on inventory metric, the pretax income divided by the average investment in the community over the life of it. That sounds like a local at the divisional level. So I imagine that's not fully loaded with the entire expense structure. So my question is how would we translate that number to the overall D.R. Horton corporate level and how -- what is your target for that number? I mean let's say that 20% translates to, I don't know to 15ish%, what's your target and when would you expect to get there? Bill Wheat : Nishu, first of all definitionally that 20% is a fully loaded number at that community level. So we look at our project pro formas and performances on a fully burdened basis to drive that 20% average pre-tax return on the inventory investment in that community. So that will translate up as a goal to the total. Obviously we're not there yet. We\u2019re little over 11% on a consolidated basis, including any impairments we've taken but to get all the way to 20% on a consolidated basis, I don't have a timeline for when it's going to be there? But that is what we're pushing the bar too and that's what we're measuring ourselves against internally. David Auld : Steady consistent improvement in the ROI is the goal when we feel like it's we're doing the things today that should achieve steady improvement. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks. Wanted to ask just as a point of reference if we go back to the mix of communities, thinking about the absorption, could you give us a sense of just how much of a difference in absorption there is between Express, Horton, and Emerald? Michael Murray : Yeah, in general Mike our Express communities on absorption basis is about double our company average ball park, which is kind of inline with where our expectations would be and then Emerald is certainly lower than our company average but obviously the dollars per home is much greater. Michael Dahl - Credit Suisse : Got it and then I guess on a related topic, than if we think about the margin guide for next year, 19.5% to 20.5%, is that - I mean I guess what's the biggest delta and I guess you did mention it could be higher or lower than that range quarter-to-quarter, what's the biggest driver that you think of that could push it to either the low end or the high end based on what you're seeing today. David Auld : I think the fit to low end would be a change in market conditions where right now we've been experiencing stability in the market and slight improvement kind of month-to-month quarter-to-quarter. We had a reset on values at spring which we responded to with additional incentives. But since that we're operating kind of on flat waters right now. Michael Murray : And then absent a change in market conditions I really feel the product mix changes as we roll out Express, primarily is the wild card in terms of exactly how that translates to margins quarter-to-quarter is probably the biggest driver and is assuming the market stays stable. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: Yes, hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can provide some color on what you are seeing in the market, if you are seeing less competition for land parcels, if there is any geographic color on what you find most attractive and maybe just the average size of new deals you are looking at. David Auld : Well competition in the market is always there. We had a very [brief of] opportunity in 2011 and \u201912, really we were the only ones buying. But since then everybody is back. Right now we are pretty much in a replacement mode mark-to-market. The markets that are generating high levels of sales is where we are putting most of the dollars. And I don\u2019t remember the third part of the question. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Average size maybe in terms of number of lots? David Auld :  Typically we underwrite to a two year cash back program. So it depends on the absorption that we should be generating out of that on an average. So it\u2019s 50 to 100 lots probably. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods:  Great, thanks. Just secondly, a follow-up on the mix of buyer profiles and I apologize if you gave this earlier in the quarter but do you have the mix of orders, your first and first time move up? Jessica Hansen :  Sure, Jade and we only have that data from the buyers that use our mortgage company which is about 50% of our buyers this quarter roughly and we were at 39% first time homebuyers for the quarter. Operator :  Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners :  Good morning, thanks. I guess most of my questions have been answered but did want to ask as a follow-up to that last question any thoughts on the recent news from the FHFA and as a follow-up to that, I know it\u2019s hard to some times to get data on those who didn\u2019t come through the system but any sense of what\u2019s the bigger issue for your buyer, is it down payment typically or is it you know more a DTI issue? Thanks. David Auld :  In terms of the FHA, FHA clearly there is a lot of talk going on in terms of our assumption as we look at our business. We are not assuming any change in the mortgage environment, just the same current mortgage lending standards. Any changes going forward we will deal with those as they come. Jessica Hansen :  In terms of the biggest issue Megan really anything we tell you is going to primarily anecdotal but we do hear DTI is one of the bigger categories that our buyers struggle with today which is why Express we feel has been very positive for us. We can\u2019t control our buyers debt level but we can control the sales price of the houses we are selling and so if we can help with that piece of the debt to income metric we have seen a lot of success on that front. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners :  Great, thanks helpful. And I guess just as a follow-up on the balance sheet and capital allocation it feels like going through this earnings season we have seen a bit of a higher level of announcements around share buyback from homebuilders. Certainly with your announcement on expect to share count, it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s something that you are looking at but maybe give your thoughts on why it\u2019s something that you don\u2019t feel is something you want to pursue? David Auld :  Right now we still see tremendous opportunities to invest in our business. We are generating improving returns. We are seeing the opportunity to grow at an improving return. So right now that is our highest priority. We would never rule out buybacks at some point in the future but right now we still see great opportunities in our business. Operator :  Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. Alex Barron - Housing Research Center :  Thanks and good morning and congratulations on the quarter and everybody in their new roles. David Auld :  Thank you, Alex. Alex Barron - Housing Research Center :  I wanted to focus a little bit on Express I am sorry if you already covered it and I missed it. But I think you said that deliveries -- or the orders were 10% and the deliveries were l believe 7%. How do you guys see the what percentage are you guys kind of thinking or aiming at for 2015 and also what kind of sales rates, I guess are you guys thinking or experiencing so far in Express and last question on Express how many communities do you have currently and how many do you expect to have by the end of next year? Jessica Hansen :  Sure, Alex. As we said for the quarter that Express is 10% of our home sales and 6% of our closing. For the full fiscal year it was 7% of our home sales and 5% of our closings and we don\u2019t have any set targets for where that\u2019s going to go in fiscal 2015 but we would continue to expect we would continue to expect to ramp-up our community openings in \u201915 and have the sales and closings follow. We have talked about over the next few years we think Express could be everywhere from 25% to 30% of our unit. Alex Barron - Housing Research Center :  And do you guys track the number of [new home] buyers that you have seen so far in this quarter or this year? Jessica Hansen :  We don\u2019t, Alex. Alex Barron - Housing Research Center :  But do you expect that to be a meaningful size of your buyers I guess through the Express range? David Auld :  You know that certainly possible Alex and certainly where we are on the calendar there is more of those that have the potential to come back in to the market but that\u2019s not something we are specifically targeting necessarily. Operator :  Thank you. We\u2019ve reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. Thank you everybody. Operator :  Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; We are off to a great start in 2015 and are looking forward to the spring. In the first quarter, our homes sold and closed increased by 35% and 29% respectively, and we had another solid quarter of profitability with $220.7 million of pretax income on $2.3 billion of revenue. Demand for new homes remains stable across most of our markets during this quarter, and consistent with normal seasonality our weekly sales pace has accelerated in January. We are in a strong competitive position for the upcoming spring sales season with a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes. For our full year in 2015, we expect to generate a 20% to 30% increase in revenues with similar levels of profitability and operating margins as we share on our last call. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to generate double digit growth in both revenues and pretax profits, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. Mike? Michael Murray : Net income for the first quarter increased 16% to $142.5 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $123.2 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased 16% to $220.7 million in the first quarter compared to $189.7 million in the year ago quarter, and homebuilding pretax income increased 13% to $206.1 million compared to $181.9 million in the prior year quarter. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 37% to $2.2 billion on 7,973 homes closed, up from $1.6 billion on 6,188 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $281,000, up 7% compared to the prior year primarily driven by a 4% in our average home size and a small increase in our average sales price per square foot. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 40% from a year ago quarter to $2.1 billion, and homes sold increased 35% to 7,370 homes on a 6% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales prices on net sales orders in the first quarter increased 4% to $286,100. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 24%, relatively stable compared to 23% in the year ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 29% from a year ago to $2.7 billion with an average sales price per home of $293,600, and homes in backlog increased 21% to 9,285 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was higher than our expectations at 81%. We expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 81% to 85%. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : We are experiencing strong growth and profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of the rollouts of our Express Homes and Emerald Homes brands. Our Express Homes brand, which is targeted at the true entry level buyer focused primarily on affordability, is now being offered in 38 markets and 11 states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas, the Carolinas, and Florida. This quarter, Express accounted for 13% of our homes sold, 10% of homes closed, and 6% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express Home in the first quarter was $169,000. Customer response to our affordable Express product offerings has been extremely positive, and we expect to have Express Homes communities open in the substantial majority of our markets by the end of this fiscal 2015. Emerald Homes, our brand for higher end move up and luxury communities is available in 35 markets across 15 states. In the first quarter, 7% of our homes closed were priced greater than $500,000, accounting for 17% of our home sales revenue, up from 5% of homes closed, and 14% of revenues in the same quarter last year. Mike? Michael Murray : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 19.8%, in the middle of the expected range we shared on our last call. This was a 70 basis points sequential decline from the fourth quarter, 80 basis points of the margin decrease was due to cost increases in excess of sales price increases and changes in product mix, and 10 basis points was due to slightly higher relative cost for warranty and construction defect claims. These margin decreases were partially offset by a 20 basis point improvement related to less impact from purchase accounting for acquisitions.  Our general gross margin expectations for fiscal 2015 remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter. With the strong performance of our Express Community so far, we continue to expect this brand to grow quickly as a percentage of our product mix helping us generate strong growth in both revenues and profits, but bringing our average gross margin percentage down this year. In the current stable housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margins to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that can range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and their relative impact of warranty, litigation, and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. Bill? Bill Wheat : Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $238 million compared to $183.4 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues, our SG&A improved 60 basis points to 10.6% compared to 11.2% in the prior year quarter as our significant revenue increase this quarter improved our SG&A leverage. For the second quarter, we expect our SG&A as a percentage of home sales revenues to improve year-over-year by 30 to 50 basis points to the range of 10.6% to 10.8%. We expect our third and fourth quarter SG&A percentage to trend down sequentially from the second quarter on higher expected volumes. Our ongoing annual target for SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues is 10%. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services\u2019 pretax income in the first quarter increased 87% to $14.6 million from $7.8 million in the year ago quarter. 89% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our home building operations. FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage companies\u2019 volume, down from 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 717 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. David? David Auld : At the end of December, we had 21,300 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 12,400 were spec homes, and 4,500 of the specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $178 million during the quarter as we prepare for seasonally higher demand in the spring. Our first quarter investment in lots, land, and development totaled $564 million, of which $309 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $255 million was for land development. At December 31, 2014 our lot portfolio consisted of 125,000 owned lots with an additional 60,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 71,000 of our lots are finished 33,000 are owned and 38,000 are optioned. Our 185,000 total lots owned and controlled put us in a strong competitive position in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support strong growth in sales and closings in future periods. As we invest in new communities for all three of our brands our main underwriting criteria remains unchanged. A minimum annual pretax return on inventory of 20% defined as pre-tax income divided by average inventory over the life of the community. We expect each community regardless of brand to achieve this target by optimizing the balance between absorptions, margins and inventory levels. We expect our total home building pretax return on inventory to improve this year as compared to last year. Mike? Michael Murray : During the first quarter we recorded $2.2 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence cost for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $3.8 million of inventory impairment charges related to a pending land sale in our west region. Our inactive land held for development of $304.3 million at the end of the quarter represents 13,900 loss, down slightly from September and down 36% from a year ago. We are proactively working through these older unproductive assets to redeploy the capital, and improve the cash flows and returns. We continue to formulate our operating plans for each of our remaining inactive land parcels and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline this fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate our inactive land parcels for potential impairments which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Bill? Bill Wheat : At December 31st our homebuilding liquidity included $517.7 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $506 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had $375 million of cash borrowings and $94 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 39.3% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 35.4%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3 billion. Our only public debt maturity in fiscal 2015 is our $158 million of Senior Notes due in February. At December 31, our shareholders equity balance was $5.3 billion and book value per share was $14.40, up 11% from a year ago. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our expectations for the fiscal year which are unchanged from our last call and based on the current stable housing market conditions. In fiscal 2015, we continue to expect to close between 34,500 and 37,500 homes and generate consolidated revenues of between $9.5 billion and $10.5 billion. We also continue to expect to generate a similar level of profitability and operating margins is what we shared on our last call. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2015 will range from 19.5% to 20.5% with potential quarterly fluctuation outside of this range. We estimate our homebuilding SG&A expense will range from 10% to 10.3% of homebuilding revenues for the full year with our next quarter being higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters at the low end or below the annual range. We expect our financial services operating margin to range from 25% to 30%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2015 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36% and our diluted share count to be approximately 370 million shares. For our second fiscal quarter of 2015 we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate of between 81% and 85%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 19.5% to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix, warranty and interest cost. We expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 10.6% to 10.8% of revenues, David? David Auld : In closing our first quarter growth in sales, closings and profits in a relatively stable market is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about the spring selling season and the opportunities ahead. This quarter, the value of our sales and closings increased by 40% and 37% respectively and we generated another solid quarter of profitability with a consolidated pretax income of $220.7 million on $2.3 billion of revenue. We remain focussed on growing both our revenues and pretax profits at a double digit pace, while improving our cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our three brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our tremendous operational team across the country. We\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations during 2015. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is coming from David Goldberg of UBS. Please go ahead. David Goldberg : Thanks, good morning everybody and congratulations on a great quarter. David Auld : Thank you, David. David Goldberg : My first question was on competitive behaviour. We've been hearing about more and more builders talking about incentives increasing, obviously you guys haven't had to change your gross margin forecast. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what you're hearing from the field. Are you hearing buyers are coming and asking for more incentives and you're just not willing to be flexible that way, or is the value proposition such that you think you already have a more competitive product essentially? David Auld : David, this is David Auld. I think we have been focussing on the value proposition really since last spring, and we just -- because of our broad footprint, number of communities we have, we are just not seeing the same pressure at any one location that some of the other guys are. Bill Wheat : And just specifically David, our incentive levels are in the same range that we have seen really since last spring. It\u2019s obviously that sort of community by community levels, so we see some variation there, but in general, we\u2019re hitting our absorption targets pretty consistently and therefore, at a high level we are not seeing any big changes in incentive levels. David Goldberg : Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think everybody would love to get some color on the markets in Texas, obviously you guys have a very big position, there's a lot of concern given what's going on with oil, maybe you can just kind of give us some on the ground, I know you said January sales and traffic were up sequentially as would expect, generally, but maybe focus in on the markets in Texas and how you're seeing them move here, if we're seeing any pause from the buyers, would be helpful. Thank you. Michael Murray : Hi David, this is Mike. We saw our Texas operations perform in line with the company and our expectations for the first quarter and into the first few weeks of January so far. So, while we would expect that there could be some general slowdown in Texas at some point, specifically perhaps Houston and Midland, we haven\u2019t exactly seen it yet, and we\u2019re very encouraged seeing the results inline with the expectations right now. David Goldberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Stephen East of Evercore. Please go ahead. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just following on Texas, since we get so many questions about it, have you changed what you're doing on land deals? What type of contingency planning are you going through, and again, I understand primarily Houston, but I would love your opinions about how much you think the other markets would ultimately be impacted versus what Houston would be impacted. David Auld : Stephen, this is David. Obviously Houston and Midland are going to have a tougher time if oil prices stay down than the balance of the markets and Texas. All of them will be impacted. From an investment standpoint, we are well positioned in Texas. We don\u2019t have to go out today and take a lot of risk on the land side as the competition from other builders decreases even if the market stays relatively strong, you know price tomorrow just on rumor and innuendo is probably going to be less than it is today. So we are in the market, we are going to continue to be in the market, but we are not in a place today where we have to go buy anything, so we are going to take a more conservative approach than what you have seen in the last couple of years. Bill Wheat : And Stephen, this Bill, just to add some specifics to Houston and Midland, our fiscal 2014 revenues in Houston were about 5% of the company and our fiscal 2014 revenues in Midland were less than 1%, so it is certainly compared to the rest of the company relatively small piece, but as you know we manage our business market by market, so we are treating these markets and while we are seeing there individually, we\u2019ll adjust our investment decisions by what we see in those markets. Stephen East : Okay. Fair enough. And then sort of a two-part, one southwest and west strong order growth just trying to understand where that's occurring and why it's occurring. And then David, you're sort of finishing your first hundred days, if you will, I would love to get your thoughts about what you're seeing maybe it\u2019s a little bit different than your expectations, maybe a direction you'd like to move the company a little bit more or a little bit less, just sort of an initial hundred day wrap-up if you would. David Auld : I can tell you from the 100 day perspective; I\u2019ve been a part of this management team for 25 years. There were no surprises coming up here, the difference in operational philosophy were we just continued to drive down subdivision by subdivision by subdivision, house by house. That\u2019s been a part of our program for a long time. I\u2019ll probably provide a little more focus on that or conversation with our operators about it, but it\u2019s always been there. Stephen East : Okay, fair enough. Bill Wheat : Stephen, this is Bill, you asked about the west and the southwest, obviously the west is a bigger region for us. We have some very good positions in our western markets, and we\u2019re seeing, we have seen pretty good strength in the market there through December, and so we feel like that\u2019s reflecting in our sales growth that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call out one market in particular. Southwest is pretty small for us, it\u2019s basically Arizona, New Mexico, and obviously there\u2019s been a lot of volatility there over the last couple of years, and so you\u2019re seeing a nice increase this quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t read too much into our southwest results given its size. Jessica Hansen : The changes you are seeing, Stephen, though are truly being driven by absorption, which is what we are pretty excited about that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focussed on for quite some time now, and with our active selling communities only up about 6% on a year-over-year basis for the entire company and you saw a very strong pick up in our absorption pace this quarter. Stephen East : Okay, thanks and congratulations on a nice quarter. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Collin [ph] filling in for Bob actually. I just had a question on ASP, you guys saw a pretty solid increase in ASP year-over-year. How do you think this pricing is going to trend throughout the year sequentially? David Auld : Collin [ph] we are kind of projecting ASPs to be flat sort of hard to really predict given the changing mix that we are seeing with Express representing a larger proportion of our sales and deliveries, but we are looking for a flat sales price outlook for the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Stephen Kim from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys, yeah congratulations good job executing. I wanted to ask you a question about costs. And as we've been talking to folks in the industry, we've kind of gotten some I would say, we haven't really gotten a lot of agreement about the ability to extract some concessions from your subcontractors, your suppliers etcetera. Was wondering if you, given your significant gap that you created here between you all and number two, whether you're seeing more success in driving down your input costs, whether it be across labor or materials or really anything, if you could call out something that would be very helpful. Thanks. Bill Wheat : Yes, Stephen this is Bill. You know that\u2019s something we are still working to kind of trying to find the balance on. If we look year-over-year this on our closings this quarter, our stick and brick cost still increased on a per square foot basis about 6% and our revenues were only up 3%. So we still got some work to do there, we\u2019ve seen that trend over the last few quarters and that\u2019s something we are very focussed on. And in terms of improving our cost relative to our ability to raise our prices. There is certainly there are always things that we can do with our scale, market by market and globally there are national arrangements and we can assure you that that\u2019s something that we are very focussed on throughout our organization as to even out that relationship and stabilize that going forward, so we can improve our margins. As far as specific matters, it\u2019s across the gamut [ph] in different categories, you know with oil prices down we have the potential of seeing some benefit on some categories like shingles and things that have petroleum products in them, but I would tell you we are just focussed on anything we can do across the board to improve our improve our cost structure. Stephen Kim : Got it, okay so it\u2019s a little early still but still hopeful. Bill Wheat : Absolutely. Stephen Kim : I wanted to also than follow up if I could a little bit on the other half of the margin equation, which is your price. So obviously you put up a very good order number here as we expected you to. You are continuing to obviously gain a lot of share. But you also mentioned you\u2019re your pretty much your absorption rates were, I think you said in line with your targets. And I guess, I'm trying to figure out whether or not the order growth that you achieved in the quarter, and are achieving generally, is enough for you to perhaps think you might have more opportunity on a pricing side, to get a little more aggressive with pricing. Because from your commentary it didn't sound like -- you maintained your guidance on margins and things like that. Do you think that you do have the ability to push pricing more than you have been, given what you've seen so far in the spring selling season? Bill Wheat : Stephen its way too early in the spring selling season to really hand out that kind of message, we are happy with where we are. We feel like if it continues, if the market is a good market to this spring, then yes, we will try to push margins. But based upon where we are today it\u2019s just not something we can put out there. Stephen Kim : Okay. Bill Wheat : Stephen, as we talked about our goal is to increase efficiencies and at a community by community level and that means, taking the communities to the planned pace that we want for each community. Pace then begets good momentum, positive momentum to given community and certainly as David said its early spring. Spring is not even really here yet. But we\u2019re in line with our expectations and we would expect that we\u2019re going to get every margin of dollar that every dollar of margin we can as we move to the spring and as our pace and absorptions stay on track. Stephen Kim : Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. Good Job. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Ken Zener : Gentlemen, Jessica. Bill Wheat : Good morning. Jessica Hansen : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zener : Several items I just like to clarify and get a little feedback on. So, your sales pace rose sequentially it seems, is that normal seasonality to you or was there really just a step function in the absorptions that as we move into the second quarter and third quarter we\u2019ll have more normal seasonality? Jessica Hansen : Ken, we actually saw our active selling communities on average trend down a little bit, so you\u2019re right our increase in absorption was up, say, call it low to mid single-digit. That\u2019s actually pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. Bill Wheat : Right. Jessica Hansen : So, nothing out of line. What\u2019s more important which I think is what you\u2019re getting at, is the pickups that we\u2019ll see from December and March, and we\u2019ll be very focused on driving that increase in absorption and making sure that we\u2019re hitting that normal seasonal trends. Ken Zener : So, to get to that and realizing you guys aren\u2019t necessarily going to give guidance, but historical over the last let\u2019s say 15 years you usually had December pace decelerate to 15% to 18% from September? And then usually you picked up around 50%, 55% in the March quarter, while the December pace is now different slightly. Do you think the March pace, is there any reason that that would accelerate or decelerate versus that kind of 50% rate that we\u2019ve seen historically? David Auld : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we would say that December would read into March. Obviously with improved pace in December we would feel very good if we see our normal 50% increase into the March quarter. Ken Zener : Okay. And then I guess last question around Express, given that you\u2019re looking for flat pricing this year, you\u2019re costs are kind of still up. You\u2019re obviously executing well in terms of understand how your gross margins are trending. Do you think \u2013 this is a bigger question, but if you\u2019re getting more mix from you Express product? Would it surprise you if 2016 if your price mix was actually down, its not necessarily a bad think obviously if your pace is up at the rate that you\u2019re going, but would that surprise you? David Auld : I don\u2019t like we\u2019d be surprise, because there\u2019s a lot less competition at that price point, and it\u2019s going to drive, its continuing to drive month over month, quarter over quarter increases. Bill Wheat : Yes. Ken, I think we would agree with you. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s not a bad thing at all, if our average sales price were to go down because our Express mix has grown. And that\u2019s really part of what\u2019s behind our expectations for our average selling price to be roughly flat this year. Obviously we still saw an increase in Q1, but our expectation was roughly flat because we do expect Express to grow as a percentage of our business this year. And while we may see appreciation in some markets are mixed toward Express may offset that somewhat. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Eli Hackel of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eli Hackel : Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on Express but a little differently, obviously you\u2019re rolling it out throughout your markets now. I\u2019m just curious is sort of what happens when you roll it out sort of the buyer types that are coming. Are these people that have been trying to buy a home for year or two and just there hasn\u2019t been anything in their price point and there\u2019s sort of jus a flood of buyers that come and they\u2019re happy there\u2019s something finally that they can afford. I\u2019m curious about sort of what happens as you enter markets and who\u2019s showing up at the door? Michael Murray : Hi, Eli, this is Mike. I think you have hit it pretty well. I think that\u2019s been an underserved market segment and that they\u2019re getting a new home product at a very affordable price is an alternative they haven\u2019t had. That combined with some general strengthen in the economy over the past few years and in some job numbers working together to provide that product has been a good outcome for us quite frankly. Eli Hackel : Great. Okay. Thanks. And then just little direct \u2013 different direction. You talked earlier about increasing cash flows. What type of return \u2013 what type of horizon are you thinking about the cash flows sort of going from negative to positive and you could just talk about preference in order and use of cash when it does do that flip? Thanks. Bill Wheat : Eli, this is Bill. We\u2019ve talked about fiscal 2015 being the point in which we kind of hit an inflection at a roughly breakeven level for cash. We could be slightly positive, slightly negative that will largely be determined based on what we see in the market in the spring and whether that affects our investment decisions in inventory, but then our expectation is then moving into fiscal 2016 that we should general solid positive cash flows. We\u2019ve talked quite a bit about the fact that our land supply is at an adequate level and should support growth in sales and closings in the revenue in the next couple of years without really needing to increase that land supply. And we think that\u2019s going to be a big driver towards getting us to a positive cash flow position. What we will do with it when we get to that point is really, we\u2019ll make that decision when we get there. Today we\u2019re still seeing very strong opportunities in our business to continue invest in strong markets and so that to the extend we see strong opportunities to reinvest in the business that will continue to be our number one priority. Beyond that we\u2019ve continue to be a consistent dividend payer and we\u2019ll always look at our dept levels and to the extent that we feel like it\u2019s most appropriate for us to reduce and we will look at that as well. Eli Hackel : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Just follow-up on Express, just curious as you continue to roll these homes out and have success. How things evolving with the strategy especially as you move into the other markets just thinking if there\u2019s anything different on price points or features, anything that you can do to improve the margin profile, just give us a little bit of an update if you could on how the product is evolving? David Auld : Well, as you rolled out a new product you gain efficiencies every time your build. And we are also giving a better definition of who is buying. Why they are buying. And targeting what we\u2019re building, what we\u2019re putting in to that buyer. So, the general belief is over time we\u2019ll get add it and we\u2019ll make more money delivering it. Bill Wheat : And thus far express while the average margin is below the company average. I think we would in general say that margins have been a little better than our original expectations on Express. Still below the average and as we execute and roll it out I think there is definitely will be opportunities to improve on that. Eric Bosshard : Great. And then, that\u2019s helpful. Secondly, in terms of land costs, if you give us some perspective on the cost of land that you\u2019re using and expect to use over the next year, if there\u2019s any meaningful change in the margin opportunity or the pricing requirements associated with the inflation that\u2019s taking place in your basic land? Bill Wheat : No, doubt, our land costs are a components that we do expect to increase. We have seen our land as a percentage of our overall revenues or on a per square foot basis, similar to how it look at stick and brick. It has increase as well on a year-over-year basis, it\u2019s up about 6%. And as we work through some of the communities that where we bought the lots and land in 2011 and 2012 and began to work through more of the ones we purchased in 2013 and 2014. We would expect that to increase somewhat. But that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re certainly focused on and as we look at our expectations for pricing and demand in our markets going forward we certainly focus on trying to only pay what we can afford to hit our margins and return objectives going forward. Eric Bosshard : Does the up 6% is that kind of sustain that where it should be your \u2013 as you work in more of a 2013, 2014 land, is that still up a little bit that 6% number? Bill Wheat : That\u2019s on per square foot basis, and that\u2019s where things have been just recently. Would not be surprise for that to continue to move upward a bit as we move through 2015. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Will Randow of Citi. Please go ahead. Will Randow : Hey, good morning and congratulations. David Auld : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks Will. Will Randow : As you guys think about buying land today, I want to get a sense of what are assuming for ASP inflation if you will, I\u2019m assuming low single digit, I know you\u2019re not looking for inflation in your numbers and I would assume that land has actually become a bit cheaper as a percentage of called it home sales revenue for the last call it six months versus 2013 where we can have that double, but love to get your views on that? David Auld : From price of a lot to the selling price of the house, we haven\u2019t seen a decline over 2013 primarily I think because what we\u2019ve delivered in 2013 we bought in 2012. Bill Wheat : As we look forward will underwrite a land purchase, we assume flat pricing on the homes as well as flat pricing on the cost develop if it\u2019s a land parcel to be developed as well and stick and brick. It just too hard to start predicting, this is going to go up by this percent, these costs to go up by that percent. It\u2019s much for us controllable underwriting process to look at pricing on a flat basis and then understand what that performance we expected to be to make the investment decision. Will Randow : And in terms of regional exposure it seems like the southeast firing pretty strong particular, Atlanta where you\u2019ve done a recent acquisition. I guess what\u2019s been your strongest market and your weakest and where have been surprised? Thanks. David Auld : I mean, we\u2019ve done. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve been surprised. We\u2019ve made a conscious decision to push assets to the East, Southeast particularly. We like the just the demographics and the growth trends and the job growth there. Texas has been strong despite the softening of oil. Texas is going to remain strong at least in my opinion. Bill Wheat : I think our investments we\u2019ve made in the last couple years in terms we look at the inventory growth by region you\u2019re now seeing that deliver in our results especially on the Southeastern and South Central. Will Randow : Appreciate the color, and congrats again. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mike Dahl with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Dahl : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to follow-up on I guess the Texas comment for tying [ph] in Express. If we look at the growth in Express, seems like its accounted for about half of the overall growth in unit orders for the company, presumably it\u2019s a bit higher in Texas, so just wondering how your thinking. Would unit Express still be up in Texas? Just trying to think about how many of these comments are for in specific versus the market? Bill Wheat : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt that our units would still up in Texas without Express or Express is certainly is a key part of our rollout right now at Texas and in other markets. But I think there is some Company\u2019s specific factors with respect to D.R. Horton in Texas versus what you may hear from some other builders, obviously we\u2019re based in Texas we\u2019ve had a strong position in Texas historically and we have a strong operating platform there that\u2019s allowing us to execute in the current market and we believe would allow us to execute very effectively if the market changes. It has historically and we believe that that we\u2019re in good position to handle whatever the market may bring to us coming forward. Mike Dahl : Got it. Thanks. And shifting gears, I guess, curious your thoughts on the FHA premium issue, you given the 42% FHA, VA and how your sales people are thinking about this? Is this something where that buyer is even aware of the change in premiums yet or is it a tool that you have your sales people needing to educate buyers and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any initial response from that? Thanks. Jessica Hansen : Yes, Mike, it\u2019s definitely a tool for our sales people and something that they\u2019re already out there talking to our potential home buyers about. I think some people do come in educated just because that makes a lot of headlines when there are changes on that front. And then there are some people who probably come in that are little less educated. But our salespeople, but our sales people already have flyers out and about letting people know about the change and we\u2019re definitely using that to our advantage from a marketing perspective, a little too early to know what kind of impact that could have, but clearly any incremental easing, in this case lowering of insurance premiums we would look at as a positive. David Auld : And whether that they are educated about exactly what it means or don\u2019t \u2013 exactly what it means, it has people taking about buying a house and that\u2019s always a good thing for us. Mike Dahl : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nishu Sood : Thanks. Wanted to follow-up discussion about the gross margins. It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a kind of normal year from a seasonal flow perspective, so if we do end up with that this year stable pricing, incentives et cetera and closings volume rising throughout your fiscal year. Would we expect to see the normal gross margin leverage on fixed cost and therefore some increase this year goes on? Bill Wheat : Nishu, we really don\u2019t have any significant fixed costs in our gross margin at all, virtually all of our costs are associated in a variable within our margin. So we really don\u2019t see that leverage with volume across our year. We do on the SG&A side, because obviously there\u2019s a fixed component to SG&A, but there is not in terms of margin. What you would see if we see the normal lift and we see consistency through the market that may allow us in our communities to adjust pricing which certainly could help, but no, we don\u2019t expect anything seasonally from a leverage of fixed cost to help our margins. We\u2019re guiding to a range of 19.5% to 20.5% could have some potential quarterly fluctuations there. And right now three weeks into January really the spring and what we see in the market in the spring is going to determine the trajectory of our margins going forward for the rest of the year. Nishu Sood : Got it. And that\u2019s very helpful. And second question I wanted to ask about the January comments you made. So I know it\u2019s obviously a difficult time of year to assess trends. But given the strong demand that\u2019s you been seeing, any kind of anecdotal indicators you\u2019ve seen to help you understand where that\u2019s coming from? Is that the market? Is that the lower rate environment we\u2019ve seen? You know, gas prices, some of the mortgage stuff that has helped out or is it kind of just D.R. Horton specific? Any kind anecdotal color on that would be helpful? David Auld : I think weather patterns have been better this year and last year, I mean, we didn\u2019t gave a weather report last year, but I do think that weather impacted people\u2019s ability to get out and buy else. I think the FHA conversation has got people thinking about buying a house and going into models. The gasoline price is a huge \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s money directly back into the economy every week, I mean, there is no better way to get money into the economy and give it directly to the consumer. I think it\u2019s a combination of three things. I think we\u2019re better position this year coming out the blocks when we last year. We\u2019re excited. We got good people working hard and are well positioned to capture what we think is going to be a good spring. Nishu Sood : Okay. Great. Thank you for your color. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Adam Rudiger of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Adam Rudiger : Hi, thanks. On the heels of that question, this is kind of addressed, but I was curious if you think about your year-over-year change in orders per community how much of that you think is due to say in acquisition, say the product mix maybe incentives that you increased a little bit early in the year, just trying to get a sense of how much of this might be like kind of true organic changes in buying patterns versus as asked earlier kind of Company specific? Bill Wheat : Yes. Adam, there is just clearly a couple of things running from our acquisition of Crown communities, they are very efficient community builder, so there is a component there as well as the mix to Express. That\u2019s at a higher absorption rates, there is no doubt those are components, but with our sales increase of 35% on an average selling community increase of 6% obviously there\u2019s a lot of organic improvement as well across our organization. And I really thing that\u2019s results of us being very focused community by community and that\u2019s been an emphasis across our organization over the last year to deliver community by community hitting our absorptions, hitting our targets, staying on plan, and then adjusting inventory levels, adjusting our pricing according whether its down or up in order to make sure we stay on target to generate the best returns that we can. I really think that\u2019s that biggest factor. Adam Rudiger : Got it. Thanks. The rest of my questions have been answered. Thank you. Bill Wheat : Thanks Adam. Operator : Thank you. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, we do have to limit yourself to one and one follow-up. The next question is Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone and nice quarter. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Michael Rehaut : First question I had just to go back to the community counts absorption stats from the quarter itself. Community count year-over-year I guess flowed a little bit and you said it was down a little bit sequentially. Is that more of a one quarter phenomenon at least from a sequential standpoint given that you had sort of this consistent low double-digit growth in 2014? Would that kind of stay in mid single-digit year-over-year rate for 2015 or how should we think about that? Jessica Hansen : Yeah, Mike, what happened this quarter is pretty much exactly in line with what we shared on our last call. We talked about for the year we would anticipate our community count being up. If it\u2019s up in only a low to mid single-digit range. I think we still feel the same way about that for this quarter. We were up 6% on a year-over-year basis and we were down 2% on average sequentially. So we could see some more sequential quarters that are decreases, but we will \u2013 I mean lot of it depends on our sales pace and as always what we see in the spring, but I think we still think for the full year low to mid single digits is about as much as we would get in terms of increase in community count and we still expect the vast majority of our growth this year to come from increase and absorptions rather than communities. Michael Rehaut : Great. Now that\u2019s very helpful. And I guess just switching to the sales pace, maybe kind of a two part, with the strong improvement in 1Q and that follow the similar type of rate in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, just wanted to get a sense of if you kind of stripe out maybe the mix shift from the success of Express, what the kind of let\u2019s call the D.R. Horton branded bread and butter communities, would we see a similar type of increase or would it be more of like maybe mid-teen type of rate? That\u2019s one. And two, just a clarification on the \u2013 when you talk about accelerating sales pace in January that\u2019s typical with seasonality, I presume that if those comments were more towards seasonality that on a year-over-year basis maybe you\u2019re still seeing a similar type of absorption that you saw in 1Q? Bill Wheat : Mike, on the seasonality we are seeing January move in line with expectations. But three weeks in it\u2019s hard to call a full month and to compare year-over-year. It\u2019s kind of a short window for the comparison. We are encouraged with the January sales pace. It\u2019s meeting our expectations. But there is a seasonal lift that generally occurs this time of year as well. And then the prior question on the organic Horton sales pace growth, I mean, we are getting lift from the Express rollout. That\u2019s good, but we are also seeing strong solid growth in the Horton brands as well. Michael Rehaut : And is it mid-teens type of number, the right way to think about that, I mean, I know its maybe difficult parsing out, but clearly there\u2019s a positive mix impact from Express, so just trying to get that order of magnitude? Bill Wheat : Yeah, Mike we don\u2019t have that specifically, but clearly there\u2019s still a strong double digit growth across really all of our brands right now to nail it down to whether its 15 or whether its 20 would be a little bit difficult for us right here. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jack Micenko with SIG. Please go ahead. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just anything about mix and the absorption and the backlog conversion, are you going into spring 2015 with a greater, larger number finished specs than you did 2014? David Auld : Yes, we are and it\u2019s really ties to our expectation where the markets going to be. Jack Micenko : Okay. And can you give us some magnitude on our same-store sales basis how many more you think you have last year? Is that something you can give us? David Auld : Well, it\u2019s tied to the absorption per flag. As we have pushed up absorptions in our subdivision performance, we have increased spec levels to facilitate the next 90 days sales. Jessica Hansen : Jack, in absolute terms we\u2019re up about 1000 completed specs on a year-over-year basis. Jack Micenko : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the impairment line, knowing that it\u2019s a fluid situation and you\u2019re going to opportunistic, I guess the question is more in context. Are you going to be \u2013 should we think of 2014 on that line something closer to 2014 or something lower like the 2013 or 2012 numbers just from a volume, I think you said you have $304 million in land you look to sale or something like that, any context there? Bill Wheat : Jack, I think as we said that\u2019s kind of a opportunistic taking advantage of pulling those assets out, something that results in impairments, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Generally my gut would be that it will be little bit inside the 2014 level. Hard to exactly predict it though. Jack Micenko : Okay. That\u2019s fair. Bill Wheat : That\u2019s really project-by-project, the 304 million that\u2019s our land held for developments, some of which we may chose to bring out and build homes on. Some of which we may decide at some point to sell. What we\u2019ve seen thus far is typically the deals that we\u2019ve been to bring out and build homes on or develop and build homes. We have had very few impairments on those, as the projects that we determined that our best option is to sell in the current markets where it has been more of our impairment, so it will depend on our evaluations project-by-project. Jack Micenko : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jade Rahmani of KBW. Please go ahead. Jade Rahmani : Thank you for taking the questions. Just two small ones. What is the mix of spec sales in the quarter and can you also give the mix of first time and first time move up at your mortgage company? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Jade. In terms of our specs as a percentage of our closings this quarter it was right in the normal range we would see which was around 70% to 75% and then the mix of our products for the mortgage company, were you asking specifically about FHA and DA. Jade Rahmani : First time. Jessica Hansen : First time, I sorry, we are right around 40%, so that kind of in line with more long-term average range for us. But not surprisingly our Express percentage is running higher than the Company average. Jade Rahmani : Thank you very much for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Roxland from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Mike Roxland : Thanks very much. Congrats on a good quarter. As we begin to open communities, I think its goes back to one of Bill\u2019s comments, as you begin to open communities on the lots you purchased in 2013 and 2014, is it possible that we could see further margin compression especially if you\u2019re enable to get a better balance between rising inputs and modest price appreciation? Bill Wheat : Could you repeat some of the Mike, I\u2019m not sure we were quite following. Mike Roxland : Bill, I think you mentioned or you made a comment that you expect to see lot costs continue to obviously increase and could serve as a potential headwind for gross margin going forward. So, if you\u2019re unable to get a better balance between the rising inputs in aggregate, you obviously going to be dealing with rising inputs, higher lot costs, prices that are modestly improving. Could we see some continued gross margin compression or future gross margin compression in outer year, so maybe not call 2015, but I\u2019ll say, 2016 and beyond? David Auld : We don\u2019t have that visibility, if the market gets better, our margin will improve and the differential in land cost is not going to drive margins significantly higher or significantly lower. Bill Wheat : Yes. What we ultimately pay for land is rolling the output of where we expect the market to be when we\u2019re buying it. My comments were specific to the next few quarters in 2015 as we\u2019re working through land that we may have purchased at bit higher prices in 2013 and 2014. But clearly as the market moderated a bit in 2014, the land market while it may not have come down much, certainly isn\u2019t rising at the pace it was, so that\u2019s self adjusting at some point here. So to comment really beyond the next few quarters we really don\u2019t have that visibility. Mike Roxland : Got it, thanks for the color. And just quickly on home building SG&A came a little better than we expected, is it possible to talk about the SG&A the individual brand specifically Express and Emerald. You know given that Emerald is relatively a new market new buyer type for you, as you gain the experience in producing that product I think you actually sold a few million dollar homes in Texas the last quarter, have you been able to more effectively leverage your volume with Emerald? David Auld : Mike [ph] we don\u2019t track the SG&A by brand in one of the strategies we\u2019ve looked to do is to leverage our operational platform to serve new customer segments and so that doesn\u2019t require a repeat of all the infrastructure to support those different operations, so we haven\u2019t tried to pass out what the sort of the home building SG&A burden is to those individual brands. But I would say that as we have anniversaried and more than that the roll out of these things we have gotten better, our execution has improved. We have had some of the inefficiencies that just come along with starting something new are behind us. And so I do think that we are gaining efficiencies and certainly as the volumes increase, it helps to absorb the SG&A cost as well. Mike Roxland : Got it. Thank you for the color. Good luck -- for the balance of the year. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Mannie. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in April to share our second quarter results. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

The supplementary information includes historical data on gross margins, change in active selling community, product mix and our mortgage operation updated for this quarter\u2019s results. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The spring selling season is in full swing at D.R. Horton. During the second quarter housing market conditions were healthy and relatively stable with new home demand growing moderately across all our markets. Our sales absorption improved significantly during this quarter as our homes sold increased by 30% from a year ago on a 4% increase in active selling communities, with double-digit percentage sales increases in all three of our brands. This reflects strong performance in our core D.R. Horton communities and growth of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand, enabling us to expand our industry leading market share. Compared to the year ago quarter our number of homes sold doubled in our luxury Emerald communities and tripled in our entry level Express communities. Our homes closed increased by 33% and we delivered another solid quarter of profitability with $230.1 million in pretax income on $2.4 billion of revenue. We had a great first half of 2015 and expect the second half to be even better, with a sales backlog of 12,177 homes at March 31, and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to generate double-digit growth in both revenues and pretax profits on approving cash flows and increasing our returns. Mike? Michael Murray : Net income for the second quarter increased 13% to $147.9 million, or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $131 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the year ago quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased 14% to $230.1 million in the second quarter compared to $201.9 million in the year ago quarter and home building pretax income increased 9% to $208.6 million compared to $191.7 million in the prior year quarter. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 38% to $2.3 billion on 8,243 homes closed up from $1.7 billion on 6,194 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $281,300, up 4% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by 3% increase in our average home size. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 33% from the year ago quarter to $3.2 billion and homes sold increased 30% to 11,135 homes on a 4% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter increased 2% to $284,400. Cancellation rate for the second quarter was 20% compared to 19% in the year ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 27% from a year ago to $3.6 billion with an average sales price for homes of $293,500 and homes in backlog increased 21% to 12,177 homes.  Our backlog conversion rate for the second quarter was higher than our expectations at 89%. We expect our third quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 78% to 80%, up from 76% for third quarter of last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : We are experiencing strong growth in profitability in the heart of our business in our D.R. Horton branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We are also pleased with the progress and performance of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brand. Emerald Homes our brand for higher end move up and luxury communities is now available in 41 markets across 16 states. Our Emerald product offering has been well received by home buyers and we plan to continue expanding our footprint of higher end communities across the country. In the second quarter homes price greater than $500,000 accounted for 15% of our home sales revenue and 6% of our homes closed. Our Express homes brands, which are targeted at the true entry level buyer, focused primarily on affordability, is now being offered in 44 markets and 13 states with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas, the Carolinas and Florida.  Customer response to our affordable Express product offering has been very positive and we expect to have Express Homes communities open in a substantial majority of our markets by the end of this year. This quarter Express accounted for 18% of our homes sold, 13% of homes closed and 8% of home sales revenue. The average closing price in an Express home in the second quarter was $179,000.  We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our operating markets with all three of our brands and we plan to maintain consistent broad diversity in our product offerings over the long term. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 19.7%, down 10 basis points from the first quarter and in the middle of the expected range we shared on our last call. The consistency in our gross margin in the first two quarters reflects the stability of most of our markets today and the normalization of housing market conditions we have seen over the past year, while the increases in our average sales price have moderated as we have increased our mix of entry level product, we are raising price or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our target absorptions and we are working to control cost increases. These factors have enabled our gross margins to stabilize within our normal historical range. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged from what we shared the past several quarters. In the current stable housing environment we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that can range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs.  For the upcoming third quarter we expect our home sales gross margin will be in the range of 19.5% to 20%, consistent with the first two quarters of the year.  Mike? Michael Murray : Home building SG&A expense for the quarter was $242.4 million, compared to $187.9 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A improved 70 basis points to 10.4% compared to 11.1% in the prior year quarter as our significant revenue increase this quarter improved our SG&A leverage. Based on our projected backlog conversion we expect our SG&A as a percentage of home building revenues in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.2% which would be a year-over-year improvement of 40 to 70 basis points. Our ongoing annual target for SG&A as a percentage of home building revenue is 10%. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the second quarter increased 111% to $21.5 million from $10.2 million in the year ago quarter. 89% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 43% in the year ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company in this quarter had an average FICA score of 717 and an average loan to value ratio at 88%. David. David Auld : At the end of March we had 21,300 homes in inventory, of which 1,700 were remodels, 10,200 were spec homes and 4,100 of the specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished home inventory increased by $196 million during the quarter, due to our seasonal home construction activity for the spring selling season.  Our second quarter investment in lots, land and development totaled $507 million, of which $282 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $225 million was for land development. At March 31, 2015 our lot portfolio consisted of 122,000 owned lots with an additional 55,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 64,000 of our lots were finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 31,000 are options. Our 177,000 total loan lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive position in the current housing market with a sufficient lot supply that supports strong growth in sales and closings in the future periods. As we invest in new communities for all three of our brands our main underwriting criteria remains unchanged; a minimum annual pretax return on inventory of 20% defined as pretax income divided by average inventory over the life of the community. We expect each community, regardless of brand to achieve this target by optimizing the balance between absorptions, margins and inventory levels, as our underwriting continues to support our ongoing goal continual improvement in the company\u2019s home building pretax return on inventory. Bill? Bill Wheat : During the second quarter we recorded $4.4 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence cost for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $8.1 million of inventory impairment charges primarily related to an expected land sale in our Southeast region. Our inactive land held for development of $271.3 million at the end of the quarter represents 12,900 lots, down 7% from December and down 41% from a year ago. We continue to formulate our operating plans to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels, to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will decline further this year. We will also continue to evaluate our inactive land parcels for potential impairments which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in past. Mike? Michael Murray : At March 31st our homebuilding liquidity included $665.8 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $710 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had $175 million of cash borrowings and $90 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 39.6% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 34.7%. We repaid $158 million of senior notes at maturity in February and the balance of our public notes outstanding at March 31 was $3.3 billion, which includes $500 million of 4% senior notes we issued in February. We had no debt maturities for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and as of today we have a total of $542.6 million of senior notes maturity in the next 12 months.  At March 31, our shareholders equity balance was $5.4 billion and book value per share is $14.78, which is up 11% from a year ago. For the fiscal year-to-date period our cash used in operating activities was $168.8 million, down from $265.8 million in the year ago period reflecting our efforts to improve our cash flow from operations. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, we would like to update our expectations for the full fiscal year, which are still relatively consistent from the beginning of the year. As we are well into the spring selling season and gaining better visibility we are tightening the ranges that we originally provided. Our updated expectations continue to be based on the current relatively stable housing market conditions and we still expect to generate a similar level of profitability and operating margins as our original range. In fiscal 2015 we expect to close between 35,500 and 37,500 homes and generate consolidated revenues of between $9.8 billion and $10.5 billion. We anticipate our home sales gross margins for the full fiscal year of 2015 will range from 19.5% to 20.5%, consistent with our margins during the first half of the year. We estimate our homebuilding SG&A expense will range from 9.9% to 10.2% of homebuilding revenues for the full year. We expect our financial services operating margins to range from 30% to 33%, slightly higher than our original range. And we continue to forecast our fiscal 2015 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36% and our diluted share count to be approximately 370 million shares. For the third fiscal quarter of 2015 we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 78% to 80%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 19.5% to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix, warranty and interest cost and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.2% of homebuilding revenues. David? David Auld : In closing our second quarter growth in sales, closings and profits in a relatively stable market is the result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about the remainder of the year and opportunities ahead. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pretax profits at a double digit pace, while improving cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D. R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands, attractive finish lot and land position and most importantly our tremendous operational team across the country.  We\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and we look forward to working together to continue to grow and improve our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We can now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning guys. Maybe I\u2019ll start out with Express, David and you\u2019re seeing some great growth there on it, are you -- a couple of different things there, are you seeing more competition yet come in to the market to serve this customer base? And then you all talked a little bit about your growth, maybe what we should expect in the timeline and what type of community openings et cetera and where do we sit with the gross margin with that versus the rest of the company? David Auld : Well, Stephen at this point we\u2019re not seeing a lot of competition. People try to come in and compete with us. We continue to open markets pretty much as fast as we can. So we are seeing good growth in that brand and expect it to continue. There seems to be a lot of talk about the lack of first time home buyer coming into the market. That\u2019s certainly not something we\u2019re seeing, where we have been able to get product on the ground we have found buyers. So and from a margin perspective it\u2019s running below the company average but it\u2019s in line with our expectations and in some cases we were able to push margins up so\u2026 Michael Murray : Solid margins over there, but that solid margins and absorptions are very strong. So absorptions are probably bit higher than our original expectations. Bill Wheat : And that then drives the returns in line with our expectations. Stephen East : Okay, got you. David Auld : We\u2019re very happy with it. Stephen East : Okay what we\u2019ve seen in the field has been amazing response to it. I guess you are, if we look at Texas more broadly and Houston specifically, I know your numbers were really good. Can you give us a little bit of color though about what you\u2019re seeing as the progression month by month and maybe what April looked like particularly in Houston as everybody is concerned about it? David Auld : Yes, Stephen I have spent the last month and a half driving our Texas markets, including Houston with the Regional President reporting and his Divisional Presidents. You would think the market would be slowing down but we are seeing consistent performance pretty much across the Board and our April sales are a continuation of what we saw in the first quarter. Jessica Hansen : Stephen, our Houston sales were in line with the expectations for the quarter, our south central region was up 33% in sales and Houston was pretty much in line with the region. So still strong increases out of that market for us. David Auld : I can tell you Steve we\u2019re not seeing a slowdown in our projects. Stephen East : Okay, thanks a lot. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ben Zener [ph] from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, Ken Zener here. Jessica Hansen : Good morning, Ken. David Auld : Good morning Ken. Kenneth Zener : So no good, Steve goes unpunished here today. You talked about in line with orders, in line with expectations. From our analysis while obviously you\u2019re up very strong year-over-year. If I look at pace it looks as though you\u2019re doing normal seasonality sequentially. Could you just comment on that and if that\u2019s accurate? Jessica Hansen : Yes, we would consider it to be in line with normal seasonality. Our sales were up I want to say, right around 50% sequentially. And even when you take into account our change in active selling communities, as we've talked about for a little while, those increases have moderated and so our sales were up about 51% from December to March on about 2% increase in selling communities. So right inline with what we would expect for this time of the year. Michael Murray : Yes so that\u2019s kind of how our seasonality is consistent with what we see but clearly we took a step up in absorptions this year versus last year and that is continuing through the spring. Kenneth Zener : Correct. And then Dave I guess what's interesting, our view or thesis [ph] is this is quantity not quality pointing to actually a lack of supply at the low end being the inhibitor for cyclical growth rather than demand, which would be more loan oriented. You seem to express that view relative to Express Homes. Could you talk about why you think it\u2019s supply not demand when so many people are focused on the tight loans as the issue. What are the differences between your Express buyer and your traditional Horton? Thank you. David Auld : Technically the Express Buyers is buying their first home. 60% of our Express Buyers are first time home buyers. Or they are people that are very conservative and looking for a great buy. I'm not sure there is a lot of difference other than their income levels, between the people buying the Express Home and the people buying a D. R. Horton home. Michael Murray : And just based on our experience thus far what we're seeing when we put the product out there at an affordable price for those entry levels buyers and the current mortgage environment, there is plenty of demand. We're not having any problem selling those houses. So from that standpoint we -- our evidence would show that we think that any limitations for the entry level buyer is supply driven. The mortgage environment, someone has a decent credit score, decent credit history they can get a mortgage today. Kenneth Zener : You do think housing demand is elastic relative to the home prices, what Express would tell you? David Auld : Yeah, absolutely. It's a value driven market. And that's pretty much across the board. Kenneth Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thanks. First question I wanted to ask was about pricing power. So you folks are very clear and appreciate the color you've described, normal demand trends and you've talked about the demand trends and you've talked about the spring selling season being normal, even toned down your gross margin expectations a little bit. But on the other hand you've now had, I think three or four quarters in a row of nearly 30% order growth. Your absorptions this quarter, being up what 25% 26% year-over-year and you've actually taken up your volume expectations. So how do I reconcile those two? I would think with those sort of volume increases you would be seeing greater pricing power but that's not -- doesn't seem to be what you're saying. So how do I reconcile those two? David Auld : So I can tell you, the way we're looking at it is a return based model. And if we can generate a 20% return at the division level, then it's going to drive significant improvement to our operations and overall returns as a company. So where we have the ability to maintain that absorption level and increase production we do. And I can tell you we have seen a significant number of our projects where the margins have improved. Bill Wheat : We are seeing that that we're hitting the pace and our plan pace in the various communities that we get there and then we feel we have pricing that are coming back, incentives have not been increasing, incentives are essentially flat for about a year. And so we're seeing as pace improves we get price, we will get some pricing power back we're seeing in communities. And we're very happy with getting the stability in our margins. Jessica Hansen : The other thing Nishu keep in mind is our mix shift and so our average sales price have moderated in terms of increases, but that's with Express Homes now accounting for 18% of our sales this quarter and 13% at closing at an ASP of about $179,000. So we are raising prices in many of our communities today but we do have that Express grow in mix that's offsetting our overall ASP that you are seeing. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks, that's very helpful. And then the second question, Easter came a couple of weeks earlier than it did last year. So I wanted to ask if there was any effect on demand, maybe it pushed some orders from March into April. So I guess, maybe if you could comment on March relative to April to just let know if there is any affect there. Bill Wheat : I think both year -- Easter was in April both year, slightly earlier this year and we don\u2019t see a big impact there, as David said earlier, April\u2019s continued the same trend we saw through the March quarter. Nishu Sood : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Hello, guys. Can you hear me? David Auld : Yeah, sure. Good to see you, Stephen. Jessica Hansen : Are you there? Bill Wheat : Hello, Stephen. Stephen Kim : Yeah, okay. Sorry about that, technical issues. First question relates to Express and Emerald, you know you have kind of been at this now for about a year or more in the case of Emerald but I am curious about how your thoughts are evolving around the product design? And what -- how to refine the product offering in Express and Emerald? What are the advantage of course that you had been kind of early in launching this product. I imagine when you first came out you had an expectation for what your customers would be looking for and I was wondering if you could share directionally what you have found, if you gone out there, have you found for example at Express people have been looking for not just the really small boxes but that also there is some willingness to maybe move up in terms of size.  And in the Emerald has there been any preference for maybe a little more design or dirt [ph] sales so that they can really kind of customize it more than you initially anticipated when you rolled that product out. David Auld : Stephen, when we first launched Emerald we were launching a brand that was different than what the perception of D. R. Horton had been in the past and so we built really, really [indiscernible] ourselves. And I think as we have met with these customers and kind of defined what they are looking for we are modifying that and we are ultimately it kind of comes back to the same thing that\u2019s on the Express side. People want a great value at a great location and so yes, we are really kind of simplifying what we are doing on Emerald side, focusing on location but delivering competitive house in that market. Michael Murray : Within the Express product we have tried to be consistent with the product offering but we have been sensitive to the markets and where is demand for greater square footage we are certainly delivering that and adjusting the mix, community by community to meet what that buyer is looking for in that community. It is not a one size fits all approach, it is not just the smallest house, as you said, it\u2019s driven by a family need, of the bedroom count since we are -- footage that they need and with the Express efficiencies we gain, we can deliver that value and deliver that a square footage at the price they can get the mortgage for. David Auld : And would you launch Express or Emerald across all of our markets, I mean you are going to learn a lot and you are going to make modifications to improve returns through the process. We are looking at the market, we are identifying where we can get better and we are pushing to get better. Stephen Kim : So if I could paraphrase what I think I heard you say, is it sounds like in Emerald there is maybe an emphasis to really, if anything do less customization and maybe a little bit more that would lead probably to a little more spec activity but more of a focus on value. And in Express I hear that there is some elasticity upwards in terms of the size of the homes. Did I just generally hear that right? David Auld : It would be 100% correct. Stephen Kim : Okay. My second question relates to conversation rate, backlog conversation rate. I think you gave guidance for conversation rate, you are just a little bit higher than where you were last year and that would represent a deceleration in turnover rate from what you did in the second quarter. Generally speaking, we think of conversation rates or backlog turnover rates going up as you do more spec activity and what we are seeing here from the way we model your spec activity it\u2019s continued to go up but yet you seem to be looking for a bit of moderation in your backlog turnover rate. And so I was curious if you could talk a little bit about why that is, is there some exogenous factor that we are not thinking about here or you are just being conservative on your backlog turnover rate or if you can reconcile that for me, that will be great. Michael Murray : You know we did exceed our expectations in the second quarter higher than our range and a bit higher jump in the backlog conversation from Q1 to Q2 than we have seen in the past. What we are guiding to for Q3 in the range of 78% to 80% is conversion [ph] is higher than our conversion rate last year. It is also in line with what we are seeing in our business and in our updated forecast, really from the community level up. So that\u2019s really a large part of what drives our guidance on conversion rate is what our guys, what our operators are telling us they are going to do.  We have had great sales in Q1 and so our backlog is up significantly and certainly we will -- we are going to be focused on closing every home that we can, that\u2019s ready to close and in whatever period it\u2019s ready but today based on the plans that we have in our business, the visibility we have in our business it lines up with that high 70s to 80% conversion rate for Q3. Jessica Hansen : And Steve, if you look at the last five years we really had been a slight tick down from Q2 to Q3 in our backlog conversion rates. So what we are projecting is in line with our sequential changes over the last few years. Stephen Kim : Yeah, got it on seasonality. Thank you very much guys I appreciate it and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall : Hey, good morning and nice quarter. Just one question for me, I just want to understand your comment, obviously you are getting tremendous demand with the entry level product and from a mix standpoint, I think that would drag down your ASP which continued to increase. So I am just trying to understand from a modeling standpoint, whether it\u2019s third quarter or fourth quarter, does ASP start to turn negative on a year-over-year basis, just because you are selling more of the Express Homes? Bill Wheat : Bob, we\u2019ve, really from the start of the year we said we did expect our ASP growth to moderate to the low single digit range and that\u2019s where it is today. There is a number of factors that offset and it\u2019s a little difficult to say whether it will continue to be slightly up, flat, or slightly down. I wouldn\u2019t say we have an expectation, it could be down. Certainly as Express grows that does pull the ASP down. But we are seeing good sales in Horton, good sales in Emerald. We are seeing pricing power in a number of our communities as well. So that ASP is one of the most difficult things to predict, exactly where it\u2019s going to be quarter-to-quarter.  So I think we would stay consistent with what we have said all along this year, expect it to continue to moderate and to the extent it\u2019s up, it will be up in the low single digits. Robert Wetenhall : Got it and the other question nobody has really touched on it, how to think about land spend and land acquisition in terms of the cycle and where you are at? Thanks very much. Michael Murray : I think so far this year we are about consistent in our land spending and largely looking at replacements of the lots that we have been delivering. We feel like we have got a very strong owned and controlled lot position over 170,000 lots available for us. So I don\u2019t see a huge growth in our land acquisition spending at the present time but we still do see opportunities in all of our markets and we will continue to invest. David Auld : I think the key for us right now is we don\u2019t have to buy anything. We are in a very strong position, where we see A plus deals than we can -- we are moving on those with a lot of energy and a lot of aggression. Bill Wheat : Just to replenish our lot supply at the level of volume we are at today there is still going to be significant investment. It will be north of $2 billion, $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion somewhere in here in land spend for the year, consistent with last year. Robert Wetenhall : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael Dahl : Hi, thank you. My first question, I understand that there, on a total community basis the community count growth has been fairly modest. But wondering just given the rollouts in Emerald and Express if you can breakdown, you said sales doubled in Emerald, sales tripled in Express, what was community count growth versus absorption in those two parts specifically? Jessica Hansen : Mike, we haven\u2019t actually disclosed our community count in total or by brand. But clearly we are growing our Express community count at a faster rate than the rest of the company. In absolute terms the number of homes sold doubled -- or tripled and then on Emerald we are growing that still, we are growing it at a slightly slower rate than we are Express, but our absorptions improved dramatically in both of these brands in addition to having some community count growth as well. Michael Dahl : Got it and then this is my second question, if we think about Express and how is the product that we have seen in person, it seems like the strength in absorption is such that the backlog delivery times have stretched out, call it five, six months and so just wondering at what point do you think you have maxed out sales velocity in terms of absorption at Express, and so incrementally you\u2019re likely to just see growth coming from the community rollout versus incremental gains and absorption at Express? David Auld : It\u2019s a project by project comment. I will tell you we have a lot of projects out there where we continue to expect absorption for community to increase. Some we have maxed out and then some are our bigger Express offerings. We are building everything we can build on it. So in those projects we\u2019re taking margins up. Michael Murray : My comment would be no different in a Horton community or an Emerald community, that\u2019s the case community by community across our country all the time. Michael Dahl : Okay, thank you. David Auld : That\u2019s a very good problem. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone. First question, I had was just wanted to circle back to the pricing trends during the quarter. I think David in your initial comments you kind of just characterized the market overall as healthy and relatively stable demand, growing moderately and I think just you kind of highlighted as well that you are still raising prices in a bunch of communities, but overall how would you characterize the pricing environment? I mean what we\u2019ve heard is kind of just kind of stable to maybe just slightly increasing and incentives by and large, incentives/discounts by and large stable. I mean obviously market to market that varies but on a broad basis is that kind of what you\u2019re seeing? David Auld : That\u2019s pretty much the market out there right now. It\u2019s a great market for us because we\u2019ve got the land, we\u2019ve got the operating platform, we\u2019ve got the people in place. So we\u2019re not having to make any investments. We\u2019re just riding the market. It jumps up then labor becomes a bigger issue and some of the higher price land that have been bought by others becomes competitive and we like the way deals run, it\u2019s a good market for us, or consistent, absorptions are consistent, margins are consistent, yes, just continuing to gain market share. Michael Rehaut : Yes no, certainly and I guess just the second question here, I appreciate all the detailed guidance for the year and like you said kind of tightening the ranges here and there. One area of focus for many is the gross margins and that did come in a little bit, of course on the flip side you slightly raised the closings and revenue and lowered SG&A. So don\u2019t want to exclude that but people do focus on the gross margins, the slight lowering of the range or lowering the high end of the range, could you just elaborate on what was the driver there, is it mix, is it maybe costs coming in slightly higher, any color there would be helpful. Bill Wheat : Michael I think we\u2019re seeing there we are six months into the year at this point. So we\u2019ve been through a very good spring selling season. We posted two quarters of margin in the 19.7%, 19.8% range and looking forward we see continued stability around that level. So it\u2019s not necessarily price pressure that\u2019s come in to play. I think we\u2019re seeing that our pricing relative to our sales price, our cost increases relative to sales prices have moderated and we\u2019re not losing ground there.  We\u2019re seeing some stability in our reported margins and probably in our go forward margin at this point. So at this point half way through the year, at the turn we\u2019re looking to kind of tighten that range down around what we posted. Michael Murray : We\u2019re very pleased with that, to find that stable level in our normal range and obviously we\u2019ll work to improve it in here. Bill Wheat : And you alluded that mix change does have an impact on this, our Express margins which are making up a bigger percentage of our deliveries are at a slightly lower margin rates on average with their faster absorptions than the company average right now. Michael Rehaut : Right, okay. No fair enough, appreciate it, thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Good morning. First in terms of the Express product, can you tell us a little bit about your ability or your confidence in realizing the efficiencies that you see in those sort of core three markets where you\u2019re currently selling through, as you expand into the rest of your areas? David Auld : The Express was designed to be a very efficient product to build, and as we build it more and more times we\u2019re getting better and better at delivering it and that\u2019s across all three of those markets. Susan Maklari : Okay, and then in terms of material pricing and any of labor constraint can you just sort of talk to that and if there\u2019s anything we should be aware of there? David Auld : Part of what I think it\u2019s going to be one of the big constraints in this cycle is going to be labor. And we are focused on creating efficient plans that will allow us to build more houses with less labor and that\u2019s been an ongoing effort now for really the last couple of years. Jessica Hansen : Susan as Mike just alluded on one of the previous questions, we have seen our rate has increased and our cost come down a bit. So our stick and brick cost per square foot this quarter was up about 4.5% on a year-over-year basis and that still wasn\u2019t in line with our revenues but it\u2019s a smaller increase than we\u2019ve been seeing and headed in the right direction. Sequentially we actually saw our stick and brick cost increase per square foot almost essentially in line with what our price per square foot did. So we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on that front and we plan to continue to do so as we move throughout the year. Susan Maklari : Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randow : Hi good morning and thank you for taking my question. In terms of this cycle versus past cycles, how are you thinking about cash and cash returns or said it differently, given I would call that certainly a slowdown but from a land investment perspective you\u2019re not buying at I recall the same year-on-year pace, you previously were, would it make sense to step up the dividend or think about some other capital returns to shareholders? Bill Wheat : First as we look at our land supply we did make a lot investments early in the cycle and so we built up our land supply to a very sufficient level to support really strong top line growth for a few years here. So we are working into that and so our requirements to increase our land supply really not there right now. So the pace of spending has slowed but as we said earlier our pace will continue to be at a very strong pace in terms of reinvesting in the business. We\u2019re constantly evaluating our opportunities to invest market by market. We\u2019re focused on achieving a 20% ROI, so pretax income over average inventory on every project that we invest in. It\u2019s one of our key investment criteria and to the extent we were finding deals that can do that in markets that we feel confident in we\u2019ll continue to invest strongly in our business.  That being said, we do expect and one of our goals is to continue to improve our cash flow. We did see and are seeing improvement in our cash flows from operations. We\u2019ve improved year-to-date a 100 million or better in terms of cash use from operations this year versus last year and we believe we\u2019ll see significant improvement by the end of the year on a year-over-year basis. So heading towards the breakeven and hopefully a positive cash flow position.  We\u2019re focused right now on achieving that and when we achieve that certainly that opens up a lot of flexibility for us either to invest further in the business, to look at other opportunities to look at distributions to shareholders as well, all those things come into play when we get to a stronger cash flow position. Will Randow : Thanks for that and just a quick follow up on Texas. It seems like from our vantage point things slowed a little bit in January and February and then snapped back towards the end of March. I guess from that perspective what activity have you seen and there\u2019s a big differentiation point between your higher ASP homes and your lower ASP homes and thanks again. Bill Wheat : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything in Texas outside of our expectations and pretty consistent performance across our price points. Our exposure in Texas is long and deep. We\u2019ve been here a long time, it\u2019s home and our presence in the markets is very tailored to the individual markets and we\u2019ve not seen anything outside in Texas that\u2019s occurring outside of our expectations right now. We do watch it closely, but we are very happy with Texas\u2019 performance. Jessica Hansen : These are normal seasonal trends Will in January and February. So our sales cadence in Texas was increasing as we moved throughout January and February, which is what we would expect as we move into the early part of spring. David Auld : I have been in almost every project, every slide [ph] that we have in Texas over the last month and a half. And I can tell you there is no defining point about whether one of them is doing really well or not doing well. Across the board they are almost 100% on target and at the price point of the Express or the price point of Emerald. Texas is a good market for us right now. Will Randow : Thanks again. I appreciate the time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. Looking at the regional order trends, I mean we had East up 40, Southeast up mid-30s, Central up mid-30s and then Southwest was below that cluster. Guessing that\u2019s a community count growth driven issue, is that a strategic plan or do you think community count in the Southwest will grow, which should help the overall growth rates in coming quarters? Jessica Hansen : You know that Southwest is one of our smaller regions, and it\u2019s only made up of few markets, including Phoenix and you are right that our community count is impacting their sales rate and their community count was down this quarter and their absorptions were up. But their absorptions were a little bit slower than the company average and at really no point is Phoenix continuing to be a little bit more of a challenging market for us than other parts of the country that are just growing faster. David Auld : Phoenix is a great city. Phoenix is going to be a great housing market again, it\u2019s not there right now but we have big expectations for Phoenix down the road. Jack Micenko : Okay, great and then you have grown Express from 13% to 18% of sales sequentially. You also talked about getting into more -- most markets I guess by the end of the year. With your land pipeline in your sort of near-term how do we think about Express from a mix, I mean is it 20%, 25%, 30%, I mean how big of a component of the business does it become in the foreseeable future? Michael Murray : Yes, we certainly would expect to get up into the high 20s, exactly where that lands for the long-term is hard to say, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if it got to the high 20% to 30% in terms of units and that may translate to 20% of revenues, but really we are focused project by project, market by market, expanding where it makes sense and where locations are good and then we will see where it lands. David Auld : And we are laying out a plan and just kind of thinking about the business long-term we would expect at some point, Emerald to be about 20% of our revenue, Express to be about 20% of our revenue and the core Horton brand to be the balance of 60%. Jack Micenko : Great, that\u2019s helpful. David Auld : That\u2019s good balance, gives us coverage in every market, that\u2019s kind of the long-term plan. Jack Micenko : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just quickly on the inventory impairment, can you provide any color on what drove that, and how that split between options walk away cost and anything one time or community specific? Bill Wheat : Jade, we had, I believe $8 million of impairments this quarter, that was primarily related to one community in South Florida that we have owned for a long time, that the opportunity came to sell it and we thought that was a better use of cash to be able to reinvest the cash with some current investment opportunities. There were about $4 million of option write-offs and earnest money, due diligence cost that we rolled off during the quarter for projects we are not pursuing. Michael Murray : And Jade we have said consistently for a while that we are sort of working through actively on our former land held for development or moth balled communities and that\u2019s a source of cash for us and we are trying to turn those inactive, unproductive assets into productive ones. So most of the projects that we have pulled out of mothball we put into production, we are building houses on and we haven\u2019t had any impairment charges but there are the occasional projects we have had and we might have a few more, that the best answer is to sell it and those have a higher risk or higher likelihood of having some impairment chargers but I would tell you in general our expectations for charges going forward are definitely lower and we expect fewer charges again going forward over the next year then we have seen over the past 12 months. Jade Rahmani : Great, thanks. And regarding the orders growth, I was wondering if you anticipate a moderation in the year-over-year pace of orders growth from the strong 30% level, just given last year\u2019s strong comps in the second-half of the year. Jessica Hansen : Jade we have really just guided to what we expect to do this year in terms of closings. I don\u2019t think we want to make any educated guesses on sales, but clearly we have to drive a good sales pace to hit the closings guidance that we went ahead and updated this quarter. Bill Wheat : So high 20s to 30% is our guidance for year-over-year, and we have to sell at that pace to close at that pace. Jade Rahmani : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Gilbert [ph] from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. David Auld : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Just a follow-up on the commentary on land spend, you guys said you are largely looking at every place of land, the land is being delivered, would this indicate a continue deceleration in year-over-year community count openings? Bill Wheat : Right now we expect it to remain relatively stable. Our expectations all year have been that we would continue to see relatively stable to slightly up low single-digit on community counts and I think that continues to be our expectation for the short to medium term, that\u2019s something we are always evaluating as we are making our investment decisions. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great, thanks. And then just on the overall absorption level, absorptions have been increasing at a very rapid pace over the past three quarters. Are you getting to a level, just companywide that you are more comfortable with or do you think there is still room to continue pushing absorption growth higher? Bill Wheat : I think we have some on communities that we talked about before we do have a limit that we probably hit, but there are certainly several communities we have, that we identified for increases in absorptions. So we will continue to look to operate the company on a community by community basis at the right pace for that community to drive the expected returns. Michael Murray : As we look throughout company we always like plenty of opportunities to get better and plenty of opportunities to improve. So we will keep doing that. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks good morning. I appreciate the additional color you guys offered on the FHA and VA loan percentages at the mortgage spec. I was curious though, could you may be provide any detail on how many of your mortgage closings are coming from 0% down financing including USDA and/or VA loans, any -- and in just a broader sense are you seeing a return to the drive to your qualified type mentality among buyers? Jessica Hansen : What we have seen in terms of VA is pretty consistent. It ticked slightly down. So we will have this in our supplementary data on the investor part of our website after the call. But our VA percentage was 18% and we also saw a slight decrease in our USDA percentage from what we have been running down to 5%. So those were the two products most likely and to have zeroed down in them I don\u2019t have [indiscernible] are overall zero down.  In terms of driving the qualified we are going to a little further out in some cases for Express to hit that value proposition and people do still want to seem to do that but in terms of where our communities are located today compared to kind of back during the boom we are not nearly back out those areas again and there might some of the those areas we don\u2019t ever go back to. Buck Horne : I appreciate that. And my follow-up is just going back to the Texas discussion, obviously doesn\u2019t look like you are seeing much sign of slow down at the entry level, in fact there is a lot of people still going -- migrating into those markets with your numbers but some competitors have noted maybe some softening at the higher price points, where you maybe a move up market or white color jobs that might be at risk in those markets. Have you guys seen any signs of moderation in Houston or otherwise at some of the higher price points in those markets? David Auld : We are in the higher price points, but we are in the higher price points really positioned over the last couple of years and there are locations that for us at least today we are not seeing any slowdown. Maybe it's there are areas where people were selling higher priced homes that are seeing a slowdown. But our experience today is that the locations we have chosen and entered in last couple of years are still very high demand. When we launched the Emerald brand we focused on location. And that has been a prudent focus. Buck Horne : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session.

The supplementary information which we encourage you to review includes historical data on gross margins, changes in active selling community, product mix and our mortgage operation. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding third quarter. Our pre-tax income increased to $334 million on $3 billion of revenues, and our pre-tax margin improved 330 basis points to 11.3%. Our sales absorptions continue to improved during the quarter, as our homes sold increased by 22% from a year-ago on only a slight increase in active selling communities. This reflects strong performance in our core D.R. Horton communities and growth of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands, which are enable us to expand our product offerings and our industry leading market share. Our continued strategic focus is to leverage our operating platform to produce double-digit growth in both revenue and pretax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. During the third quarter, we generated $357 million positive cash flow from operations. With a sales backlog of 12,761 homes at the end of June. Solid sales trends in July and a well-stocked supply of land, plots and homes, we are well positioned to finish our year strong and have an even stronger 2016. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income for the third quarter increased 96% to $221 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to $113 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 94% to $334 million in the third quarter, compared to $172 million in the year-ago quarter. And home building pre-tax income increased 90% to $302 million compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 37% to $2.9 billion on 9,856 homes closed, up from $2.1 billion on 7,676 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,000, up 7% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in our average sales price per square foot and to a lesser extent of larger average home size. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 25% from the year-ago quarter just $3 billion. And homes sold increased 22% to 10,398 homes on 1% increase in active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter increased 3% to $289,400. The calculation rate for the third quarter was 22% compared to 24% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 15% from a year-ago to $3.7 billion with an average sales price per home of $293,400 and homes in backlog increased 12% to 12,761 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 81%. We expect our fourth quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 81% to 84%, up from 76% in the fourth quarter of last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : We are experiencing strong growth in revenues and profitability in our D.R. Horton branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. We also continued to be pleased with the progress and performance of our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. Emerald Homes our brand for higher-end move-up and luxury communities is now available in 46 markets across 18 states. In the third quarter, homes price greater than $500,000 accounted for 16% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed. Our Express homes brand, which is targeted at the true entry-level buyer, focused primarily on affordability, is currently being offered in 44 markets and 14 states with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to-date coming from Texas, Florida, and the Carolina. This quarter Express accounted for 19% of our homes sold, 16% of homes closed and 10% of home sales revenue. The average closing price in an Express Home in the third quarter was $188,000. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our operating markets with all three of our brands and we plan to maintain consistent broad diversity in our product offerings over the long-term. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 19.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter. The consistency in our gross margin in the first three quarters of the year reflects the stability of most of our markets today and the normalization of housing market conditions we have seen over the last year. We are raising price or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our target absorptions and we are working to control cost increases. These factors have enabled our gross margins to stabilize within our normal historical range. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged from what we have shared the past several quarters. In the current housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. For the upcoming fourth quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin will be consistent with our margins for the first three quarters of the year in the high 19s to 20%. Mike? Mike Murray : Homebuilding SG&A expense for the quarter was $258 million, compared to $222 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of home building revenues our SG&A improved 160 basis points to 9% compared to 10.6% in the prior year quarter as our significant revenue increased this quarter improved our leverage of fixed overhead cost. Based on our projected backlog conversion we expect our SG&A as a percentage of homebuilding revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 8.7% to 8.9% which would be a year-over-year improvement of 100 to 120 basis points, we are very pleased that our homebuilding SG&A in fiscal 2015, will be below our longstanding targeted 10% and we believe we will further improve our SG&A leverage in fiscal 2016. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter increased 140% to $31.7 million, from $13.2 million in the year-ago quarter. 88% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 43% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company in this quarter had an average FICO score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. Mike? Mike Murray : At the end of June, we had 21,200 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 9,400 were spec homes in all stages of construction and 3,600 of these specs were completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory decreased by $100 million during the quarter, while our number of homes in inventory remains relatively stable. Our completed specs declined by 12% during the quarter. Our third quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $575 million, of which $311 million was to replenish finished lots and land while $264 million was for land development. Our residential land and lot inventory increased by $82.5 million during the quarter. David? David Auld : At June 30, 2015 our lot portfolio consisted of 120,000 owned lots with an additional 54,000 lots controlled through option contracts. 65,000 of our lots were finished, of which 32,000 are owned and 33,000 are options. Our 174,000 were total loan lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to supports strong growth in sales and closings in future periods. Although our housing inventories will fluctuate if we manage each of our communities to optimized returns, we expect our land and lot inventories to remain relatively stable during the remainder of 2015 and in 2016, which will allow continued positive cash flow from operations. In the third quarter, we generated $357 million of positive cash flow. For the nine month period ended June, we generated $189 million an improvement of $762 million from the same period in the prior year. Bill? Bill Wheat : During the third quarter we recorded $3.7 million in land options charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $11.7 million of inventory impairment charges, of which $7.4 million were in our West region primarily related to a long-held inactive land parcels that we intend to sell to improve our returns by redeploying the capital into more productive assets. Our inactive land held for development of $235 million at the end of the quarter represents 12,800 lots, down 25% from a year-ago. We continue to formulate our operating plans to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels, to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. We also will continue to evaluate our inactive land parcels for potential impairment which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Mike? Mike Murray : During the quarter, we acquired the homebuilding operations at Pacific Ridge Homes for $70.9 million of cash, of which $2 million was paid subsequent to quarter end. Pacific Ridge operates in Seattle, Washington. We acquired approximately 90 homes in inventory, 350 lots as well as control of approximately 400 additional lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 42 homes valued at $18.7 million. Bill? Bill Wheat : At June 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $767 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $881 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $94.3 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 37.5% and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 31.6%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $3.3 billion. We have no debt maturities for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and we have a total of $543 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our shareholders equity balance was $5.6 billion and book value per share was $15.35, up 13% from a year-ago. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our number of homes closed to approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 81% to 84% and then average sales price in the range of $285,000 to $290,000. We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be consistent with the first three quarters of the year in the high 19s to 20% subject to potential fluctuations from product mix, warranty and interest costs. We expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.7% to 8.9% of homebuilding revenues. We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margins will be in the range of 35% to 40%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be between 35% and 36% and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be approximately 371 million shares. Our projected revenues and profitability for the full year of fiscal 2015 are inline with the expectations we\u2019ve been communicating since the beginning of our fiscal year. Our expectations are based on today\u2019s housing market conditions. Our current preliminary expectations for fiscal 2016 also our consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 10% to 15% and for our consolidated pre-tax margin to be in the range of 10.5% to 11%. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million to $500 million for the full fiscal year which we expect these primarily towards debt maturity. We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2016 will be between 35% and 36% and then our diluted share count next year will increase by approximately 1%. David? David Auld : In closing our third quarter growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our operating platform and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. With the expectations Jessica shared for the fourth quarter \u2013 we believe our closings for the full year of 2015 will increase by approximately 27% representing an increase of 8,000 homes. And land right in the middle of the range outlined in the start of the year of around 36,500 homes. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit pace for generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands. Attractive finished lot and land positions and most importantly our tremendous team across country. We made considerable progress this year toward our goal of producing sustainable positive cash flow from operations. While still growing the business, we generated $189 million of cash in the first nine months of the year, an improvement of $762 million from the same period of 2014. We expect continued positive cash flow in 2016. We\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work. In my opinion, the best of the industry. Now go forth and finish the year strong. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will host any questions. Operator : Thank you, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. Mike Murray : Good morning. David Auld : Good morning, Ken. Jessica Hansen : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zener : David, you talked about FY16. You didn't have to go there, no one even asked you. Can you walk us through the process of why you wanted to do that now? Your revenue top line of 10% to 15%, what type of community count does that involve or absorption or just talk about how you kind of get there and the confidence around your EBIT given a very strong fourth quarter SG&A guidance? Kind of a broad question, but take what you want. David Auld : Well, right, Ken. No, I guess I\u2019m excited because I think we just delivered a great quarter. But I think the positioning we did or have done over the last 12, 18 months, has set us up for a good run. And we just see general solid markets across the country nothings exploding but everything seems to be getting a little better on the month to month, quarter to quarter basis. And a waiver position and what we\u2019re focused on right now and what we\u2019ve accomplished leveraging the SG&A and just controlling cost I think it sets us up to containing what we\u2019ve been doing. Jessica Hansen : On the community count front Ken, the 10% to 15% consolidated revenue growth that\u2019s really mainly driven by volume coupled with a little bit of price and in terms of community count we would expected to be low maybe top out mid-single digit growth. So the majority of that revenue growth is coming from further improvement in our absorptions. And we\u2019re not guiding to the 20% to 30% of next year like we did this year. So we don\u2019t have to expand our absorptions quite as dramatically as we did in fiscal 2015, but still very confident that we can drive further absorption improvement as we move throughout 2016. Ken Zener : Very helpful. Now, because you had such strong pricing momentum year-over-year, you have been right about six. It sounds like you do not expect your successful mix shift towards Express to result in price degradation, realizing there is different mix, pricing mix there, between your different products. You said positive price, correct? David Auld : I think it kind of flat to moderate price improvement, yes, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen thus for. We came into the year expecting relatively flat pricing due and part due to the expectations of mix shift to Express and while Express that certainly grown shortly as a percentage of our business that impact has been offset by price appreciation and to the extent we continue to see current market conditions as we move into 2016, hopefully that will continue. Ken Zener : Thank you, very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Very encouraging to see your land spend being very disciplined. It is something that I certainly applaud what you are doing there and I think it is going to be very interesting. So I guess my first question would be, with respect to, if you can continue to generate this kind of cash, you have already said this year, you're looking to do, applying it to the paydown, what should we expect going forward in 2016? I know that in the past there has been some talk about your wanting to run at a much lower level of leverage than you have in the past but I also know there's been a little bit of conversation about that, shall we say, at the corporate office. So I was wondering where your thoughts are right now in terms of where that is going to be in 2016? David Auld : A very opportunistic, excuse me. We\u2019re going to spend $2 billion plus just replacing what we deliver as we consistently generate and prove at a sustainable. It\u2019s going to give us a lot of opportunity, I guess we\u2019ll sure that when we get there. Jessica Hansen : And just to clarify Stephen the comments towards debt reduction were specific to fiscal 2016. We have $543 million in maturities in the next 12 months. So that would be what we expect in fiscal 2016 and then when we\u2019re looking further out we\u2019ll have more commentary to share later. But as David said opportunistic. Stephen Kim : Got it, okay, that\u2019s helpful. That will continue to watch that. My next question I guess relates to Express. You know obviously, good success over there. We have observed that your average price within Express has been rising, pretty meaningful I think it was up 19% this quarter and it\u2019s been kind of accelerating there. I was curious if you get sort of share little bit about what is going on there I imagine some of that maybe just geographic mix shift. But perhaps or something additional going on there where you \u2013 in terms of the kind of buyer that you are seeing come out for your profit \u2013 just if could share some thoughts there? Mike Murray : Steve, this is Mike. Most of what we\u2019re seeing with the Express price changes is mix shift as we\u2019ve introduce it to more markets that have the higher bar for the industry level buyer. We\u2019re seeing the result of those come through in the closing. Stephen Kim : Okay. David Auld : Pretty much the same thing. Mike Murray : Level of buyer, buying the Express product. Stephen Kim : Got it. And in terms of where the markets are that you\u2019re going to. What should we be thinking about that? Mike Murray : Most of it \u2013 where you\u2019re seeing the impact in this quarter\u2019s ASP has been closing from \u2013 the state of Florida. Great success in Florida introducing Express over the past year and we\u2019re starting to see a greater proportion of the Express closings coming from Florida with the higher sales prices. Jessica Hansen : We\u2019re still about 80% of what we\u2019re doing in Express is Texas, Florida and the Carolina and the sizes in that order for those states in terms of percentage contribution. And we\u2019re opening that in a lot of other places, but the vast majority of Express sales and closing to-date are in those three states. Stephen Kim : All right, thanks very much guys. David Auld : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning, guys. When you in your prepared remarks, I think everybody believes your volume growth is coming from express myself included, but it sounded like more of this was coming from your core Horton brand. Is that a fair representation of what's going on and could you talk about maybe the trends within the three products and where the gross margins breakout in the three products? Bill Wheat : Yes, Steve, this is Bill. We\u2019re seeing growth really across all of our brands a solid growth, solid demand across all of our brands and actually with the roll out of Express being introduced into more and more markets. It is growing as a percentage of our overall business, as we introduced the product in more markets, but just when we look at all three brands, we\u2019re seeing solid, solid growth across all three. In terms of relative gross margins as we\u2019ve kind of sale all along our expectations and what we\u2019ve seen is the Express comes in a little bit below our average margin for the company, but we\u2019ve been encouraged by the margins that we\u2019ve been able to generate in Express and then our expectations for our Emerald, our higher end product is that it will generate a bit higher gross margin than the average, but our return expectations are the same across all brands. Stephen East : Okay. And then geographically you talk some about Florida in the rollout, is that what really drove that market that was the Express rollout and could you talk some about Texas, what you are seeing any impact with energy in Houston that type of thing. David Auld : The Florida market in general is just getting better really across all three brands. The rollout which impacted for pricing mix on this Express was \u2013 initially launched we launched in Central Florida middle part of the state much more price competitive then, we\u2019re introducing the product later which is kind of Southeast, Southwest. So you are just seeing a lift from those two various which I think it is a part of the overall increase in pricing in Express. But now state of Florida we feel very good about that. Stephen East : And then you mentioned Texas, we are seeing solid demand across Texas, Texas is so extremely strong for us and we saw, essentially our South Central region is largely Texas, and so we are very pleased with the performance across the state of Texas. Stephen East : Okay, North Houston dynamics going on right now with oil. Mike Murray : Certainly we continue to watch Houston on a year-over-year basis, Houston sales were basically flat, saw higher average prices this year than last year in Houston, but clearly the Dallas market continues to be extremely strong, San Antonio seems to be picking up for us a bit, and Houston continues to be solid for us as well. Stephen East : All right. Mike Murray : We definitely watching Houston, but we\u2019re just still be at the level it is, it\u2019s still encouraging. Stephen East : Okay, thanks. David Auld : We grew very fast in Houston for about three or four years, so kind of a flat year-over-year this year, it is actually? Stephen East : It take the replenishing community count in that market, is that a problem, with land pricing moving up? David Auld : We were very well positioned in Houston 2012, 2013, and the community counts in Houston again are very well positioned. Bill Wheat : We are still opening communities, we\u2019ve been preparing the open for the last year, year and a half. Stephen East : Okay. David Auld : The prices mixed actions and so. Stephen East : Got you. All right, thanks. Operator : Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thanks, first question I wanted to ask, you mentioned solid sales trends continuing into July, there has been some concern obviously with rates rising whether some threats to consumer confidence, so I was wondering if you could just take down into that a little bit and you now how things look to from the end of the Spring selling season into the Summer and just your thoughts if any of those specific concerns if you have any perspective on whether or not that \u2013 those have affected your trends or not? David Auld : Well, if we get up everyday, thinking about sales, so yes, if we\u2019re up 30% we\u2019re concerned, we are not up 50, we\u2019re up 20 we are concerned, we are not up 30. That\u2019s just the nature of our journey. But we travel in the markets down, moving this right now driving sales divisions. And the general field across pretty much every market is it\u2019s a little better today than it was last year. And there is a confidence in our operators, there is a confidence in our sales, in our model homes, traffic is steady. So it\u2019s been a slow recovery, but consistent and it just seems to continuing, so we feel good about that. Nishu Sood : Got it. So would be fair to say then it sounds like the momentum that we\u2019ve seen so far this year as persisted into the summer. David Auld : Correct. Nishu Sood : Got it, great. Okay. And I wanted to also ask about the cash flow very impressive cash flow performance this quarter. I think you guided to $300 million to $500 million if I got the number correctly for next year and fourth quarter, your next quarter is typically pretty big cash flow quarter as well. Your guidance implied that share count will ride so no share buybacks in your debt paydown. My question was with cash flow so strong, your with your net debt to cap fairly low against the kind of typical to start building norm of 40% to 45%. Have you given any thought to allocating some to share a purchases because we\u2019re based on what you implying you can have a strong book value growth, you get a paydown quite a bit of debt I mean you are going to continue to delever and you are going to be pretty far below that historic norm. So what your thoughts on share buyback saying a little more balanced about reallocating that cash. Mike Murray : Yes, Nishu. We\u2019re pleased to be in a positive cash flow position. We\u2019ve been focused on achieving this. And we\u2019re feel like we\u2019re in a position now to continue to generate sustainable positive cash flow. And we\u2019re going to take a balanced approach to it. We will always look first to our business to invest in the business and be opportunistic there to the extent that we can generate returns there and that will include acquisitions as we continue to steadily be in that market. With over $500 million of debt maturities it coming to next year that is a higher priority for us in fiscal 2016. But then certainly as we get into 2016 and we look beyond that other opportunities will be out there and available for us certainly we\u2019ve continue to be a consistent dividend payer, there is potential with that good increase as our earnings in cash flow continue. And then share repurchases would be one of those items that we would look at in the balance as we are opportunistic and if we see that is a good return and that\u2019s an appropriate use for our cash, it will certainly be considered long side the other things. Nishu Sood : Got it. So the 1% increase in share count that you are talking about, that\u2019s a general range, but there could be some flexibility around that. Mike Murray : I think there always been flexibility, as we stand right now with no Express intent of repurchasing shares in 2016, we would expect our share count to rise by about 1%. Nishu Sood : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Robert Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall : Hey, good morning and a nice job on the quarter. Just wanted to ask on your preliminary 2016 guidance, you are coming in higher than we thought and higher than your pre-tax income margin for 2015. So I\u2019m just try to understand is the way we should think about the 10.5% to 11% range you gave derive from better gross margin performance or is that a SG&A leverage. Mike Murray : Rob, what we\u2019re seeing we showed in the third quarter its an improved SG&A leverage. Margins were essentially flat throughout this year firmed up nice and stable and we\u2019re seeing some improvement with our absorptions driving up in our communities. We\u2019re seeing improvements in our SG&A leverage falling right to the operating margin improvements we\u2019re seeing. And we fully expect to continue that in the fiscal 2016. David Auld : Bob, it is David. I continue the general consensus is flat, as we hit these absorption targets and as a market stays steady. I do think there may be a little upside in margin, but we\u2019re going to guide to flat and attempt to do what we say we\u2019re going to do. Robert Wetenhall : Okay, cool. Those are ambitious targets I hope you get there. I wanted to ask about your average order price is up almost 3% this quarter. And just taking through you know you have easy comp in the fourth quarter, but can you talk just about how you are thinking about the trajectory of pricing given mix. There is some commentary about bigger four plans being a positive to more sales as the entry level product. And I just kind of want to get a hand to one how you think this involves into 2016. Thanks very much and good luck. Jessica Hansen : So Bob, in terms of further price appreciation we\u2019ll see ASPs one of the hardest things for us to determine we don\u2019t necessarily look at Q4 is an easy comp though we had a very, very strong up last Q4 I think in the high 30s is in reserves. And so to us that\u2019s not an easy comp. But we\u2019re going to continue going out and everyday hitting our targets on a community by community basis and continuing to drive sales improvement and it\u2019s a markets there we\u2019ll get the price. But the markets really going to determine that and from where we sit today with the impact of mix from Express. We would continue to expect our ASP to be flat to slightly up in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. 290,000 ASP on deliveries and just shy of that on sales is pretty much in all time record for us. And with the continued mix impact from Express, I don\u2019t think we expect to necessarily move that needle a whole lot further. Robert Wetenhall : It makes a lot of sense. Good luck, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. Two questions, in regards to I guess leverage within the business that community count plan and leveraging SG&A. Just interested if strategically you\u2019re thinking differently or having a different level of success in both of these areas. That is one of the factors that\u2019s helping your profitability improve? David Auld : I think we\u2019ve always \u2013 stressed leverage on the SG&A line and getting as much as we can out of our fixed overhead and so what we\u2019re seeing now is low to single-digit growth in our community counts driving greater absorptions from those communities. And generally we\u2019re probably replacing communities that are closing out with slightly larger communities they\u2019re opening up, allowing us greater opportunities for increased absorptions and better leverage at the community level. For us this business all happens at the community level. The pace we drive at a given community helps drive improvements in margin efficiencies in the construction processes as well as better leverage of the overhead associated with that community. Mike Murray : And when we look at SG&A leverage to the extend that we drive a good part of our volume growth from increased absorptions. In existing communities that drives even more SG&A leverage than driving growth from community count increases. So our focus there on improving absorptions is definitely a big driver for our SG&A leverage and as we look at it \u2013 going forward we believe we got more opportunities to improve it. Eric Bosshard : And if I could one follow-up on gross margin after couple years of progress kind of step down it sounds like stable to \u2013 slightly favorable may be gross margin outlook. Just talk a little bit about the moving pieces you\u2019re seeing within gross margin now and as we project forward over the next 12 or 18 months? Jessica Hansen : On a year-over-year basis Eric, we continue to face headwinds. Particularly on laboring materials and to a lesser extent lands but sequentially those trends have been getting better. Which is what you\u2019ve seen in the stability in our gross margin and sequentially as we\u2019ve moved throughout this year. So our gap is between our revenue increased per square foot and our cost increased per square foot this quarter. With the best we\u2019ve seen in quite some time, our revenues per square foot were up 4.1% year-over-year, while our stick and brick cost we\u2019re still slightly higher than that, but at 5.3%. So that 120 bps different is one of the narrower we had over the last year, year and a half. And to a lesser extend \u2013 as expected we\u2019re starting to see on a year-over-year basis slightly higher land cost on a per square footage basis as well. But I think we feel really good about \u2013 moving into 2016, especially with the trends we\u2019ve seen sequentially. And hopefully we can see it benefit next year. You know it\u2019s only July, so we\u2019re not going to go out on a whole lot of wins yet, as far as gross margins concerned in 2016. But we feel very good about remaining stable and if we can move it up or we\u2019re going to move it up. Eric Bosshard : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael Dahl : Hi, thank you. Couple of follow-up questions. First on the discussion around Houston, I wanted to ask if you could give a little more of a breakdown on what you are seeing across price points obviously some other builders have talked about some weakness at the higher end or mid-to-high end. And so what are you seeing across the different brands. Is this really still just being driven by express and then also if the overall orders flat, what is the community count like in Houston year-over-year. David Auld : Our community count is roughly a similar to what it would have been a year-ago. Yes, I think in general we\u2019ve heard commentary from other builders as well. We don\u2019t have a huge presence at the high end. We have a few communities at the higher end in Houston. And so I\u2019m not sure where a good proxy necessarily there. But we have clearly continued to see very strong reception at the entry level and first time move up level, so in our for express and Horton brands and that\u2019s really where the core of our business is in Houston. Michael Dahl : And along that\u2026 David Auld : We are hopeful to get relatively well. Mike Murray : We\u2019re very happy with Houston. Michael Dahl : Okay. So on a \u2013 I guess on a positive note then it\u2019s a pretty strong trends in the Southwest. And then so wondering how much that\u2019s being driven by Phoenix or Vegas and what's the absorption trends in those markets specifically. David Auld : I hope we\u2019re seeing out there a pretty much Arizona Phoenix is picking up a little bit, seeing some good sales trend there, but coming up a pretty small base. So it shows us a large percentage, but the prior year numbers where fairly small. Las Vegas is actually in our West region. So it\u2019s not impacting our Southwest numbers at all. Michael Dahl : Got it, okay, thanks. David Auld : We just like Phoenix for us has been a very good market in the past on a leading in the company. And I have every belief that it will be again. We\u2019re seeing life in Phoenix and glad to see it. Michael Dahl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter. First question, I had was just going back to the SG&A for a moment. Obviously great improvement there, and better than expected. It looks like the full year will be around 9.6 instead of 9.9 to 10.2 your previous guidance. Just tying to get a sense of perhaps what are the drivers of that leverage or was there any type of cost take outs that, that you are able to exact as you kind of moved into back half of the year. And again, just confirming in terms of 2016, the pre-tax margin improvement all effectively at this point you expect to be driven by SG&A as well? David Auld : SG&A will definitely be a big part of the driver of the improvement in our operating margin next year, probably the primary driver, at least as we sit here today in July. SG&A there is a lot of factors that go in there, and there is a lot of focus that we spend in the company on it. We talk a little bit earlier with our improved absorptions in our existing communities that\u2019s clearly a driver of SG&A leverages we\u2019re not having to add the incremental cost with additional community counts. But also I would attribute to some of our focus on being more efficient with our inventory investments in our housing investments trying to improve our turns there. That clearly drives more SG&A leverage. That you will see our specs counts are little bit lower then where they have been here recently, and that cuts out some SG&A cost as well. And I would say there is a just a general focus on the company that as we grow, while we continue \u2013 have to continue to add overhead to support that growth in our expected growth. There is a discipline that I think is in place across organization to make sure that we keep our overhead in line with where our businesses and that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves there. I just \u2013 there is probably a bit of caution with adding of additional overhead, that I think we are now seeing some very good leverage from as we grow right. Michael Rehaut : I mean just looking little bit past next year, when you think about you are at 9.6 this year, if most of the improvement is going to be driven by SG&A next year. Because I believe correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but David I think you pointed to an outlook our expectation for gross margins to be flattish, that would put you at a SG&A closer to 9% and that\u2019s essentially the best type of level you did. In company history hit it low 9s in 2004 and 2005 and so. As you think around that 9% mark, is that something that you can actually improve from and what I\u2019m really getting at here is \u2013 there is structural difference and how you\u2019re running the business that can allow for SG&A to get into the 8s as you progress into mid-cycle or just any thoughts around that? David Auld : Mike, at this point in July, we are not going to guiding to a 9% SG&A in fiscal 2016 as of yet, but clearly, if we expect to improve from where we are this year. We would expect to get below 9.5 and into the low 9s next year and we have achieved 9.0 before in the past. So it\u2019s not all the realm of possibility. We are focused on just continuing to incrementally improve, incrementally leverage it. And we do believe that if we are able to continue to drive growth for multiple years beyond 2016 that we can continue to drive incremental SG&A leverage beyond that and could that result in us getting below 9 at some point in the future beyond 2016 that certainly possible. But I think that is a little bit of a longer potential. Jessica Hansen : And our 10.5% to 11% that we guided to for 2016 was a consolidated margin. So we could potentially have some upside on our financial services business as well. We see as we move throughout the year and we\u2019ll have more color to share. Michael Rehaut : Okay. So just lastly then if I\u2019m understanding it right, a little bit of the improvement you\u2019re expecting from gross margin expansion, or is it going to be closer to more stable-ish? David Auld : We\u2019ve operated this year in the high 19s, 19.7 and 19.9 about first three quarters. We consistently say we expect our margin to be around 20. So if we come in around 20 that next year, that would be a slight improvement in our gross margin from this year. Michael Rehaut : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question Susan Maklari : Good morning. David Auld : Good morning, Susan. Mike Murray : Good morning. Susan Maklari : In terms of your specs, you noted that they were down about 12% during this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about that even it such a big part of your strategy and if there is any change there that we should be aware of? David Auld : We saw our competed specs go down by 12% during the quarter, which is a pretty seasonal movement for us through the spring selling season, as we\u2019re selling those homes that we build and had inventory available for our customers. But specs as you said are always have been a big part of our business. We\u2019re very comfortable building speculative homes, and we think it opens up a new buyer to us that we wouldn\u2019t have before just building homes for the customers. Mike Murray : No real change in our strategy there. We\u2019re tying to operate as efficiently as we can and so our expect percentage is a little lower than perhaps you\u2019ve seen in the times in the past, but really there is no change in strategy at all. Susan Maklari : Okay, perfect. And then can you just give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the mortgage market. It sounds like things are kind of continuing to maybe incrementally improve there, but what do you think? Jessica Hansen : Probably exactly what you just said, Sue. To us, the mortgage environment is okay. Assuming a buyer has decent credit and has a little bit of money to put down which isn\u2019t unreasonable for somebody buying a house. Buyers can get credit today. So we\u2019re seeing plenty of traffic come in and that can qualify. Our cancellation rate has settled out into the low 20s and that still the main reason people do cancel. They can\u2019t qualify for the mortgage. But that low 20s rate is not unusually high or something we\u2019re uncomfortable with. And we haven\u2019t seen much in the way of change, but I do think you continue to just see very gradual incremental loosening. That probably at least all signs point right now that will continue. I don\u2019t think we expect any broad movements in the market to really open the flood gates again. But just continued improvement in components then more buyers coming out and feeling better about their ability to qualify. And whether the standards have actually changed or not. I think we would point to as more of a positive over the past year. Then the actual mortgage standards themselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SAG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : Hi, good morning. Your FHA, VA mix picked up pretty significantly year-to-year, is that price cut driven or is that more or some of the expansion you seeing on the VA side, just curious what's driving that. Jessica Hansen : Yes, Jack. It\u2019s not a pickup on the VA side or VA was pretty much flat. So I think what you are seeing is an impact from the pricing getting more favorable on FHA coupled with a higher share of express. And coming through our closings which is a higher FHA percentage than our reporting in Emerald buyers. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then just looking back I guess the last couple of months, as the 97 GSE return had any impact on demand any of you. Jessica Hansen : No. Jack Micenko : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first, if you could provide a comment on the land market where you are seeing overall and where there is a still good opportunities to invest. Mike Murray : I would say yes, we\u2019re still seeing good opportunities overall. I mean even replacing we\u2019ve \u2013 just replacing what we use we\u2019re going to spend $2 billion plus this year. We\u2019re discipline, we\u2019re basically underwriting it to two-year cash back program generating a certain level return 20 % and if we can get it in that box and its buy for us. I can tell you we\u2019re seeing deals we\u2019re getting it done. Bill Wheat : No shortage of deals out there available. Jade Rahmani : Okay. And then just regarding the SG&A outlook in terms of employee retention and yes, sustaining the growth rate in topline, what do you see as the risk of having to sort of reaccelerate the amount of dollars been SG&A spent. David Auld : The SG&A savings are being driven by revenue increases and efficiencies gained in the operation. This is not a cut employee program. In fact, some of our highest paid people are in some of our lowest SG&A divisions. And it\u2019s because of the revenue driven and the efficiencies they operate with. So it really comes down to driving sales or flag per month. If you look at our 8,000 additional closings this year on a relatively flat community count that 290,000 per ASP, per average sales price and that\u2019s driving a tremendous amount of revenue out of the same store sales. So this is not a \u2013 this model is protecting employees, not put them in risk. Jade Rahmani : Thanks. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randow : Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Mike Murray : Thank you. David Auld : Hey, Bill. Will Randow : I\u2019m just kind of thinking about in the past you\u2019ve talked about return on inventory on your, your loss supply is down, I\u2019ll call it close to \u2013 a little under four-year supply. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and looks like inventory growth is slowing down especially with land held for development coming of the balance sheet. Where the opportunities to improve \u2013 I guess, returns on asset as well as how do you think about leverage in that context for ROE? Bill Wheat : Yes, Will. This is Bill. Yes, return just clearly the focus on our end our strategy, its balancing our inventory investments and trying to get the right balance of volume and absorptions compared to pricing and margins profitability to drive the best return in each one of our inventory investments and we\u2019ve been saying for a while. We feel like our land supply was that a sufficient level or our owned land supply was sufficient. And so we\u2019re maintaining that at around the same level. We own about 120,000 lots today. And we\u2019ve been essentially in the range of 120 to 125 or so for two years. That\u2019s still a sufficient level for our current volume and we expected that it will support continued strong double-digit growth for the remainder 2015 and in the 2016. And with our growth and improvement profitability with a more stable land supply that\u2019s improving our returns and we expect to continue to drives some more from that. Jessica Hansen : If you look at our homebuilding ROI on a trailing 12 months. It\u2019s actually up 100 basis points as compared to fiscal 2014 and we would expect to continue to make further progress on that in Q4 in fiscal 2016. Will Randow : And I guess as a follow-up is a land bank in market there it\u2019s used to run 50/50 I\u2019ll call it control versus owned in order to improve ROI. And also on the leverage front, do you think about you should be running closer to group medium leverage to hit kind of the group or total of the better ROE? Mike Murray : With regard to your first question on the optioning of land and lots, we are working continually to increase our controlled lot position and trying to get back more to the 50/50 balance. That is exactly where we have been in the past and that's where we\u2019re striving to get to today. That helps us greatly with the return on our invested inventory. With regard to the ROE, as Bill mentioned before our initial use of the cash that we\u2019re looking for in 2016 are handling - the $540 million of debt maturities that we have next year. As well as continual opportunistic investments in the business, whether that\u2019s land and lots deal by deal or whether that\u2019s continued acquisitions as we look to consolidate mortgage and open up the new products and new customers to us. With that great opportunities \u2013 in front of us with the cash flow and we\u2019re always monitoring \u2013 the leverage ratio and looking at what we feel is appropriate for where we are in the given cycle and the opportunity that are there. Will Randow : Thanks guys and congrats on the quarter. David Auld : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. A bit of a bigger picture question I guess. And that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve seen multi-family as a bigger percentage of total start for a while now. I\u2019m curious whether you see that as secular or cyclical. How was that all might be impacting you in some of your markets, even if \u2013 indirectly presumably. And whether in forms that all in any of your medium to longer-term decision making? David Auld : You know on multi-family something that we look where the demand is in each market and we build some multi-family and it\u2019s not a big percentage of our business at all and so we really look at that market by market, I don\u2019t see that being a major driver of our business going forward. But in certain market it\u2019s only a bigger percentage of business. Mark Weintraub : And \u2013 I guess that - when you think about growth for the single-family business. Are you \u2013 of the view that we\u2019re going to catch back up to prior compositions multi-family and single-family. Which would presumably you have it extra engine of growth from that change in mix or you to view we\u2019re probably going to stay at these higher levels of multi-family for a while, at a national level recognizing that you have your own individual markets, obviously have a single-family? Jessica Hansen : Mark, I\u2019m sure we really have a view. I mean our focus is primarily on single-family and we\u2019re not too worried \u2013 where that split is going to fall out going forward. Our goal everyday is to go out and increase our market share and each of the market we currently operate in. And so we\u2019re going to gain as much of the single-family market as we can. Mark Weintraub : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. Alex Barron : Hey, good morning, guys. Good job on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the outlook for 2016 and towards community count. Are you guys seeing one of the brands growing more than the other or they all is your outlook pretty much the same across the board, in other words are you seeing more demand or more investment going into the express versus the other brands or not. David Auld : No, not, not really pushing money towards a brand, we\u2019re allocating money based up on the returns coming out of the markets and then coming out of the underwriting individual projects. As we continue to open the express brand end markets then it\u2019s growing of a slower platform. So its going to show percentage higher growth. Our goal is grow every brand, every market, every year. Alex Barron : Okay. And I don\u2019t know if I missed it or you didn\u2019t mention it. But you gave us the percentage of home sold for Express. But I don\u2019t think you gave it for emerald, you just said closings and revenues. Jessica Hansen : Sorry. Alex, we\u2019re looking for that. That\u2019s going to be included in our supplementary data that we will post to the website right after that call. Alex Barron : Okay. That just for this quarter or you are going to go back a few quarters also? Jessica Hansen : No. Our supplementary data that\u2019s out on our investor relations site has on trailing eight quarters from its all of the data it may only have one or two shy of that for the brands just because of the brands are newer than that. But a pretty much has our entire history from a brands perspective. Alex Barron : Okay, great, thank you. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James and Associates. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks guys. I appreciate for the opportunity here. Most of my questions are answered, but I want to go back to just a clarification on Pacific Ridge, the acquisition there. Did any of the reported order totals this quarter include Pacific Ridge backlog and would you expect any sort of purchase accounting drag from the acquisition this quarter? Mike Murray : It was a relatively small acquisition to the size of overall closings I would not expected a big purchase accounting drag from Pacific Ridge at all. It contributed, we have 40 closings, 41 closings in the quarter for Pacific Ridge, largely that will come out of the opening backlog and then 25 net new sales within the quarter from Pacific Ridge. Jessica Hansen : And but we did not add on their backlog to our reported sales for the quarter. So our sales number for the quarter was pure Horton with our other brands inclusive of the 25 sales that Mike just mentioned. Buck Horne : That\u2019s perfect. Okay, and my last question, just going back to the express home division and just, I think one things we are trying to wrestle with, what\u2019s the credit profile of that buyer today in terms, whether it\u2019s the FICO score or the average down payment they are able to put down on the home. New home sales under the $200,000 price points are still kind of looking a National number still the weakest of all the category. But yes you guys are taking any credible amount of share and I\u2019m just kind of wondering, to what extend you can share either the secret sauce or how deep do you think that buyer pool really is? Jessica Hansen : Sure, in terms of the mortgages, I can give you some idea of, what that looks like for those buyers that are utilizing our mortgage company. And in a FICO score is really quite strong as well and it\u2019s close to 700 on average for our Express buyers, the loan to value isn\u2019t that for off from our company average, it\u2019s slightly higher which was to be expected with our higher percentage of FHA loans being used. The debt to income is right inline with the average for our overall company and then obviously the loan amount is a little bit lower, just because of the lower average sales price. So I think we still really, really good about the depth in the market for that buyer and continue to prove it with the strength in the sales we\u2019re seeing across all the places that we\u2019ve open that Buck Horne : Thank you, very much Mike Murray : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Buck Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We just want everybody to know, we appreciate your time on the call today. I want to tell our employees that they are in fact the best in the industry, I appreciate what you do everyday. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2015 conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead, Jessica. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financial results. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.

For your convenience, this morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-K next week. After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary historical data on the Presentations section of our Investor Relations site for your reference. The supplementary information includes historical data on gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix, and our mortgage operations. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Office; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team finished this year with an outstanding fourth quarter. Pre-tax income increased to $339 million on $3.2 billion of revenue. And our fourth quarter pre-tax operating margin improved 60 basis points to 10.7%. Our sales absorptions continued to improve during this quarter as homes sold increased 19% on a relatively flat community count. This reflects solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands, which are enabling us to expand our product offering and industry-leading market share. For the year, while demand for new homes across most of our markets remained relatively stable to moderately improved, we generated growth of 30% or greater in both our home sales revenues and home building pre-tax income by successfully leveraging our platform as the nation's largest and most geographically diverse homebuilder. Our consolidated pre-tax income for 2015 increased 38% to $1.1 billion on $10.8 billion of revenue and 36,648 homes closed. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. During the fourth quarter, we generated $512 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated by operations for the year to $700 million. Our return on inventory, defined as homebuilding pre-tax income divided by average inventory, improved 170 basis points in 2015 to 12.8%. With a sales backlog of 10,662 homes at the end of September; solid sales trends in October; and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for 2016. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Net income for the fourth quarter increased to 44% to $239 million or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $166 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 35% to $339 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $251 million in the year-ago quarter, and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 27% to $302 million, compared to $237 million in the prior-year quarter. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 27% to $3.1 billion on 10,576 homes closed, up from $2.4 billion on 8,612 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $288,600, up 3% compared to the prior year due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $2.5 billion, and homes sold increased 19% to 8,477 homes, while our community count remained relatively flat. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 3% to $289,500. The cancellation rate for the quarter was 27%, down from 28% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increase 10% from a year ago to $3.1 billion, with an average sales price per home of $295,100, and homes in backlog increased 8% to 10,662 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 83%, within the range we guided to on our third quarter call. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : We are experiencing solid demand, revenue growth, and profitability in our D.R. Horton-branded communities, which accounted for the substantial majority of our sales and closings this quarter. Emerald Homes, our brand for higher-end, move-up, and luxury communities, is available in 46 markets across 18 states. In the fourth quarter, homes priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 17% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed. For the year, homes priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 16% of our home sales revenue and 7% of our homes closed. Our Express Homes brand, targeted at the true entry-level buyer focused primarily on affordability, is being offered in 48 markets in 15 states, with the significant majority of our Express sales and closings to date coming from Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. This quarter, Express accounted for 22% of our homes sold, 21% of homes closed, and 14% of home sales revenue. The average closing price of an Express home in the fourth quarter was $191,000. For the year, Express accounted for 18% of our homes sold, 15% of homes closed, and 10% of home sales revenue. We're striving to be the leading builder in each of our operating markets with all of our brands. And we plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity over the long term. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 19.9%, flat with the third quarter. The consistency in our gross margin this year reflects the stability of most of our markets today and the normalization of housing market conditions. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. And we're also working to control cost increases. All of these factors have enabled our gross margins to stabilize within our normal historical range. Our general expectation for fiscal 2016 is that gross margins will remain relatively stable with fiscal 2015 levels. In the current housing environment, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%, due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest cost. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest cost. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, consistent with our margins during fiscal 2015, which were in the high 19%s the entire year. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues improved 100 basis points to 8.9%, compared to 9.9% in the prior-year quarter. Homebuilding SG&A for the full fiscal year also improved 100 basis points to 9.6%, compared to 10.6% in fiscal 2014, as our increased revenues this year improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We are pleased that our homebuilding SG&A in fiscal 2015 was 40 basis points below our long-standing target of 10%, and we expect further improvement in our SG&A leverage for fiscal 2016. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter increased to $37.3 million from $14.2 million in the year-ago quarter. And for the year, financial services pre-tax income increased to $105.1 million from $45.4 million in fiscal 2014. Increases in our financial services profits for the fourth quarter and fiscal year were primarily due to improved loan sale execution, higher average loan amounts, and leverage of fixed overhead costs. 89% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the fourth quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 52% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume, compared to 42% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 715, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : At the end of September, we had 19,800 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 9,700 of our total homes were spec homes, with 6,300 in various stages of construction and 3,400 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory decreased by $314 million during the quarter, and our number of homes in inventory decreased by 7%, a normal seasonal trend after our strongest home closings quarter of the year. Our completed specs decreased by 6% during the quarter. Our fourth quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $590 million, of which $305 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $285 million was for land development. Our residential land and lot inventory increased by $54.5 million during the quarter. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : At September 30, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 174,000 lots, of which 118,000 are owned and 56,000 are controlled through option contracts. 67,000 of our total lots controlled are finished with \u2013 of which 33,000 are owned and 34,000 are optioned. Our 174,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods. In 2016, we expect our total owned land and lot inventory balance to be in line with or slightly higher than 2015. And we also plan to increase our optioned land and lot position. In 2015, we invested $2.2 billion in land, lots and development. And in 2016, we expect that our investment level will increase by more than 20%. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Our inactive land held for development of $202 million at the end of the year represents 11,100 lots, down 13% from June and down 21% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns, and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $5.1 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $21.2 million of inventory impairment charges, of which $12.2 million were in our East region, and $9 million were in our West region. These charges related to two long-held inactive land parcels that we sold during the quarter and one long-held project in production. Each of these actions resulted in improved returns and redeployment of capital into more productive assets. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future impairment charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate, as they have in the past. Also, during the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $9.8 million related to one of our operating divisions in our Southeast region. Our total goodwill balance after this impairment is $87.2 million. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : At September 30, our home building liquidity included $1.4 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $865 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $110 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage was 36.1%, and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 25.1%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $3.3 billion. And we have a total of $543 million of senior note maturities in fiscal 2016. At September 30, our shareholder's equity balance was $5.9 billion, and book value per share was $16, up 14% from a year ago. Based on our solid balance sheet, liquidity, and current and expected levels of profitability and cash flow, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 28% from the most recent dividend paid to $0.08 per share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Looking forward, we would like to highlight some of our expectations for next year. They are consistent with what we shared on our call in July and are based on the current relatively stable to moderately improved market conditions. In fiscal 2016, we still expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 10.5% to 11%. We also expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion and to close between 39,500 and 41,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2016 will be in the high 19%s to 20%, with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate that our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be in the range of 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues, with the first two quarters of the year higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters below the range. We expect our annual financial services operating margin to range from 30% to 33%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2016 income tax rate to be between 35.5% and 36%, and our diluted share count to be approximately 375 million shares. We also continue to expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations. Our fiscal 2016 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we will update our expectations each quarter as our visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clearer. For the first fiscal quarter of 2016, we expect that our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 75% to 78%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be in the range of 10.5% to 10.9% of revenues. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : In closing, 2015 was our third consecutive year to generate 30% or greater increases in both home sales revenues and homebuilding pre-tax income. While significantly growing the business, we also generated $700 million of positive cash flow from operations. And our annual return on inventory improved 170 basis points to 12.8%. This is a result of the strength of our people and our operating platform, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet; industry-leading market share; broad geographic footprint; diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land position; and, most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We'd like to thank all of our employees for their great work and tremendous accomplishments this year, and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Wetenhall, your line is now live. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Please pick up your handset. Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry. This is Collin filling in for Bob. Thank you for taking my questions. So prices were up by about 3.4% on a consolidated basis. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what prices were doing on a brand basis and how much of a headwind the change in the product mix was. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : In general, across the board, community-by-community is where we're seeing pricing. On a brand basis, mix is a big factor. On our Express brand, as we've been rolling it out into more markets, the more recent markets we've rolled it into are at a higher ASP. So we have seen an increase in our average ASP in Express, as we've expected to see. On the Emerald brand, again as we're rolling that out across the country, we've seen that have a fair amount of fluctuations from quarter to quarter. But in the current quarter we're in the mid-$500,000 range. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Collin, this will be in the supplemental information we'll put out after the call, but our closing ASP for the quarter on a sequential basis was up across all brands. It was mix that brought the overall down sequentially slightly. And on a year-over-year basis, we were essentially flat in Emerald but up substantially in Express and Horton. Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. And then as you look forward into 2016, how do you see your portfolio on a brand-by-brand basis kind of as a percentage of total deliveries? And what are your expectations on gross margin for this? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We continue to expect both Express and Emerald to grow as a percentage of the business, as they did this year. As we roll them out into further markets, we would expect by the end of fiscal 2016 that we would have Express into most of the markets that we expect it to be in. And in terms of percentage of revenues, certainly could be nearing the 20% level. And Emerald, in terms of percentage of revenues, would start moving up \u2013 further up into the higher single digits. Collin A. Verron - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Strong quarter. Good job in the quarter. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Had two questions for you. First of all, it seemed like your cash flow guide was a little low and your cash balance at the end of the year was a little high. By my reckoning, even if your land spend were to increase 25% \u2013 I think you said more than 20% is what you thought \u2013 your cash flow could still be pretty similar to what we saw in 2015, if my numbers are right. And I think you got about $550 million or something that we're looking for in debt paydown next year, which is going to leave your cash balance pretty elevated. So I was curious, first of all, if you could talk about why your cash guidance is sort of so much lower than what you did this year. And then, secondly, sort of where you feel comfortable with your cash balance residing? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As we look forward \u2013 Steve, this is Bill \u2013 a lot of the level in which we will reinvest or the level in which we will invest depends on what we see in the sales environment in the spring this next year. So at this point, as we look forward, we feel comfortable that a $300 million to $500 million range will occur even with a reinvestment level north of 20%. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's possible we might invest even higher than that if we see sufficient strength in the market or the need. But if we stay at around that 20% level, yes, your calculations are in the ballpark that we could be at the higher end or maybe even above that range on cash flow. But we're certainly in a flexible position, and we'll adjust our investment decisions based on what we see in the market as we get into calendar 2016. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. So my next question relates to M&A. We did an analysis, and it looked like over the last 15 years, that Horton's pretty much \u2013 you guys are the only ones that have really grown your business outside of acquisitions or at least grown your market share outside of acquisitions. And, at the same time, there's a pretty wide gap in price-to-book valuations among the public builders. And my question is, what's your opinion on the M&A opportunity that you see over the next year? And is there any reason you might prefer privates or publics when you look at the opportunity set? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, this is David. We're continuing to look at opportunities. We're in the position we're in because we've been disciplined about it and trying to find the right cultural fit when we do combine. If you look at our history of merger and acquisitions, the culture and fit has typically been more important than the assets that we're acquiring. So we're going to be disciplined and opportunistic. But, yes, we are looking continuously and believe that where we find a good fit at the right price, it's an additive to our company. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much, guys. Good job. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Thank you, Steve. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Thank you, and congratulations on a nice quarter. Just to follow on Steve's question a little bit. You will have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet, Bill, even in your scenario and paying down the debt. So if you could talk a little bit about, with that excess cash, what you would like to do with it, and a bit more generally your capital allocation for 2016. You gave the land spend guidance. But where is it happening, and what percentage of these communities are 24 months or less? Is that still a big focus for you? And just where you expect that community growth to be next year? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : The level of community growth. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Steve, this is Bill. I'll start at the back end. We are still working with our 24-month cash return as our base underwriting guidelines. And vast majority of the land we're buying will fit within that. We're certainly in a flexible position, and occasionally strategically we might go outside that box. But vast majority of the time we're staying within 24-month cash return. In terms of community count growth, we've stated we expect it to be relatively flat to slightly up. Low to mid-single digits would be probably the top end of the growth expectations. Really, we're looking across our business. We've seen significant increases in the Southeast over the last couple of years, but we're seeing a few markets perhaps starting to show some signs of life further north, and in the Southwest as well, that perhaps we could \u2013 it may be time to show some growth there. So really looking across the breadth of our business. As we look at our cash flow expectations for the year, of course, we did announce an increase in our dividend, a 28% increase in that, so that's already out there as far as the use of our cash. We are going to remain flexible and opportunistic around investments in the business. Great position to be in with $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of cash today heading into the spring. And then we want to see what the spring demand is and decide our level of reinvestment in the business there, but still feel comfortable with that and still be able to generate $300 million to $500 million of free cash flow next year. The debt maturities of $543 million are certainly a priority for us. Again, flexible position. We certainly have the cash to be able to pay it all in cash if we were to so choose. Our current expectations is that we would refinance a portion of that and pay off a portion of that in cash, so that our net balance would decrease a bit. Past that, really, our mantra is remain opportunistic while remaining disciplined. And all things could be on the table, but we want to keep our options open. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks. Very thorough there. And then if you look at what all the other builders have been talking about, the labor, the costs, et cetera, maybe you all could frame how much costs are up year over year, both labor and on the land side. And then just what you're seeing on the labor side. Some of your peers have said they expect it to get a lot worse before it gets better, and what you all are seeing and how you're going to offset it moving forward. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Stephen, this is the first quarter that we did see, on a year-over-year basis, our revenues tick up in \u2013 per square foot \u2013 in excess of our stick-and-brick costs, which would be both our labor and materials. Our revenues per square foot were up about 4%, whereas our stick-and-brick per square foot was up 3.5%. The sequential trend was good as well. Our revenues outpaced our stick-and-brick. You didn't see that flow through as an increase to our margin because we do have slightly higher land costs today. But, as we mentioned, our margin's stable in spite of higher land, labor, and material costs, and we were able to offset the majority of that with pricing this quarter. So we've been working on that this entire year to get that back in check, and happy to say that we got there by the end of the year. In terms of labor, I mean, David will probably speak to how we feel about labor overall. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, David. No question; labor is tight. The reports coming out of other builders \u2013 I mean, we're not immune to it. I think we have mitigated it by having the best operating team in the industry. And the relationships that our people have with vendors, suppliers put us at the front of the line. So it flows back to the time with a company, time in a market. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Okay. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And what I believe is the number one competitive advantage, which is our people. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : David, do you expect it to get worse in 2016? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think it's going to get any better. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : Okay. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I do think we're approaching \u2013 the market continues to improve. The latest jobs report did show 30,000-plus construction jobs being added. Why it's taken this long to start adding those jobs I'm not sure, but hopefully that's a trend of something that's going to take place. And we will re-staff our production so that we get back to a normal national building environment. Stephen F. East - Evercore ISI : All right. Thank you. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to go back to some of the market discussion, and I think, Bill, you mentioned there may be some areas that are showing some signs of life and maybe deserve some more investment. So I guess if you guys could give us a little more color on where some of those markets are and just the overall cadence that you're seeing in some of the key markets in your footprint, because you've described it as relatively stable to slightly improving. I think some of your peers have seen a bit more volatility as of late. So any color there? And also if you could quantify October sales being solid, what's that actually mean relative to what we were seeing this quarter? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mike, going backwards, October sales were \u2013 we're happy with our October sales level in line with our expectations, but as we always said, one month does not quarter make. And looking at individual markets, we've been very happy with our Texas performance, which is our South Central external region, primarily. Continue to see good performance in the Southeastern part of the country. And as (31:14) in the communities we invested in there, we've built a great presence. And perhaps some of the markets out west in Arizona are starting to show some encouraging signs as well. But it's hard to really quantify market by market when we look at this. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Okay. And then second question, just around the goodwill impairment. So in the Southeast, just curious, is that related to a legacy position, or is that one of the more recent acquisitions? Can you talk about the factors that drove that and if there are any other implications we should be thinking about on a go-forward basis, whether it's what that means for margins or sales out of that region? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That related to one division within our Southeast region. That was the Huntsville market that we entered as a result of the Breland acquisition in 2012, and that was as a result of some challenging market conditions in Huntsville. And I don't look for any read-through to any other markets or margin effect anywhere else. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : And Huntsville is a relatively small division in terms of our overall platform. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your questions. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ken. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, David, kind of wrapping up this year, and I wonder if you could comment. I mean, obviously, under your tenure, you kind of just started disclosing information a little differently than Don did in the past. The question I have for you is about seasonality in your business, because you guys, with the release that you give after this conference call, we can see kind of the trailing-three-year seasonality in orders. And when you look at your year-over-year results, what it shows is increasing absorption. But that actually occurred all in the first quarter seasonally. You didn't go down like you normally did. Can you talk to or kind of address if, when you think about the cadence of your business, which I assume you look at it seasonally, do you still expect that kind of slightly higher absorption rate, which is new the last few years, to unfold in kind of that first quarter? Or do you expect it to go down like it did historically, about 20%? Because it seems like you guys kind of changed the cadence of the business a little bit in recent years. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Yeah. We would still expect to see normal seasonality in the business, which would infer a decline in Q1. Sales \u2013 we don't guide to sales for a reason. It's really hard for us to estimate what our sales are going to be. We did give guidance for the full year on closings. So clearly we have to sell at least that many homes, if not more. So we do feel like we're going to close between 39,500 homes and 41,500 homes for the full year. But, as you saw in Q4, and as we've talked about, we're not going to be at a 30% growth rate moving forward. We did that for three years straight, and \u2013 going to be hard to do that again. But we do think our consolidated revenues will be up 10% to 15%. And Q1's typically our softest quarter, and we do expect to see normal seasonality in Q1 and really not know what the year holds until we get to the spring. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Ken, this is David. I'll also say that weather did impact kind of the process last year. And we had a great year because we have great people. But tight labor and weather conditions are a reality in this industry. So that kind of made some things shift around a little bit. But, yes, we're a seasonal business. We plan to build, sell, and close based upon what the historical seasons have been. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good. And I appreciate that. I just was asking because the last two years in the first quarter, your pace actually went up modestly. So I just wanted to understand how you thought about that. But it sounds like it's somewhere between what we had in the last few years and the usually down 18% sequential pace, somewhere in that broad range. Can you talk \u2013 David, you said you don't expect labor to get better, but I mean you are, I believe, the largest homebuilder. And it would seem that that issue would impact you most. But closings, et cetera, et cetera, you've been able to navigate it. I mean, is it that you're paying people more, perhaps? Because it really \u2013 all the smaller builders' issues would seem to be magnified. Can you just explore that a little bit more, because it really does seem to require a little more explanation how the largest person is navigating this issue while the smaller guys can't do it? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think we're paying people more. Actually, I think we got a lot of efficiencies and benefit from our overall market share and presence. You guys are going to get tired of me saying this, but it really is the people. We got the \u2013 one of the toughest markets, toughest weather conditions, toughest labor markets, is our Dallas-Fort Worth area. And those two guys, because they have been in the market for 20-plus years, because they have a direct relationship with the vendors and suppliers, make a call and get people to show up. And you just can't put a \u2013 you can't quantify that and put it into a model. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : And they're both also perfect examples of where local market share and building specs on a consistent basis really comes into play. So that, coupled with their experience is really why we think we've been able to not have that show up as much in our results as it has in others'. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : But it's not just Dallas-Fort Worth. We've got people like that in every market. So. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And could you just comment on the gross margin between spec and backlog, if that's relevant now? Thank you very much. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : A word about our normal relationship between spec and overall. Spec margins are a bit below \u2013 100, 200 basis points below the company average, which is about normal. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : They were about 200 basis points below build jobs. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Below build jobs, yeah. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So the company average is slightly... Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Much closer, probably about that. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Yeah. We feel about 70% of what we closed this quarter was a spec. So the margin we reported is essentially a spec margin. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and also nice quarter. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Michael. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Thank you. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Thanks, Mike. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question I just had was on guidance, and just wanted to make sure \u2013 it appeared that essentially you reiterated all the components of fiscal 2016 guidance with perhaps the exception of giving a little more clarity to SG&A. Before, I think you said below 9.5% of consolidated revenue, and now you're saying 9.2% to 9.5%. Do I have that right? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Mike, we actually on our last call only gave the consolidated pre-tax margin as official guidance. We had some sidebars as we got into the Q&A. But our official guidance in July was just for the 10.5% to 11.5% consolidated pre-tax margins, so we did reiterate that on this call. And then our SG&A guidance for fiscal 2016, which is \u2013 this the first time we're giving what we would consider to be our official SG&A guidance \u2013 is for 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And then \u2013 I appreciate that. I think that sounds right. Yeah, some of that was on the Q&A, I guess. And just to be clear also on the SG&A. You're talking about the homebuilding revenue inclusive of land sales. Is that right? And that's also how you're describing it for 1Q? Is there a way for us to get a sense of what you're anticipating land sales to be? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : No. As you indicated to me earlier today, our land sales are choppy, and we do know that. But when we look at our SG&A, we look at it all in, as a percentage of our total homebuilding revenues. And that lines up with our income statement, with \u2013 \"total homebuilding revenues\" is actually our line, but is inclusive of both home sales revenue and land sales revenue. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Yeah. Just \u2013 obviously creates a slight incremental challenge with modeling, but I guess we can talk about that later. Also, on the fiscal 2016 outlook, I think, Bill, you mentioned expecting community count to be up low to at most mid-single. I would presume, given that it looks like, at least from a trend perspective, Express 4Q activity stronger than the full fiscal year, that that would \u2013 that the fiscal 2016 should have a higher proportion of Express versus 2015. Would that then result in sales pace improvement of at least 5% to 10%, just from that continued shift alone? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Obviously with our guidance of 10% to 15% revenue growth with low to mid-single digit community count, where we are anticipating incremental absorption improvement, and part of that \u2013 one driver of that \u2013 is the continued rollout of Express. As it has been this year, as a contributor to some absorption improvement, we do expect further absorption improvement driven by Express, as well as our efforts to continue to be more efficient across all of our brands across all of our communities in the company. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then just one last one if I could. The land investment north of 20%, obviously a pretty strong number, and certainly we're not at mid-cycle levels yet. Although I would think that at this point, at least from your peers, maybe not growing that incremental investment as aggressively, not all have reported that yet. But when you talked about the 20%-plus growth, is that reflective of more development versus finished lot type of takedowns, or just from a bigger-picture perspective, you're also talking about lots growing, I would assume, not at the same rate as the 20%-plus. So just kind of give us a sense of what's the drivers there, because obviously there are other builders out there that are maybe taking a slightly \u2013 I would presume \u2013 slightly more conservative view as you get deeper into the cycle. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Mike, yes, there is a distinguishment we need to make between the level of investment we're going to make versus the level of our inventory balance \u2013 our land inventory balance on our balance sheet. We do expect to grow our spending, our investments, by more than 20%. We do expect some increase in our development spend in that expectation and then some increase in our absolute spending for land acquisition. Our percentage of our land acquisition spend has been pretty consistent, and around half of that spend has been for finished lots. And we would expect that to continue, especially as we increase our option lot position and continue to add to that and buy finished lots there. So there's still a very strong element of finished-lot purchases in that. But even with an increase in our spending or investment level of greater than 20%, we only expect our balance sheet \u2013 our land inventory balance to be relatively stable to slightly grow. So what we're essentially doing is replenishing our lot position, and that's kind of what we've been doing for the last year to two years, is essentially replenishing our owned lot position, but to do that at an increased closing level requires an increase in investment. Michael J. Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Perfect. That's very helpful. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the backlog conversion ratio, which you guided for, for the first quarter. I think you said 72% to 74%, kind of low to mid-70%s. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Nishu \u2013 Nishu, hang on a second. We guided to 75% to 78%. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, okay. Sorry. Sorry, 75% - Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : I just wanted to make sure everybody got that and didn't write down your 72% to 74%. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sure, sure. No, no, appreciate that. You folks have had eight quarters in a row of your backlog turnover ratio being higher on a year-over-year basis. I mean, that's a terrific achievement in light of the pressure that the industry has been facing and obviously have been discussed here in the Q&A already. This would be the first quarter where you would be down on a year-over-year basis. So I just wanted to understand that a little bit better. Is this just a reflection of the issues that you were discussing, the delivery and the labor challenges? Are you changing in terms of the sort of units that you're building \u2013 less specs, maybe? Just wanted to understand the drivers of it being lower year over year. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Nishu, I think you hit on it. We did touch on some of the factors that are affecting us. There was \u2013 it rained in a lot of places. Not making any excuses for that, but we still looking for next year, the full year, to revenues to be up 10% to 15%. And we're going to see our first quarter conversion rate, we believe, to be a little lower than it was last year. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I think there were 24 inches in - Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : \u2013 24 inches in our major markets in Texas in May. And so we lost about two months of starts, and that's \u2013 we were able to drive the conversion at the end of the year because those houses were started. But it \u2013 right now, today, if we had more houses, we'd be at a higher conversion rate. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : First quarter was our lowest quarter (46:09) Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. So then it's more temporary issues as opposed to changes to operating procedures, such \u2013 let's say building less specs or (46:20) Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Absolutely. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Our primary goal is to continue to improve the efficiency metrics of this industry and of our company. And conversion rate is a major goal for us. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Which is why it was improved eight quarters in a row. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Appreciate that. And then the second question \u2013 and, Jessica, I won't say the number because I'll probably get it wrong again \u2013 but (46:46) I think you guided to in the low 30%s on a margin basis. A lot of folks expected at the beginning of this year the margins in that business, being very high for them, to converge back to normal. From your 4Q, which was very strong, it certainly doesn't look like that's the case. But \u2013 so what are you thinking about when you guide to the financial services margins being down year over year? It doesn't seem like any of the momentum has been lost there. Is that just a view that, look, longer term this doesn't look to be sustainable? Are you seeing anything in your business now which led to the low-30%s expectation? And, yeah \u2013 so what are your thoughts behind that? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Sure. A couple of things, Nishu. Our financial services team has done an outstanding job the last couple of years \u2013 well, and really longer than that \u2013 but the last few years they've seen outsized operating margins as what we would've expected from them historically. They continue to have just better loan sale execution and higher loan amounts this year, which helped them leverage their SG&A better. But we also had a slightly unusual item this year in terms of a $10 million reduction in our loan loss reserve. We were actually successful in some negotiations with mortgage purchasers for amounts lower than we originally anticipated. So we did lower our reserve amount in Q4, and the full-year amount was $10 million. So that was a slight pickup to their margin this year, which we aren't expecting to repeat in 2016, coupled with \u2013 we just don't know if we're going to be able to sustain the higher operating margins that they've been running for the last two years. So they'll continue to operate as efficiently as they can and do as well as they can. And as we move throughout the year we'll update that guidance if that 30% to 33% doesn't look right. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate the thoughts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. Two things. First of all, I think, Jessica, you pointed out that the revenues per foot ahead of the cost per foot, ex-land, for the first time in a while. I guess the two questions in that \u2013 what's changed within that, and is that sustainable? That's the first thing I wanted to ask. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : We'll see if it's sustainable. We're guiding to essentially flat gross margins next year. So that would infer that we do expect labor to continue to be a challenge. But our goal next year is going to be to continue to keep those in line. If we're able to get more pricing and improve our margin as we move throughout the spring, we will. But where we sit today in November, we feel pretty comfortable that we can offset any labor and material and land increases with our sales prices. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Now, the progress with sales price kind of moderated through the year, and I understand there's moving parts within mix. Is there a belief that with a better demand environment, there's more of an opportunity with price in 2016 than you experienced within 2015? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In an improved demand environment, I would say yes. But where demand conditions are today, we feel comfortable at our absorptions and our community levels. And so we have a kind of a balance, if you will, an equilibrium, at the community level we're comfortable guiding to right now. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : And then in terms of our overall ASP, obviously, as Express continues to become a bigger mix, we're not going to expect our ASP to continue to climb at the same rate, because we do have mix impact impacting that as well. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. And then the second question \u2013 I appreciate \u2013 you commented you want to wait to see the spring to determine some of the land spend and some of the overall spend, also talking about growing 20%. I guess from a bigger strategic picture at this point of the cycle, are you still trying to grow the overall inventory, or are you trying to match the spend to what you sell, or are you trying to spend a little less than what you sell? Where are you at this point of the cycle in terms of your investment relative to what you're selling through? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I would say we still think that there's legs left in this cycle. I mean, we're not even close to what is a historical demand. So we're trying to be very judicious and value the capital we have. So I'd say some kind of balance. One quarter, it may look like we're \u2013 didn't buy enough. The next quarter it may look like we bought too much. But it's a balanced approach to drive efficiency throughout the entire company. We don't want too much land. We don't want too little land. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think, Eric, to follow-on what David said that we would expect that to be at a replenishment level to slightly higher. But all the while looking to be more efficient with our capital. More efficient with our inventory to drive a higher turn. A higher backlog conversion, a higher rollover of our assets to be better stewards of that capital. To drive the return on our invested inventory up. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : That's why one of our major goal is to substantially increase our option land position where we're at a balance today at 68% owned. Obviously, our long term, we'd love to be much closer to 50%/50% split there, and so to the extent that we can increase our option position much more efficient with our capital, lower risk as well, we'd like to do that. So it's still a goal. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Good morning, Sue. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : You guys have talked a lot about how you have already expanded Express and sort of the future of that brand. And yet it sounds like the bulk of that business remains focused in Texas and the Carolinas and Florida. As you think about it moving further and getting into increasingly more markets, should we expect that the core will remain focused in those areas, or to what extent do you expect to diversify to these other markets? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we opened 24 new markets with Express in fiscal 2015. That puts us in 48 markets out of the 70-plus we operate in. So - Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Florida was a major entrance this year. And as we add to other markets, we're starting to add markets in the West now, that's adding to our presence. That starts to change the mix a bit, and we'll diversify a bit from where we are. But I think still our long-term expectation is really Texas across the Southeast including the Carolinas and Florida will still remain the core of Express, might even remain the majority of our overall volume. But we do continue to diversify as the rollout continues. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then you saw very strong order trends in the Southeast. Was a lot of that driven by Express? Or can you talk a little bit about what you saw there? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : A lot of it was driven by Express, Sue. We've opened a lot of new communities because of a lot of new investments all across the Southeast in all of our brands. So we saw a very nice pickup in our absorptions, coupled with an increase in our community count that really drove their order increase this quarter. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : But when we look at our home sales revenue on a year-over-year basis across all three of our brands, all three of our brands increased at a strong double-digit pace. Clearly, as we've expanded Express and Emerald, they've grown at a higher percentage as we rolled them out. But all three of our brands grew at a strong double-digit pace. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Wondered if you could put a little context around the absorptions? Obviously, you've seen a companywide improvement. But when I think about Express versus Horton versus Emerald, how should we think about community absorption per brand? Is it like 8-4-2? Is it 10-6? (55:27) Is there a way you can sort of, rule of thumb, give us some context on how to think about that, as a follow-up to the prior question given Express is driving such order growth and absorption improvement? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : It's less about brand than it is about return on investment and the pace of absorption to drive the highest return. It's a balance of margin, sales base, and deliveries. So that's something we look at project by project, market by market to maximize the return to the company and the shareholders. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We have Horton projects doing significant absorption. And it really is all across the board. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. So community by community, not brand by brand? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Yes, sir. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, just as a follow-up to some of the \u2013 it looks like you're going to probably delever further next year. You talk about a cash number that sounds conservative, potentially, next year, and then, you're increasing your option versus your owned to mix presumably as well. Saw the dividend raised this quarter. Where is the right leverage ratio? I know you've bought back stock in the past to offset some dilution. What do you think about buybacks? Just kind of where do you think the balance sheet and capital looks like sort of a year from now from a leverage ratio, and what else do you do with your cash? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We do expect incremental improvement in our leverage, I think, as we move each year into the cycle, I think we think that's prudent, and a prudent management of our balance sheet. So what that gives us is a lot of flexibility. And it gives us the potential to be very opportunistic. So, to the extent that a great opportunity comes along, we've got of plenty of room on our balance sheet and plenty of liquidity to be able to take advantage of it. So, from our standpoint, that's really what we're trying to maintain : this flexibility and the ability to be opportunistic. I talked earlier in one of the responses to the previous question about our priorities for cash flow around we increased our dividend, we're going to continue to invest in the business, and we'll adjust that based on what we see next year. We do expect incremental reduction in our debt. And then past that, our mantra is opportunistic but disciplined. We certainly have done some limited share repurchases in the past. I would say that's not near the top of our list right now given the opportunities that we see to invest in our business and generate a strong return in our business. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : At this point in the cycle, we believe having flexibility and liquidity is a good thing and will give us an opportunity to take advantage of investments that \u2013 we'll be the only one bidding. So we like that environment. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. You guided to 375 million on the share count next year. Is that the right number? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Yes. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. This is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the labor costs, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color on what trades in particular that you have been seeing the most pressures in, and if these labor constraints have been more concentrated to certain markets than others. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ryan. It's David. It depends on the market \u2013 framing labor, Sheetrock labor, electricians, A/C. I mean, every major trade in certain markets have been stretched very, very tight. So \u2013 this is the last weather comment I'll make, that when you can't start a house for two months, concrete, labor, and material becomes very, very tight. So it's a market by market, trade by trade. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then just on the land market, you guided to the 20%-plus incremental spending. Can you just give a bit more color on the growth in the level of competition? We've heard certain peers saying that competition has been decreasing slightly. What markets are currently more attractive than others, and have the labor constraints caused you to change your underwriting on new land purchases? Thanks. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : The labor's not going to impact our \u2013 I mean, we're going to deal with labor, and we're better positioned to deal with it than anybody else. So that's an advantage to us. Where we're going to invest, where we're looking at, it changes quarter to quarter. And right now today, we have markets we're underinvested in and are working hard to drive \u2013 to get a level of investment there that allows us to grow at what we think the market will give us. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Good morning. Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Just one quick question, and, Jessica and Bill, you may laugh. But after reporting a quarter like this and seeing your ratios, can you update us with your conversations, at least, with S&P and Fitch with regards to an IG rating? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly. We have active communications with them, in-person meetings with them as well. And certainly the progress that we're making in our business, the improvement we're showing in our liquidity and in our leverage, are all positive things that rating agencies love to see. From our standpoint, if we continue to improve and continue to show the progress and do what we've said we're going to do, we certainly believe that our metrics and the way we're operating our company are consistent with an investment-grade rating. The actual decision and timing of when that will be is certainly out of our hands. From our standpoint, though, the decision point or the goal of being investment grade isn't the end. What our goal is, is to be in position, and once it has been achieved, that it can be sustained over the long term through the cycles. And so, from our standpoint, when it happens doesn't really matter. It will happen, and it will be sustained. Susan A. Berliner - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Communications : Thanks, Sue. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor over to management for any further or closing comments. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team listening in out there, congratulations on an outstanding year. You are the best in the industry. Thank you for what you do every day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I\u2019m pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team started the year with a strong first quarter, setting us up for a great 2016. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $241 million on $2.4 billion of revenue. And our pre-tax operating margin improved 40 basis points to 10%. Our homes sold increased 9% compared to the first quarter of last year due to improved absorptions. These results reflect a solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry leading market share. We plan to maintain consistent, broad product diversity with our three brands over the long-term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing our returns. With a sales backlog of 10,665 homes at the end of December, positive sales trends in January and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for the spring selling season and for 2016. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Net income for the first quarter increased to 11% to $158 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 9% to $241 million in the first quarter compared to $221 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 11% to $229 million compared to $206 million in the prior year quarter. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 4% to 2.3% -- $2.3 billion on 8,061 homes closed, up from $2.2 billion on $7,973 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,400, up 3% compared to the prior year due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot. This quarter entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 22% of homes closed, and 15% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up, and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. Mike? Michael J. Murray: The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 12% from a year-ago quarter to $2.4 billion and homes sold increased 9% to 8,064 homes on a relatively flat active selling community account. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter increased 3% to $293,700. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 23%, down from 24% in the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 16% from a year-ago to $3.2 billion, with an average sales price per home of $297,600, and homes in backlog increased 15% to 10,665 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was 76%, within the range we guided to on our fourth quarter call. We expect our second quarter backlog conversion rate to be in the range of 82% to 85%. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 19.9%, consistent with the fourth quarter and up 10 basis points from the first quarter of last year. The consistency in our gross margin reflects the stability of most of our markets today. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we\u2019re achieving our target absorptions and we\u2019re also working to control cost increases. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. David? David V. Auld: In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $243 million compared to $238 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenues, SG&A improved 30 basis points to 10.3%, compared to 10.6% in the prior-year quarter. As our revenue increase improved our leverage of fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $12.3 million compared to $14.6 million in the year-ago quarter. 90% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 51% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume, compared to 42% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 714, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First time home buyers represented 43% of the closings handled by our mortgage company compared to 40% in the first quarter last year. Mike? Michael J. Murray: At the end of December, we had 21,500 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 11,300 of our total homes were spec homes, with 7,700 in various stages of construction and 3,600 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $291 million during the quarter, as we prepare for seasonally higher demand in the spring. Our first quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $627 million, an increase of 11% from the first quarter last year. $360 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $262 million was for land development. We expect that our investments in land and development for the full-year of 2016 will be at least 20% greater than fiscal 2015. David? David V. Auld: At December 31, 2015, our portfolio consisted of 178,000 lots, of which 117,000 are owned and 61,000 are controlled through option contracts, which represents a 10% increase in our option position since year-end. 69,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 36,000 are optioned. Our 178,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods. Although our housing inventories will fluctuate as we manage each of our communities to optimize returns, we expect our land and lot inventory to remain relatively stable to slightly higher in 2016, which will result in positive cash flows. In the first quarter, we used $1.5 million of operating cash, an improvement of $128 million compared to the first three months of last year. Mike? Michael J. Murray: During the first quarter, we reported $1.5 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $500,000 of inventory impairment charges. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future charges. But the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate as they have in the past. Our inactive land held for development of $185 million at the end of the quarter represents 10,500 lots, down 24% from a year-ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: At December 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $871 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. We had no cash borrowings and $104 million of letters of credit outstanding on the revolver. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio was 35.5%, and our homebuilding leverage ratio net of cash was 25.7%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31 was $3.3 billion. On January 15, we repaid $170 million of senior notes after maturity and now we\u2019ve $373 million of maturities remaining in fiscal 2016. At December 31, our shareholder's equity was $6.1 billion, and book value per share was $16.39, up 14% from a year-ago. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our expectations for fiscal 2016 remain unchanged from what we shared on our November call and are based on current housing market conditions. We continue to expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax operating margin of 10.5% to 11% for fiscal 2016. We also still expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion and to close between 39,500 and 41,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full-year of 2016 will be in the high 19%s to 20%, with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate that our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be in the range of 9.2% to 9.4% of homebuilding revenues, with the second quarter of the year higher than this range and the third and fourth quarters below the range. We expect our annual financial services operating margin to range from 30% to 33%. We are forecasting our fiscal 2016 income tax rate to be between 35% and 36%, and our diluted share count to be approximately 375 million shares. We also continue to expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations. Our fiscal 2016 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we will update our expectations each quarter as visibility to the spring and full-year becomes clearer. For the second fiscal quarter of 2016, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 82% to 85%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the high 19%s to 20%, consistent with the first quarter and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.6% of homebuilding revenues. David? David V. Auld: In closing, our first quarter growth in sales and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax margin are the result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are excited and prepared for the spring selling season and opportunities ahead. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profit at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet; industry-leading market share; broad geographic footprint; diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land positions; and, most importantly, our tremendous team across the country. We would like to thank all of our employees for the continued hard work and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations during 2016. Let\u2019s keep the momentum from January going, week-by-week into the spring. This concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you and thank you for all of the details as well. First question I wanted to ask, the tone that you are describing to begin the year is pretty positive. You mentioned January orders being positive. That\u2019s -- that could imply a pretty broad range, so I was wondering if you could be more specific? And more broadly, the tone that you\u2019re describing, it sounds like it is sufficient to -- the absorption momentum is sufficient to meet your revenue and closing expectations for the year. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that as well please. David V. Auld: Well, we\u2019ve a positive tone, because we\u2019re seeing positive things happen out in the market. And with the absorptions improvement on the relatively flat community count, less pressure on margins, it was a good first quarter, and what we\u2019re seeing going into January gives us a lot of confidence. Bill W. Wheat: And Nishu just to share -- just a little bit more about January, we\u2019re seeing week-by-week accelerating sales pace as we\u2019d expect to see in January and certainly consistent with typical seasonality and certainly in line with our expectations and our budget. So we\u2019re feeling good about what we\u2019re seeing so far, what we produced in the first quarter, sales we\u2019re seeing so far in January are right in line with our plans and certainly is sufficient to generate the volume that we\u2019re guiding too for the year. Nishu Sood : Great. Thanks. And second question, you folks have had a strategy of being more capital efficient, focusing on return of inventory, call with the past 12 or 18 months or so. You\u2019ve clearly been successful with that, judging from the amount of cash and liquidity that you\u2019ve at the moment. So normally a build up of cash like this is the way that you would behave, if you\u2019re expecting a downturn in the market, or if you were trying to batten down the hatches. So without an increase in the dividend or a share buyback, what are your thoughts here, and is that characterization correct? I mean, how can you be drawing back inventory when we still have 50% to 60% upside potential in single-family volumes going forward? David V. Auld: Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re drawing back inventory. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re guiding, I think, this year to be up 15%, 20% and what we\u2019re pushing out. Bill W. Wheat: Spending, yes. David V. Auld: Spending, yes. So the focus on efficiency gains and returns, I think are have little to do with what we\u2019re thinking about whether the market is going to be good or bad. It has a lot to do with, I think, driving to become the best Company in the industry. And the liquidity and strong balance sheet gives us a lot of flexibility and we will see what we do with the cash. I mean, it\u2019s \u2026 Bill W. Wheat: Nishu, we still see opportunities to invest in the business. We still do expect our land spend to be up -- land and development spend to be up 20% this year. We\u2019re continuing to add lots under option contracts and control for future growth in that direction. But as David said, continuing to drive a more efficient business model for our self helps us improve our operational disciplines across the board. And that\u2019s been a consistent focus we\u2019ll have with this Company for a long time and we are seeing a lot of this results bearing fruit right now. And we will be looking to pay off debt with the existing cash. We just paid off, I think, $170 million in January and we\u2019ve another maturity in April of $370 million. Nishu Sood : Okay. Bill W. Wheat: So, we feel real good about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning, guys. David, could you just talk a little bit -- obviously we are getting a lot of questions about Texas and what\u2019s happening with oil. Could you talk a little bit, sort of rank order your cities as far as the percentage of your business? And maybe talk a little bit about the demand trends that you are seeing and where you all are investing within the state either -- well I\u2019m looking at, not only investing in communities, but also are you targeting either Express, or Emerald or it was pretty much across the board? David V. Auld: Stephen, pretty much across the board on what we\u2019re targeting pushing out. The Express has been the driver, I think of market share gains, but Texas is in good shape. I\u2019ve spend the last two weeks driving the Dallas Fort Worth areas and I can tell you, if you can put a house in Texas and pretty much any market and sell it to make a margin at 250, you\u2019re going to sell houses. So we\u2019re focused on improving the value of the customer. We are focused on driving absorption levels up on a community-by-community basis and that has been a successful strategy for us in Texas. Whereas revenues and by cities, yes number one, Dallas Fort Worth, like we\u2019re 15% of the market share today. And to be honest with you, we believe we can expand that. So we love Texas. Stephen East : All right. David V. Auld: We really love our operators in Texas. Stephen East : Okay. And if I can just follow on the capital allocation that you talked about, your land and development be up about 20%? Did I understand you right, Mike, that your 370 this spring, you will actually pay that off? And then, as you look at M&A, one, what are you seeing out there, and what\u2019s your appetite for it? Michael J. Murray: So we will with the 370 maturing, we\u2019ve adequate cash to pay that off today. And to be opportunistic if we look at any portion, some or all that in a refinancing depending upon where the markets look like and timing to hit that. With M&A, we continue to be very included, if you will, and look at a lot of opportunities. Borrowers pretty high for us and looking at acquisitions that make sense. We\u2019ve a great footprint today. We have good operations, and adding on to that is a high bar. So we are -- we would be very disciplined with on the M&A front. Stephen East : Okay. Is the activity picked up? Michael J. Murray: It\u2019s been running at a very high pace in terms of lots of activity for a while. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s picked up in the past quarter. It\u2019s been running at a good clip. Stephen East : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Hey, guys. Good quarter. Lots of interesting things going on. I guess, the first question I had relates to what you are seeing with respect to the first time buyer activity and I know that at least in the entry level side as long as you to the degree those things kind of go hand-in-hand you all have been kind of leading the market with your express, but the data we look at shows that beginning in April of last year the first time buyer activity is markedly improved is now up nearly 20% year-on-year and yet, we\u2019re still not seeing your competitors indicating that they are seeing insufficient activity out there to warrant them going out there, so it\u2019s quite an unusual situation where you really seem to have that end of the market kind of to yourselves and so I guess I would just say can you shed a little light on A) are you in fact feeling a pick up in the market at the first time buyer area or second in the market since the Summer of last year. Did you -- have you seen that and B) do you have anymore current thinking as to how the competitive dynamics addressing that market may change or not in \u201916. David V. Auld: Well as far as the market picking up, as we continue to push out the Express brand, we\u2019re continuing to see consistent absorption and demand. So we\u2019re in the process of pushing that brand out across the country and everywhere we\u2019ve gone, we\u2019ve seen good absorption and margins at or above what we underwrote them at. Michael J. Murray: To the competitive landscape certainly the entry level the lower end of the market is certainly the strongest right now and any time we see that in the market we expect further competition. You are right, we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot in a lot of our Markets, we probably haven't seen as much as we expected, but we do expect more as time goes on. Stephen Kim : Great and then touching back on this interesting just position of strong of cash flow generation next year which is an unusual thing and usually doesn\u2019t happen early in a cycle, with your fairly optimistic commentary about the market and your position within it. I would just point out that your comment about a 20% increase in land spend next year would still employ a very low ratio relative to revenues which is just essentially you\u2019re basically barely replenishing what you are burning off in terms of dollars invested in land, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Just that I would just point out, but that does still -- it sounds to me even though you are capturing that in terms to make it sound like you are sort of leaning forward on land investment. It actually isn\u2019t. It sounds to me like on balance you are being relatively judicious, very judicious actually historically in your land spend next year. And so I guess I\u2019m curious as to touching on what you\u2019ve said in the past. What you intend to do with the cash that you\u2019re going to be building here over the course of the next year? Do you for instance envision using that more for debt pay down, share repurchases, M&A, over the course of the next two to three years? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, Steven, first to your comment about this, replenishing our land supply. We feel very good about the level of our land supply in terms of what we own and we\u2019re that the 20% or greater spend that we\u2019re essentially expecting. Does replenish our land supply. We thought that is a sufficient level to support the growth expectations and guidance that we have provided, but we\u2019ve provided, but we\u2019re definitely taking a balanced approach, and keeping the investment levels within a disciplined range. And with that, that\u2019s definitely generating a lot of cash flow, as far as how we look at our cash positions today, we talked a bit about our debt -- debt maturities, to the extend the market is favorable. We would still issue new debt, to refinance rates are still certainly very attractive. And we continue to look for investments in our business. We see great investments that would push our lands spending up to 25% or 30%. We feel like a generator great return. We will do that and as Michael already talked about M&A, there are a lot of opportunities and hopefully there will be some come along that meet our threshold and this cash position puts us in a great flexible opportunistic position to be able to take advantage of that. And so today in terms of priorities, we\u2019d list investing in our business, which would include potential M&A. Taking care of our debt maturity is a long way as our top priorities and beyond that we\u2019re going to remind in a flexible and opportunistic position for the next year. Stephen Kim : Well it\u2019s a good position to be in, so congratulations for putting yourselves in that position, thanks. Bill W. Wheat: Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hi, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. First question is on the spec [indiscernible] homes. if I think, I\u2019m looking at the right number here, it looks like year-over-year you are down roughly 20% on completed specs, 10% on total and yes, I think that you are expecting relatively lower growth this year than last year but is there any conservatism baked in there just given some of the macro uncertainties we are seeing now where maybe just talk a little bit about the thought process and where you see your spec count heading into the selling season? David V. Auld: I would -- this is David. I would say no baked in. We are attempting to continue to do what we\u2019ve been doing which is consolidate market share in a market-by-market program. We are measuring and trying to control the finished inventory and keep it turning, because that drives SG&A leverage and it also drives significant efficiencies in the operations, so \u2026 Bill W. Wheat: We feel like we are in a good position for the spring, started a lot of houses in the first quarter, we\u2019re going to start with a lot of houses in the Second Quarter to feed the sales that we expect, but with that just like we are with the land we are remaining disciplined community by community and so I think we\u2019ve gotten a bit more efficient with turning our specs over the last year. Alan Ratner : Great. Thanks for that and second follow-up if I could, it sounds like you guys are pretty bullish on the January activity. I think the big concern that investors have is that the stock market volatility here is going to maybe more at the higher end cause some skittishness among buyers there so, given your diversification on the product side, have you seen any differences in buyer activity between your Emerald division and maybe down to the Express division or are the comments you had company-wide pretty consistent from price point? David V. Auld: Actually pretty consistent. There is a slower movement on the Emerald, the higher price points are not seeing the same levels of activity that we are seeing in the Horton or the Express brands. Alan Ratner : Is that a rate of change comment meaning it slowed over the last month or two or is that just generally speaking you will get lower absorptions which I think would be expected? David V. Auld: I\u2019d say rate of change over the last couple of quarters. I can tell you right now January started off very good. Alan Ratner : Great, well thanks a lot and thanks for taking the questions. Bill W. Wheat: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. In terms of Express, just curious what you are seeing in the market and how you are managing that in terms of price points and also the mix of that product that\u2019s obviously been successful. But curious how you are managing that and how you are seeing the behavior of the first time or that home buyer evolving in this market. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Eric. As David mentioned we\u2019ve been very pleased with the rollout of Express. We\u2019ve talked to you for several quarters that the majority of that business has been in Texas, the Carolinas, and Florida. That\u2019s still the case, the majority of our sales and closings are coming out of those Markets, but we are starting to see a more meaningful share from some other parts of the country and the next largest State for us actually right now is California and the majority of that\u2019s in our Southern California Markets and that is bringing our average price point for Express up. This quarter it was $199,000 dollars and so next in the quarter, more than likely we will be over the $200,000 mark with our Express homes product offering, but really just due to geographic mix and we\u2019ve been very pleased with the rollout of Express in those other markets, in addition to Texas, Carolinas and Florida where the reception still remains very strong. Eric Bosshard : In terms of intentionality of how the product is moving in existing Markets and I appreciate the California expansion, but is there anything that is different either from a price or cost or efficiency standpoint that\u2019s materially different than where it\u2019s been or in terms of where it\u2019s going? David V. Auld: I would say pretty consistent with where it\u2019s been, and we\u2019re going to drive where it\u2019s going. So the Express program is price point driven. So we set absorption targets and drive to that price point. So its -- we\u2019re -- I just -- the overall Express program has been well received and continues to exceed what we thought it would be when it came out. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly in terms of your expectations for price or incentives and obviously you\u2019re going to wait to see how the spring sell in season develops. But could you speak a little bit to what Plan A looks like in regards to that relative to a year ago? Michael J. Murray: I think what we\u2019re seeing with good absorption in the communities, its taking pressure off of the margins and its giving us in certain communities little bit of pricing power to reduce incentives, and that\u2019s been showing up positively in margins. We plan to continue that. The Plan A is to maintain the absorption pace that we budgeted for the year, and we\u2019re seeing the market being very cooperative to that. Eric Bosshard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on a solid quarter. David V. Auld: Thank you, Michael. Michael J. Murray: Thank you. Michael Rehaut : The first question I had was, just trying to drill down a little bit across the regions from the order growth perspective during the quarter, where you had for example, some deceleration in year-over-year order growth. I guess across the board but more notably in the south east still very strong at 22% growth versus, but that was versus a stronger rate in \u201915, couple of smaller regions fell off as well. So I was hoping to get any kind of color across the regions in terms of perhaps highlighting which markets right now that you might see is being stronger than others? And if there was any particular changes in community count growth that might have driven some of those regional changes quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year trend? Jessica Hansen : We saw an increase in our absorptions in every region Mike, outside of the mid-west. And the mid-west is a very small region for us and it does include Chicago which we pointed to for a while now is being a weaker market of ours, but otherwise every region in terms of sales on a year-over-year basis was up, as we did see a decline in our community count in half of our regions. And as we noted already our count -- community count was relatively flat. It was up just only slightly at about 1% on a year-over-year basis. So we\u2019re seeing a good pick up in absorptions in a majority of our markets today I would say. Michael Rehaut : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess, secondly just from the growth side, I think there\u2019s been a couple of questions previously around growth expectations, and your land spend up but kind of keeping your lot count flat and basically replacing what you\u2019re working through. Just thinking at the same time you\u2019re expecting I believe you said double digit growth, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that\u2019s your goal over the next two or three years. So how are you at least from a revenue or order growth standpoint now with community count flattish for three quarters maybe for another couple of quarters here; is growth something that would be re-infused into the strategy as we think about fiscal \u201917 and \u201918. Obviously you\u2019re also creating a lot of dry powder here, building up the cash or paying down some debt incrementally. And it seems like there is a little bit of one foot on the pedal or half way on the gas pedal whereas again you\u2019re still well below mid cycle levels as an industry. So any thoughts around perhaps a reacceleration of that community count growth as we look into \u201917 or \u201918? David V. Auld: I think we\u2019re looking for to continue, to aggregate market share market-by-market. I think we\u2019re looking at double digit growth year-over-year and profit sales and closing. So its -- we get what we believe is a sustainable program and the fact that we\u2019re generating cash and improving our balance sheet while gaining efficiency. It\u2019s just going to open a lot of opportunities for us down the road. Bill W. Wheat: And growth is a core part of that strategy. Growth at a double digit pace is a core part of that strategy but it is a balance strategy. Our guidance for this year in terms of top line revenue equates to 11% to 15% annual increase. Our closings guidance for the year equates to an 8% to 13% increase. And so our expectations this year are to be in the low double digit range which from our perspective is solid growth and in line with our expectations, and this quarter with our sales pace it\u2019s in the range of our expectations for the year and certainly puts us in position to continue a consistent growth. Our investment levels, we\u2019ve gotten a lot of our growth the last couple of years from absorption improvements with the Express roll out while our average community count has moderated. Our expectations this year is well we\u2019ll still see absorption improvements. It won't be quite at the pace it was in prior years but we still expect solid absorption improvements. And then certainly going forward when we achieve a much better level of efficiency then perhaps in future growth at a double digit pace may come from some further community count growth. But today and for this year we expect low -- flat to low single digit of community count growth with improved absorptions to drive a double digit revenue growth. Michael Rehaut : That\u2019s helpful, Bill. And I think just maybe to press that further that concept in terms of the shift between community count and absorption that\u2019s occurred in the last six, eight quarters. This year again it looks like perhaps a high single digit or so perhaps low double digit absorption growth with more flattish community count. To the extent that you\u2019re coming that that growth would continue to moderate perhaps due to the mix shift more fully playing out from the Express standpoint, to the extent that you\u2019re expecting double digit growth in \u201917, it would imply to the extent that the absorption continues to moderate some reacceleration in community count. Is that fair? Bill W. Wheat: I believe that\u2019s fair. Yes. David V. Auld: Yes. Michael Rehaut : All right. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, all. Bill W. Wheat: Good morning, Ken. David V. Auld: Good morning. Kenneth Zener : I wonder if you could talk about the 60% of your buyers that are not first time. Obviously it appears that there was volatility on the existing home sales number in December, some of that mortgage related but it does seem that things are decelerating a little bit on the existing side. Is there anything that would cause you concern or David, Bill, could you kind of talk about what a gumming up of that existing side might look like and how that might concern you. I know obviously Houston is starting to see rising inventory of existing and slowing existing sales. Have you started seeing in any of the markets issues with people not being able to sell their houses or anything? So that was a big part of the market last year when it started to slow down. David V. Auld: I\u2019ll tell you Ken, we\u2019re not seeing that in the markets we\u2019re operating at. The resale market is still relatively strong with continuing positive signs, so I mean, our inventory turns are improving, our absorption per flag are improving with stable and in some cases improving margins. So we feel very good about the market right now, and are not seeing other than obviously Houston slow, but the balance of our markets are doing very, very well. Kenneth Zener : And then if I could ask about California where you did highlight your some Express product, Jessica you talked about lifting your ASP, and then also as it relates to any of your other product. What percent of those homes do you believe are going to or towards investors be it, if you can split out domestic and/or international? Thank you. David V. Auld: We don't have an exact breakdown of the investors. Anecdotally I'd tell you it's very low what we are hearing about any investor sales. A lot of its just people that are moving out of a rental situation into a home that they can afford. Kenneth Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall : Hi, good morning. Did you guys get any help with the December weather to that extent, the construction season and assist with deliveries in Q4? David V. Auld: We had real weather in the fourth quarter in a couple of our bigger markets, across the Carolinas and really Dallas Fort Worth. But as Mike points out we have weather every quarter. So would our numbers have been better with typical weather? Yes, they would have been. But we're very happy with the numbers we posted, and I think we're going to have a great year. Robert Wetenhall : It sounds like and especially with the start; ASP was at 3.3% and average price growth at 2.7% on the new order side. And you're talking about maintaining 19.5% to 20% gross margin. I'm just trying to get a better picture of how to think about prices being low single digit, what you're seeing on the labor cost side and if you're experiencing any delays due to labor bottlenecks and if that's been resolved. What's really giving you the confidence to reiterate your guidance for a very solid margin performance this year? Thanks very much. David V. Auld: I think the confidence is coming from being in touch with the operators out in the divisions, and what they sense and what they feel is taking place in their markets. And across the board, our people feel very good about what's happening out there. The labor side, I would say it's still stressed, but seems to be improving, and the trade bases are starting to add people. I think a big part of the improvement we're seeing is the consistency of production in the community-by-community is allowing these trades to staff and maintain a workforce to hit those numbers. And it\u2019s taken awhile to get there, but they are adding people. I think our trade base is seeing -- is becoming more and more confident as well. Jessica Hansen : And Bob in terms of what we saw in price changes, our revenues per square foot outpaced our stick and brick per square foot on a year-over-year basis for the second time, so we've gotten to where that's in check. Sequentially that was essentially net neutral so you saw our margin pick up by 10 basis points year-over-year, and stays flat from Q4 to Q1. We are continuing to experience higher land costs, but in about the same range year-over-year as we were last quarter. So flat gross margins. Robert Wetenhall : And let me ask you Jessica, just on that point, are you really getting price or is the driver really a reflection of a stronger mix with the buyers towards the west coast? Jessica Hansen : We\u2019re actually getting price. If we look at our price per square foot which is the best way we can try to look at our business apples-to-apples, we did see a low single digit increase. Robert Wetenhall : Got it. And if I could sneak one final in; can you just give us like a way to think about Houston versus Dallas, in the sense that, it sounds like Dallas is very strong. You said Houston is soft. How do we think about that? Is there any more of a bookend you can give us? Thanks a lot. David V. Auld: I would tell you, Bob, I spent a week drive in Dallas and a week drive in Forth Worth in January. And when I got back I told Horton I had to get out of the field, because if I stayed in Dallas and Forth Worth, I would become way too aggressive buying land. It is a go to market as I\u2019ve seen. And as to Houston, I think that there\u2019s a lot of conversation, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility within the oil and gas business, which I think is making people more conservative about buying homes. I think there\u2019s still pent up demand in Houston, I think that pent up demand is growing. But it is just not the frenzy that we\u2019ve seen in the past or is really taking place in some of the other Texas markets. Robert Wetenhall : Super. Good. Good luck, and thanks very much. David V. Auld: Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless : Thank you. If I could, or I can touch on the labor issue, I think some people are concerned about would there be enough labor to make the number of closings in the back half of the year, that your guidance suggest. Could you talk I mean, when you talk about labor getting better and the subs adding more people, is it across the board or is it just in specific market or specific areas like framing et cetera? David V. Auld: It\u2019s pretty much across the board. I mean, we\u2019re seeing the construction labor force increase, and I think our strive to create more efficiency in the process of building, selling homes and trying to actually take some labor out of a per foot, square foot cost of the home has paid off. And our trays are making money and we\u2019re seeing less pressure on the cost side, and I think providing more value for the customer. So we feel like we are positioned to deliver our year. Jay McCanless : Okay. Great. And then the second question I had, on Express; could you just update us on how many markets you ultimately want to go to with that product and how far long do you think you are in that process? David V. Auld: I think there are probably, we\u2019re in 78 markets. We probably will end up mid 60\u2019s primarily because some markets just don\u2019t. We don\u2019t allow you to do a market with your product and we\u2019re not going to give up the Horton brand to sell Express. We have a lot of opportunities still to increase our position within most of the markets, and are actively out there looking every day to do that. Jay McCanless : Okay. And how far along do you think you\u2019re in that process? David V. Auld: Maybe halfway. Jessica Hansen : We\u2019re in 48 markets and 15 states today. But to echo David\u2019s comments, we haven\u2019t fully saturated the markets that we\u2019re currently in with Express. So there\u2019s more runway within those 48 plus expanding to the mid 60s. Jay McCanless : Got it. Thanks. David V. Auld: I mean, we\u2019re allocating capital to the programs that are driving the best returns. And right now, Express is driving great returns. Jay McCanless : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael Dahl : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. David V. Auld: You bet. Michael Dahl : David, if we could go back and put a finer point on the Texas discussion, it sounds like Dallas is clearly very strong, and if I look at your south central trends overall up 7% in orders, Dallas presumably outpacing that by a decent degree. So, Houston can you give us a ballpark around year-over-year what Houston is doing? And we\u2019ve heard some other builders talk about the weakness extending down to the 250K price point. I know you said earlier, you put up -- if you can put up a home at 250 you can sell it. But is there just any additional color on trends that across the price segmentation within your Houston business that you can provide? Jessica Hansen : Houston has been relatively stable for us on a year-over-year basis. So we didn\u2019t see a further slowdown in Houston, but we\u2019re often not seeing any meaningful pickup. We continue to see our lower priced Express homes, very steady demand, steady sales pace that has been mentioned a couple of times on the call. It\u2019s definitely softer at the higher end. But we continue to see good, steady demand for the entry level and people moving out of apartments where we\u2019re providing an attractive rent versus buy equation and driving people into the sales offices each week. So we continue to have a close eye on Houston. We are not heavily reinvesting in Houston right now. We are replenishing where it makes sense and where we can continue to add those entry level product offerings. David V. Auld: And Michael, just to add a little more color. We have some, what I would call A plus project location positions in Houston that or maybe at the price point that we\u2019re seeing less demand for. And we\u2019re not going to accelerate or liquidate those positions, so we will see lower absorptions in those communities. And these are, they are communities we can't go replace and don\u2019t want to. So its -- we\u2019re going to protect the value and our core projects, take absorption at the 250 to 300 range. And if you\u2019re looking at what I look at, almost zero margin deterioration on the projects that are at the price point that are turning right now. And we don\u2019t nor do we want to force sales in a core project where we have been selling 350 to 450 and are just seeing our absorptions reduce. That\u2019s my color on Houston. I think probably, always going to be a tremendous market for us for a long time. Michael Dahl : I guess just a follow-up on that last point. As you take a step back and say, look there is too much value in some of these A plus locations, to give them away. We have heard increased chatter in terms that competitors are starting to cut prices or kick up incentives. So how much of it is related to the market is trading away from you, and you\u2019re not chasing it but the market has moved on price. David V. Auld: We are very strong in the -- I mean, we dominate the 250 to 300 -- 200 to 300 price point in Houston, and we\u2019re going to continue to dominate that. And if you look at our, the benefit, one of the many benefits of being in the orders of broad geographic footprint when the upper end in Houston slows down, the entry level in Denver accelerates. So, I mean, we have a lot of leverage to pull. My consistent comment to the people inside of the company is, it\u2019s going to be us. Because we can hit our plan and without being forced to sell a project we don\u2019t want to sell at the pace that its being running at. Michael Dahl : Got it. That is helpful, and yes good position to be in. If I could shift gears to yet another earlier discussion around community count and absorptions and just as it relates to the guide, I think you mentioned unit deliveries up 8% to 13%. If we looked at the orders, it seems like absorptions are up about 8%. How much of the delta between hitting the low end versus the high end of the units will come from increasing your absorption beyond that 8% on a year-over-year basis versus getting more communities open and getting that community count up into a low to mid single digit range by the end of the year? David V. Auld: We\u2019re pretty much running on our absorption targets. So, I think we will, as we continue to push up the Express brand and follow up replacing the Horton positions, I think we will see some community count growth. We don\u2019t have visibility in that today. We do have visibility in what we know we can deliver. Michael J. Murray: It\u2019s hard to know exactly where the contributions are sitting here in January not knowing what the spring is doing the whole. We\u2019re certainly seeing good early signs, but clearly the strength of the spring selling season will help determine our year, it will determine where we land in our range or whether we could perhaps exceed our range, so it\u2019s here in January, feeling good. We feel good about our position, our preparations for the spring, and then we\u2019ll go try to execute as best we can over the next few months, and we\u2019ll know a whole lot more when we talk to you next quarter. Michael Dahl : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randall from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. William Randall : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. David V. Auld: Good morning, Will. William Randall : Hello. I was curious on the implementation of The Know Before You Owe or Trade If You will. For you guys how that look like? How do you feel about I guess for lack of a better term the complexity as well as days its added to closings, and if you would share some color there? Bill W. Wheat: We really haven\u2019t seen an appreciable impact in a delay in closings. Our teams have worked very hard to prepare for the changing rules and worked with our captain mortgage company, GHM Mortgage those folks have done a yeoman\u2019s job preparing for this change as well as working with our preferred lenders. So we really didn\u2019t see a material impact on our closings for the quarter. We\u2019ll continue to improve our processes and try to become more efficient and make it a good experience for the buyers. William Randall : Thanks for that. And then just as a follow-up, it was talked about a few times during Q&A. But on labor inflation, I think you guys are running at 2% to 3% in the prior reported quarter, well some of your competitors out there are running closer to 10%. Have you seen more inflation and has that been different for specs versus the total company? David V. Auld: I think the labor side has been minimized for us because we set absorption targets per community and drive to that. So we have consistency within the communities. And our trades are not out there looking for work one-week and then add twice what they can do the next. Jessica Hansen : And we are still just running a low single digit percentage increase on cost per square foot, stick and brick. William Randall : All right. Thanks for that, and congrats on the progress. David V. Auld: Thank you. Bill W. Wheat: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. First question is on the financial services margin, we have it at about 16% I think in the quarter versus the guide of 30% to 33%. Now was there any trade related expenses kind of lumped in there in the quarter? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, no doubt. To be prepared for the new regulations are our mortgage company financial services operation had to make significant investments primarily in personal. The effort to comply is a big one and in order to meet those regulations and provide that experience to the home buyers they\u2019ve had to increase cost there. Typically those from a seasonal basis we see our lower operating margins in our first and second quarters and our lower volume quarters, and then we typically see higher than average operating margins and financial services in Q3 and Q4. And so, the margin here this quarter in the low 20s certainly does not preclude achieving the 30% to 33% guidance for the year. John Lovallo : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the one follow-up would be, realizing that weather is an issue every quarter somewhere. The recent weather we\u2019ve had on the east coast is, has been pretty serious, particularly in areas like Carolina they aren\u2019t used to having that kind of impact. So I mean, are you guys anticipating any trouble in the coming quarter due to the storm? Bill W. Wheat: Certainly do appreciate it. It has been a serious storm. It\u2019s impacted a lot of people. But we feel its fortunate it\u2019s early in our quarter, and our operating teams will be able to take care of our existing home owners in the communities and deal with the homes that are in backlog and the specs that are out there today, and be ready for sales next weekend. David V. Auld: And I\u2019d also like to add, it\u2019s a beautiful day in Texas today. So, sun is shining on somebody somewhere everyday. Bill W. Wheat: So buy a house in Texas. John Lovallo : All right. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. David V. Auld: Good morning. Susan Maklari : You have talked frequently about how you just not seen a lot of competition coming in to the sort of first time Express kind of price point. What you think is the biggest factor that would have to change, either from an operating kind of industry perspective or from a macro perspective that would finally push some of those years, maybe perhaps come in and kind of create a bit more competition for you there? David V. Auld: Well, I don\u2019t -- we have a hard and tough time managing our people. I don\u2019t want to get into trying to help them help themselves. So I don\u2019t know. And all we do is, get up every day and operate and pursue to be the best we can be. I think we\u2019re tough competition. Maybe they just -- I don\u2019t know. Michael J. Murray: But entry level housing is something we\u2019ve done for a very long time. It\u2019s a core competency of our business. And with our footprint and with that competency among our operating teams across the country, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve -- we got a lot of practice at. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re focused on, and like we said earlier, it\u2019s a good market and there\u2019s a lot of demand there. We do expect some more competition down the line, and I think that would be a natural next step in the cycle. David V. Auld: I will say, we were first movers, and we were aggressive first movers. And I would believe that, the other companies that are also good at driving value will be following us in it. But then we bought the lion share of the finish lots and when we saw all those success, we started investment, investing in development -- developing lots of -- we just have a head start and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re coming. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then just, following up on TRID, obviously TRID has done a great job in rolling that out. But as we do get into the spring and just started just the overall activity levels that we reached, could you see anything out there that have started to trip things up at all? Michael J. Murray: Well the area that we\u2019ve watched the most closely that we have less visibility too or the closings with outside lenders, obviously our internal mortgage company, our captive closings that we have more visibility in that process and feel confident about that. But with outside lenders it\u2019s something we watch closely division-by-division where they have relationships with outside lenders. They\u2019re working with them to make sure that we had the visibility to hit things on time, but I think that\u2019s where the greater risk is. But I honestly think month-by-month as everyone in the process gets more used to it, I think it will get smoother and any disruptions that may have occurred thus far, I think will be alleviated over the coming months. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David V. Auld: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time today and look forward to speaking with you again in April. Again, special thanks to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding first quarter, outstanding start to the year. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

The supplementary information includes historical data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The spring selling season at D.R. Horton is in full swing and our team delivered a set \u2013 a strong second quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $301 million on $2.8 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax profit margin improved 130 basis points to 10.9%. Our homes sold increased 10% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by improving absorptions. These results continue to reflect the consistent solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We plan to maintain broad product diversity with our three brands over the long-term. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the six months ended March, we generated $27 million of cash from operations, on track to meet our target of $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows for the year. Our return on inventory defined as homebuilding pre-tax income divided by average inventory, improved to 13.8% for the 12 months, up from 10.7% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 13,695 homes at the end of March and a well-stocked supply of land, lots, and homes, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2016. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Net income for the second quarter increased 32% to $195 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $148 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 31% to $301 million in the second quarter, compared to $230 million in the year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 36% to $283 million, compared to $209 million in the prior year quarter. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 16% to $2.7 billion on 9,262 homes closed, up from $2.3 billion on 8,243 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,000, up 3% compared to the prior year and flat sequentially from our first quarter. This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 23% of homes closed and 16% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 accounted for 7% of our homes closed and 17% of our home sales revenue. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $3.6 billion, and home sold increased 10% to 12,292 homes on a relatively flat active selling community count. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $290,900. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19%, consistent with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 14% from a year ago to $4.1 billion, with an average sales price per home of $296,700 and homes in backlog increased 12% to 13,695 homes. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 19.9%, consistent with the first quarter and up 20 basis points from the second quarter of last year. The consistency in our gross margin reflects a stability of most of our markets today. We are raising prices or reducing incentives when possible in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. And we're also working to control cost increases. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to generally be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. As a reminder, our reported gross margins include all of our interest costs. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $258 million, compared to $242 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 80 basis points to 9.6%, compared to 10.4% in the prior year quarter, as our revenue increase improved our leverage of fixed overhead cost. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Financial Services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $17.4 million, compared to $21.5 million in the year-ago quarter. 94% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 53% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 45% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 717 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, compared to 43% in the second quarter last year. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : At the end of March, we had 24,600 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 11,700 of our total homes were spec homes, with 8,400 in various stages of construction and 3,300 completed. Our construction in progress and finished homes inventory increased by $361 million during the quarter due to seasonal construction activity for the spring selling season. Our second-quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $500 million, of which $271 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $229 million was for land development. We expect our investments in land and development to increase in the third and fourth quarters compared to the second quarter this year. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : At March 31, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 189,000 lots, of which 112,000 are owned and 77,000 are controlled through option contracts. 69,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 31,000 are owned and 38,000 are optioned. Our 189,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods. Although our housing inventories will fluctuate as we manage each of our communities to optimize returns, we expect our land and lot inventories to remain relatively stable in 2016. We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for the second consecutive year through increased profitability and disciplined inventory management. During the six months ended March, we generated $27 million of operating cash, an improvement of $196 million, compared to the same period last year. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : During the second quarter, we recorded $2.8 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded a $3.2 million inventory impairment charge in our East region related to a long-held, inactive land parcel that we sold during the quarter. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment which may result in future charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate. Our inactive land held for development of $194 million at the end of the quarter represents 10,100 lots, down 22% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns, and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : At March 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.2 billion unrestricted homebuilding cash and $884 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our gross homebuilding leverage ratio improved 580 basis points from a year ago to 33.6%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at March 31 was $3.2 million. On April 15, we repaid $373 million of senior notes at their maturity and we have no debt maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31, our shareholders' equity was $6.2 billion and book value per share was $16.85, up 14% from a year ago. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : We are updating our expectations for our fiscal 2016 profitability based on current housing market conditions and our financial performance to date this year. As we noted in our press release this morning, we're increasing our annual guidance for consolidated pre-tax profit margin by 20 basis points to a range of 10.7% to 11.2% for fiscal 2016. We are also updating our annual guidance for homebuilding SG&A to a range of 9% to 9.2% of homebuilding revenues from the previous range of 9.2% to 9.4%. Also as outlined in our press release this morning, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance for fiscal 2016 as follows : Consolidated revenues of between $12 billion and $12.5 billion, homes closed between 39,500 and 41,500 homes, our home sales gross margin for the full year of 2016 in the high 19% to 20%, and annual Financial Services pre-tax profit margin of 30% to 33%, and income tax rate for the full year of between 35% and 36%, and annual diluted share count of approximately 375 million shares and $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations for fiscal 2016. Specifically, for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 76% to 80%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be in a high 19% to 20% consistent with the first half of the year, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in a range of 8.9% to 9.1% of homebuilding revenues. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : In closing, our second quarter growth in sales, closings and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax profit margin are the result of the strength of our people and our operating platform. We remain excited and are looking forward to the opportunities ahead. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improve returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands; attractive finished lot and land position; and most importantly, our tremendous team across the country. We would like to thank our entire D.R. Horton team for their continued hard work, and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operation. Let's keep the momentum going week-by-week, flag-by-flag throughout this year. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now hold questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI : Thank you. This is actually Paul Przybylski on for Stephen. I'm impressed with the first half cash flow generation given that's typically a period of heavy spend. What's the sustainability of that going out? I know you're looking for the $300 million to $500 million for the year. But should we expect first half cash generation in out-years? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. That's hard to say in future years, Paul. For this year, we are on track based on our current plans for fiscal 2016 to generate $300 million to $500 million for the full year. We would not be surprised that in Q3, we used cash because we are building out our backlog, building out our homes and construction. And as we stated, we do expect our land and lot investments to be higher in Q3 and Q4 than it was this quarter, but we are on track of $300 million to $500 million. And then our expectations for future year is our business model is designed to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations while growing at a double-digit pace and exactly what level that might be in each year will determine as we get better visibility into the year. Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then for follow-up, I've heard rumblings that you're looking at expanding not so much to Express name, but the Express business model to higher price points, basically, everything is included. Do you have any color on that? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're learning a lot with the Express rollout that efficiency and value is a big time driver in sales, and yes, I mean as we create operational efficiencies in Express to translate into the D.R. Horton. We are moving that way. Now, we will always be a locally controlled business. I mean, we're decentralized. Our operators in the field will respond to the market. And if it is a value-based market, they're going to have to drive more efficient homes. If it is a custom-based price point, then we're going to continue to modify our plans and introduce plans at the local level. Paul Przybylski - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I wonder not to get too specific in particular markets, but it's useful to the Express Home where I think you guys have opened up five or six new Express communities. Can you talk about the kind of trends you're seeing in Denver as the existing home sales tighten up there, either due to lack of supply? I mean, you guys seem to be growing whereas others are not seeing that type of acceleration. Could you kind of give us a little market dynamic on how that product and that market is working? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I think we opened up Express in Denver over the past year. The team up there has done a great job getting that online. And it shows that there is a real need for affordable housing in that market, and we're delivering a value product to the market. And it's just being absorbed, and people are very happy with it. We're very happy we can do it and looking forward to try to do more of it. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Ken, it's not consistent with what we've seen in other markets, a lot of pent-up demand when we opened. Absorptions, they've come in higher than we expected. So, it's a powerful tool in what we're accomplishing. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : We're in 51 markets... Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : To the extent... Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Sorry, Ken. We're in 51 markets and 17 states today, so we're continuing to see that expansion as we move throughout the year. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right. And then, I guess, relative to the idea of pace, the idea of pace and price, I'm not a big fan of that notion. But, I mean, are you constraining your pace? Or you're really accepting as many sales as will lock in the door? Can you describe that dynamic broadly speaking? Thank you. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Ken, we've been trying and successfully setting absorption targets on communities based upon what we think is a sustainable demand in a submarket. And we are building and selling to their pace. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on another strong quarter. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: David, I guess on the price point conversation, obviously you guys have done a great job with Express and I think that at least in the investment community, there is this perception that entry-level is accelerating nicely whereas the \u2013 maybe the higher-end luxury segment is seeing some softness. And you guys have been expanding Emerald as well. I don't think it's as much of a topic of conversation. But I was wondering if you can give some updated color on the luxury and how that compares to the obviously, the strength you've been seeing in Express? And how you think about allocating dollars going forward between the segments? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, from a \u2013 The allocation to dollars, we \u2013 it's a market-by-market program. The markets where the upper end is is continuing to stay strong. We will be putting more money on it, but what's really driving the growth right now and the improvement in returns is the lower end, either Express or the lower Horton pricing. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: And would that be true on the margin side as well because obviously, I think you probably go into it thinking that Express is going to generate a lower margin, but it seems like the pricing power has been stronger there. So, what does the spread look like between the Emerald and the Express brands right now? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right now it's in a pretty tight range. Both are very near our company average. Obviously, with the pent-up demand in Express and really not enough supply out there, we've seen better margins than we originally underwrote the deals to. So, right now it's in a pretty tight range. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Great. Thanks a lot. And if I could sneak in one more. Just on the land supply, a pretty big spike in option lots this quarter if I heard that number correctly. And I think you're looking at over 40% to your control lots are option right now. Just curious what you're seeing in the land market that's allowing you to pursue that strategy? Obviously, it ties into your focus on cash generation, but is that a function or there's more AD&C capital available to the developers? Or something else that you've been focusing on to drive that number higher? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I think, we've been focusing heavily on developer relationships and working with them where we can. There's also a little bit of a timing functionality to that. And that \u2013 it can be very high in the middle of the quarter, come down a little bit as you're buying land or lots through the quarter. And at this quarter end, we had a little bit more than we might have been prior quarter ends. But it has been a focus for us. We're pleased with the results we're getting and being able to control more of our future lot supply with options and with developers. And we're going to continue to focus on it. You're right, it is a key part of our cash generation strategy. And we're very excited about the results we've seen. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : But, no, we're not really seeing the A&D environment with the banks improved much. This is really the result of taking the very best of the best developers and trying to improve our relationships with them. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Thanks a lot and good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Curious about the strategy moving forward of growing community counts and then also looking at your growth relative to the market in total. Last year, you grew faster than the market really rolling out Express. But if you look at where demand is and where trends are in the market. Just curious about how you think about investing in growing communities and accelerating growth, how are you feeling about that? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're in 51 markets right now with Express. So, we have, I think, runway there. We are relatively new with the Express brand in another 15, 20 markets that we think we can certainly gain market share in those markets. We're pretty much tracking job growth, and where the economy is supporting housing, that's where we're looking to expand our investment. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: In terms of the pace of the overall growth, are you satisfied with what you're seeing? Is there a desire to invest more to grow faster, or is this kind of what you're targeting and what you would like to sustain? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We planned a solid, consistent double-digit growth both top line, bottom line. We'll continue to create separation from other builders in the industry. And today, we're very happy with that strategy. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : And we believe our current lot position is sufficient to support that double-digit growth pace. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. This quarter, you had a terrific SG&A performance. So, just market improvement, just on trend and over last year. Your gross margins have also been very consistent here, only taking up your pre-tax range by about 20 basis points. So, just wanted to make sure I understood that. Does that mean that there were some temporary factors that may have depressed SG&A? Why would you expect seemingly the terrific performance to reverse, or is it something on the gross margins side for the rest of the year? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Nishu, we didn't see anything unusual this quarter. We did deliver a strong backlog conversion. We delivered a little bit above our guidance range on our closings this quarter, and that helped leverage our SG&A a bit further, but we were very pleased with the leverage we saw on SG&A and we're tracking to a better pace, a better ratio for the year than we had originally guided to. We were guiding to some improvement in SG&A. Now, it's simply showing some better improvement on that. And certainly, as we get further into the year and depending on what our deliveries are later in the year, there is potential we could leverage it a bit better than what we have guided to here. If we were to be at the high end of our volume range, then perhaps we have a chance of beating the low end of our leverage range, our SG&A leverage range. But right now, we're comfortable with the range we've guided to. Nothing unusual, no declining or degradation in our SG&A performance is expected. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And kind of following-up on Alan's question from earlier. You folks as well as many of the other builders have been scaling back the land purchases; Alan discussed obviously the increased use of options. I was just wondering with the step back that many of the builders including yourselves have taken, have you seen pricing these \u2013 the options would argue that that's a little bit easier to get terms like option takedowns, but what are you seeing in terms of the availability and pricing of deals as the stepping back of the public eased, the land price pressures that have been discussed so much in the last couple of years? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Nishu, we're looking to continue our land investment. In fact, we'll be increasing our investment this year over what we did last year, just to replenish lots and then probably a little more to bring it up a little bit. We did see an increase in our option lot position in the controlled pipeline. Some of that will be land we will purchase that's represented as option lots. That's land that's controlled under contracts that we will purchase as land and do the development ourselves. Other contracts within that portfolio would be \u2013 where we will be acquiring finished lots or super pads if you will, in some cases, from third-party developers. But we feel that there are still very good opportunities out there for land acquisition, for well-capitalized builders and for well-capitalized developers to work through. It's hard to quantitatively look and say what's happening with land pricing globally. I would tell you it seems like we're getting anecdotally a second look at a few more deals and things seem to come back around, which is just good for us. We like that. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much, guys. Let me add my congratulations on the strong quarter. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Steve. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just a remark that your SG&A, if you actually do do a little better than your range, that's like, I think if I'm not mistaken that's an all-time record for the company. So that's pretty encouraging. I guess my first question relates to M&A and the opportunity for it. Obviously, there's been, and there still is, a pretty big disparity in valuations between the large and small builders and you all are pretty much leading the pack. I guess my question is, do you see this kind of disparity mirrored in the private market? And particularly where some of the smaller cap publics are trading at book value or below, I mean are you seeing that kind of valuation mirrored in the private marketing expectations? And can you talk about whether or not you think this generally is the right time where you'd be amenable to acquiring assets in that kind of way M&A, given the fact that your strategic focus is on reducing your land investment relative to your revenues right now? Thanks. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We are \u2013 you're correct, Stephen, we do have a strategic focus to improve our ratio of revenue to our land investment today; always looking to do that. That makes us a better steward to the capital that we're entrusted with. We do look at M&A as an opportunity to acquire lots, acquire assets and acquire people and operating platforms and teams. And we do look at several opportunities. They can be very good if buyer and seller expectations are aligned and something can work that's accretive to both. will always be looking at M&A opportunities to grow the business. But there's a lot of expectation gaps sometimes within what some people think what their platform should fetch and what the buyers are willing to actually to transact for. So there's not been as many transactions I think that some people expected to occur. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, this is David. I'll also add, we're going to look at lot. Anybody out there we're going to take a look at and try to see if they fit culturally, strategically within our company. But it's got to be a very good company for it to make sense to us. We like where we are, we like what we're accomplishing. And we really don't want to jump out there and do anything that's going to break that focus. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Yeah. Good luck finding another company as strong as you guys are though. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : They're there. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : They're there. There are some small operators or even midsized operators that are doing a great job. I mean, if you look back at the four acquisitions we've made, we have learned to become better with every one of those. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. That's fair comment. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We take what they're doing good and integrate it into our company. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. I guess my second question relates to the role of master planned communities and some of the opportunities that those larger parcels could potentially provide for you. I was wondering if you could give us some handle on what percent of your business you think is coming from master planned communities today, and where you think that could go to? And as a follow-on to that, would you generally think that in some of these larger parcels, you have the ability to maybe take on a little bit of multifamily construction or even like commercial opportunities longer term? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : The master planned, I'd say, is probably 10%, 15% of our business, and that's just a guess, really. It's not something we've broken down. And, yes, I think as we get bigger, or continue to get bigger, that percentage is going to grow. It's just a lot more efficient to deliver more houses at one location than it is in multiple locations. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : And then, Steve, as you know we always investigate new business lines, if they could complement our business. And so, we have built for rent on land we own on a limited basis when it makes business sense. And we do currently own a few large projects with parcels that are zoned multi-family that we're evaluating or in the process of building apartments on. But we wouldn't expect that to have any financial impact on our 2016 results. Stephen S. Kim - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Fair enough. Thanks very much, guys. Good job. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bob Wetenhall from RBC. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, you guys are crushing a nice job. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Bob. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks, Bob. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's a technical term. Talk to me about ASP appreciation during the balance of the year. How do you think that plays out? What kind of growth rates should we be expecting? And I'm really think about this in the context of not including mix. If you took like-for-like and you blend it together, what do you see going on in the next couple of quarters? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : We would expect to continue to see a few, if you're looking like-for-like, some ability to move price up. We've continued to see our revenues per square foot outpaced our second brick per square foot now once we got back in track a couple of quarters ago. So, very positive on that front and definitely feel the ability to push price. In terms of our overall ASP, we did see on our sales front that really kind of flatten out sequentially, which isn't surprising because of the heavier mix that continues to come from Express. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. But you're still getting the operating leverage off that which offsets the weaker mix. But if you had to stay, like, on a like-for-like basis, would you expect low-single digit or mid-single digit? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Yes, low-single digits. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. That's helpful. And then just kind of thinking about like Texas and California, some of your major markets where you are a leader. Would you say that the trends that you saw this quarter were in line with your expectations a couple of months ago? Or would you say that in your core most important markets that demand is stronger and better than you had anticipated? Just trying to understand a little bit better if you're gauging strength of demand in your most important markets, is it coming out ahead of your expectations? Thanks and good luck. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bob. Kind of a mix like Texas, at least in my mind. Houston is probably underperformed my expectations over the last couple of quarters, but it's been offset by an overperform in Austin, Dallas, and Fort Worth and San Antonio. I mean, the balance of the state is doing incredibly well and... Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Overall we expected a good spring and we're seeing a good spring. Overall, I think it's in-line with our expectations for a good solid, consistent moderately growing market with variations from market to market. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Our absorption to picked up the most in the South East and South Central regions, which is what you've heard us say really kind of Texas across the Florida and up into the Carolina is a big piece to our business that we expect to be very robust. And we've seen a very good level of demand in those markets and a good return on our inventory investments. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Bob, we do have very high expectations at all time. And we are pleased with where the results of the spring have come out and really across the board and all of our markets. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great execution, guys. You're killing it. Good luck next quarter. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and I'll add my congrats on the quarter as well. First question, just on the sales pace, continued expansion there, we have it roughly up 8%, just want to make sure in terms of the drivers there, seems like primarily that's due to the continued expansion of Express as part of your business. I just want to make sure that, that's still is the case in effect and would you expect \u2013 it seems like there's still more room to go. Was that something that you would expect to continue to benefit your results even into fiscal 2017. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I mean, I would say fully rolled out in Texas, Carolinas on the Express model, still got room to grow in all of the other markets. So, I think we got benefit from that brand and that initiative for this year, next year and the year after that, but we're fully integrated, fully rolled out. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just is it fair to say that that's really the, let's say, biggest driver of the improvement in your overall sales pace as reported this quarter? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, it is a major contributor. The other brands are doing well also, but there's just a whole lot less competition at that entry level. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And therefore, more pent-up demand, and it's easier to drive absorption. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Right. Now, certainly. I guess second question just on the improved SG&A guidance that you rolled out this quarter that helps your pre-tax by 20 bps. Now, you've expanded that guidance. Given that you still kind of have similar expectations on the units and it seems like the ASPs, it would suggest that you're not necessarily expecting better \u2013 that the improved leverage has been coming off of improved volumes per se, and it seems like Express and your overall, again top line seems to be coming in as expected. So, are there other things in the SG&A line item that's helping here in terms of kind of concrete items around perhaps advertising or other types of SG&A controllables that are coming in better than expected, or is this just the overall model. In effect, just the overall efficiency just being that much better even with the same type of closings that you expected three months ago? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Mike, it's really just a result of our overall focus on SG&A. It's not any one thing. It's always been a hallmark of our business. It's something we're very focused on. We set a 9.6% SG&A in fiscal 2015 which was the best SG&A we've had other than two years in the company's history when we had a 9% handle as well. And we've now guided to 9.0% to 9.2%. And I'll just say, it is a focus and something that all of our guys in the field are looking at. It's how can we run the business more efficiently and leverage our overhead better than we have in the past. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Michael, this is David. We get up every day and try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier to build a house, a little bit easier to sell a house, and a little bit easier to get the house closed. And we work on that every single day, because that is a sustainable, competitive advantage. And that is \u2013 that's what we try to be. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No. That's great. And obviously it's great to see as the recovery continues. One last quick question if I could. Community count now flattish for about four quarters. Is that something that you would expect to reaccelerate at some point maybe into the mid-single digit or high-single digit growth into next year? Or should we just continue to expect sales pace over the next couple of years to drive the bus? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mike, for this year, we stated we expect our community count to be in kind of that low-single digit or relatively flat this year with the improvement in sales coming from improved absorptions. And certainly, the Express rollout is a driver of that. I think it will continue to be a driver next year. As Express matures, if you're looking over the next year or two, you would naturally expect to grow at the double-digit pace. You would see a stronger community count growth over the longer term. We don't really have the visibility fully for 2017 yet to make any specific comments on that, though. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Right now, Michael, we're replacing communities every quarter every month. And when you create a community that's driving an absorption level of two or three or a new community that's on an Express model that's driving six or eight. Flat community count. There's a lot of efficiencies and absorption improvement. So, yes, but over time, we will be expanding our community count that lead to market. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Very helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Good morning, Jack. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Good morning. Hey, first question for Bill, you're generating a ton of cash. It sounds like that trend is going to continue in the next year and years beyond. Your leverage levels are getting to the lower end of, I think, probably optimal. Your land strategy has changed a bit. And it sounds like you're going to kind of keep it about the same point even though the mix is going to change from an absolute level. I guess the question is, what do you do with the cash? I know in the past, there have been share repurchase. There's been debt repurchase. What do we think about longer-term goals with the cash beyond sort of second half spend, that sort of thing around capital management? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly, this year, Jack, we're generating $300 million to $500 million, and we're to paying off over $500 million of debt this year. So, for fiscal 2016, essentially, debt retirement and continuing to invest in the business. We do continue to look at M&A opportunities, we've done several deals over the last several years, and to the extent that we see good deals that are a good fit for us as we described earlier. That will be a priority as well. And then beyond that, we want to stay opportunistic. And so, we're not going to tie ourselves down to anything specific beyond this year, but right now, we're focused on debt retirement, being opportunistic investing in the business, and then we'll assess further as we get visibility into 2017. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then my follow-up question, through our travels, I think one of the things that we've seen is the Express-type product is appealing to a buyer group maybe beyond the entry or first-time buyer. Really, we're surprised that the trade down empty-nester, everybody think of the active adult is maybe at mid to upper-end product, but we're seeing a lot in the lower price points as well. Are you seeing that a meaningful way? Has it changed the trajectory or the direction of the rollout of the Express product, or maybe even location? What can you share with us about that dynamic? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I wouldn't say that it's changed the direction. We have seen that take place especially on Florida, it surprised me as well, or when we launched Express in Florida, 40%, 45% were actually the people buying their last home, not their first home. And that's something we're taking note of, and making sure that we're in a position to accommodate those buyers. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : My first question is just going back to your third quarter guidance in terms of the conversion rate, I believe you said 76% to 80%. That just feels a little light relative to where we were modeling our expectations. Would you say that you saw any pull-forward in demand in the second quarter, perhaps maybe due to the overall better weather that most of the country saw? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : You know, Sue, not necessarily that we're attributing it to better weather. But our operators did convert their backlog at a higher rate than we anticipated and then what we've told you for Q2. When we look at our business plan for Q3, which we're expecting to deliver on, it's right in the heart of that 76% to 80% range that we've guided to for Q3. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. The timing of the deliveries through the year is a function of really the roll up of all of our communities and the timing of when communities come online and when housing starts gets started. And right now, the way it's rolling up division-by-division points to that range, but still for the year points to the same range we gave at the start of the year. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : And historically, we typically do see a tick down in our conversion rate from Q2 to Q3. That's a normal seasonal trend for us. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then looking at your spec levels, it seems like those are continuing to sort of trend down over time. Can you just talk a little bit about what's contributing to that and what should we make of that? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : I think we can contribute that there's a very strong demand in the marketplace right now. And that we are starting specs and getting them out there and getting them sold early in the construction process. And its \u2013 you've got to start more houses. And then, so you get those started and you get those sold. In addition, we're starting some houses to-be-built jobs as well. So our overall mix of build versus spec is staying the same, we're just seeing very strong demand in the marketplace. More efficient with turning of our homes is one of the key drivers of our cash flow generation. Doing more revenue, more closings with the same number of homes under construction at any point in time, a key part of our focus. Susan M. Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just going back to Susan's question. When you look at your current percentage of closings that are spec, could you talk about that? And how you feel going into, kind of, the peak construction period in regards to potential labor inflation and or delays? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : And so, in terms of our specs that we closed in the quarter, it was in our normal range, which is every quarter, 70% to 80% of what we're closing is a spec. And so, when you look at our reported gross margin, you're essentially seeing our spec gross margin. In terms of labor...? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We're not seeing a tremendous amount of labor inflation. In fact, we've been able to stay ahead of the cost increases we've seen on stick and brick, which any cost increase that have come through have been more labor oriented versus the materials and the commodities today. But we haven't seen a tremendous amount of pressure. And in terms of shortages affecting delays, our cycle times have remained very consistent, and we've not had, as evidenced by our backlog conversion rate last quarter, we have not had a real labor constraint widespread that's affected closings. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Again, as you drive higher absorption in a community-by-community basis, you take a lot of pressure off the trade base, because a lot of their time is just going from community to community. And if we can get them into the community and keep them there, they can make more money, a lot less pressure on pricing. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just as a follow-up, you mentioned your stick and brick costs are fairly stable. Is there any way you can parse down on the categories in terms of the movements, for example, lumber and how you think about that going through the year? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : In terms of overall, our revenue per square foot year-over-year was up about 4% and our stick and brick was up about 2.5%. Sequentially, it was closer to both being up about 1%. The majority of the cost inflation, as Mike mentioned, we continue to see is on the labor side not the material side. And so lumber specifically, I wouldn't say we've seen anything unusual in lumber prices. They tend to follow a seasonal trend, and we haven't seen anything unusual this year. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you, and congrats again. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Thank you for taking the call, guys. First question, last quarter, I believe you mentioned not heavily reinvesting in Houston at this point, but kind of taking more of a replenishing strategy. Was that the case in the second quarter? And did anything happen in the quarter where you might have \u2013 might change that strategy going forward? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : No, that would still be the case in the second quarter. It may change in the future as we are positioned to take advantage of opportunistic buys. And as stress gets put on a market, sometimes that creates an opportunity for us. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the cash flow guide, $300 million to $500 million, it's a fairly wide range. Can you just remind us what kind of drive the upper end of the range versus the lower end? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It really comes down to our overall revenue volume, our closings volume. It would be \u2013 is the main driver. We expect that predominance of that cash flow to come in our fourth quarter when we have our largest closings quarter. And essentially then, the wide range is attributable to a little bit unpredictability on the timing of when land purchases will close. And so, as we get a little closer to the end of the year, we might be able to tighten that a bit. But, there is some unpredictability in the timing of when the land deals will close. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Great. If I could sneak one housekeeping in here. The flat community count that you guys talked about, was that year-over-year or is that sequentially? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Yeah. We mentioned that our year-over-year community count was essentially flat, and it was actually down slightly. And really when we look at that going forward, we would expect no more than a low single-digit movement. Either way, it could be up or down in a low single-digit percentage here over the next couple of quarters. John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and nice quarter. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Wanted to go back to some of the comments and obviously, a lot of questions and remarks about the Express side, but just from a \u2013 made a comment about just seeing a lot less competition there. And clearly, you've had a period of \u2013 number of quarters of success, competitors have taken notice. Feels like the market in general there's a more positive tone on the entry-level and some acknowledgement that it seems like that demand is pushing outward. And so, I'm just curious to hear your take on \u2013 we've kind of heard that some other builders are starting to explore similar things, maybe not quite the same. But as you're looking at new land deals, are you running up against more competition than you would have seen kind of 6, 9, 12 months ago? And how do you think they're positioned? Or what's the \u2013 what do you think that they're doing differently? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We tend to focus a lot on what we're doing, and we do see some competition on the land front. It's constant out there, and it's market-by-market and it varies. What other things they do with their entry level, entrants, I've heard of others coming to market. There's some of it out there, but broadly we're not seeing widespread, heavy competition today with us flag-by-flag. Certainly, in our pockets but there's more competition. But generally, we're not seeing it. How others tend to approach that market? That will be up to them. We're focused on providing a great value for the home buyer, and so our customer can be in their house. They can be in there at a good price they can afford and a place for their family. But as entry level grows, we do expect more competition to come. And we're certainly prepared to deal with that is as it comes. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask regarding leverage. At this point in the cycle, is your plan to retire near-term debt maturities as was indicated in the press release to reduce leverage? Or do you plan to eventually replace those maturities with similar-sized debt offerings? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We always look at the debt markets, and we'll remain opportunistic there. There are certainly \u2013 it's a favorable market right now. But where we sit today with our cash position with our expectations for cash flows, we right now do not expect to be in the debt market in the short term. We have already paid off the $373 million that came due on April 15. We paid that out of cash. And we believe our cash position, our liquidity available on the revolver and our cash flows are sufficient for the remainder of the year as we sit here today. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: And just regarding other income, can you comment on what drove the spike in the second quarter? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We did have \u2013 we sold an investment that we had in debt securities. It's been \u2013 You can look back in our 10-Qs, there's been a disclosure around that investment. We had some debt securities that we had acquired a while back that gave us access to some lands that we have now acquired the land and are actively developing it. And we were able to restructure those debt securities and resell them in the market. So, we had a gain on that sale of $4.5 million, which was an improvement in our other income line this quarter. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And just lastly, the capital markets uncertainty and spread widening that we've seen this year, you may have alluded to it on the land side, the second look you referred to, but have you noticed any impact on either the land market or sales trends due to the volatility? Thanks a lot. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : It's hard to attribute it to any one factor. Just the competitive environment, deal-by-deal is different. We are seeing a few more second looks, so that's been very positive for us. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jade. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Good morning, everyone. First question, I know Houston is a smaller market for you, guys, but if you could update us on what's happening on the ground there? And what you think you're going to see in terms of delays for either labor or materials to get homes finished. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Jay, it's business as usual. We're \u2013 we feel for the people and what they're going through in Houston right now with the horrendous flooding. But our operations are fine, and we don't expect any noticeable impact on our business in Houston. Clearly, the market has just softened due to the lower oil prices, but we continue to see very consistent, steady demand at price points below $300,000. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We like the Houston market, big believers in that long term. And if it becomes \u2013 if we see an opportunity to buy something at a very advantageous price, we're going to be all over it. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Got it. The second question I had, there was a small order decline in the East geography this quarter. Could you talk about what's going on in that market? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The East for us is the Carolinas and North, so it's really more Northeast for us. And, yeah, we were down, I believe, 2% in sales units. Our community count in that region was actually down. So, our absorptions were actually up mid-single digits there. So really just reflects probably fewer investments over the last few years, manifesting itself with your communities. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We're kind of going through a reset up in the Northeast. We like where we're headed. But it's not going to be a stellar performance this year. Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in July to share our third quarter. But I'd also like to once again thank the entire D.R. Horton team. You are truly the best in the industry and your quarter-to-quarter consistent performance proves that out. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

(Broker) Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different.

Additional information about issues that can lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q next week. After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes current and historical supporting data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased to $379 million on $3.2 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax profit margin improved 40 basis points to 11.7%. Our homes sold increased 13% compared to the third quarter of 2015 as we continued to see improvement in absorption per community. These results reflect the consistent solid performance of our core D.R. Horton communities and our Emerald Homes and Express Homes brands as we strive to be the leading builder in each of our markets. Our focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenues and profits, while generating positive cash flows and increasing returns. During the nine months ended June, we generated $89 million of cash from operations, on track for our second consecutive year of positive cash flows. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 14.3%, up from 12.1% a year ago. With a sales backlog of 14,670 homes at the end of June and a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes, we are well positioned for the fourth quarter and next year. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Net income for the third quarter increased 13% to $250 million or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to $221 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 13% to $379 million in the third quarter versus $334 million a year ago. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 16% to $349 million compared to $302 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 9% to $3.1 billion on 10,739 homes closed, up from $2.9 billion on 9,856 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $290,400, essentially flat both sequentially and compared to last year. This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 28% of homes closed and 20% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 14% from the prior year quarter to $3.4 billion, and homes sold increased 13% to 11,714 homes on a slight decrease on our average active selling communities. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $293,300. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 21%, consistent with the prior year quarter. The value of our backlog increased 17% from a year ago to $4.4 billion, with an average sales price per home of $298,600 and homes in backlog increased 15% to 14,670 homes. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 78%, at the midpoint of the range we guided to on our second quarter call. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.3%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter. The improvement in our margin this quarter was primarily due to controlling cost increases while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. Our general gross margin expectations remain unchanged. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sale gross margin to be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, and the relative impact of warranty and interest costs. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense was $280 million, compared to $258 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of homebuilding revenue, SG&A improved 10 basis points to 8.9%, compared to 9% in the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended June, our SG&A improved 40 basis points to 9.5% compared to 9.9% in the same period in the prior year. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our current and expected growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $29.4 million, compared to $31.7 million in the prior year quarter. 92% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 49% in the prior year quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO Score of 716 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, compared to 41% in the third quarter last year. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : At the end of June, we had 25,300 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models. 11,300 of our total homes were spec homes with 8,200 in various stages of construction and 3,100 completed. Our construction in progress in finished homes inventory increased by $218 million during the quarter due to seasonal construction activity. Our third quarter investments in lots, land and development totaled $823 million, of which $586 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $237 million was for land development. For the nine months ended June, our investments totaled $2 billion, an increase of 18% from the same period last year. We expect a continued increase in our investments in land and development in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : June 30, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 202,000 total lots, of which 112,000 or 55% are owned and 90,000 or 45% are controlled through option contracts. 73,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 30,000 are owned and 43,000 are optioned. Our 202,000 total lots owned and controlled provide us a strong competitive advantage with a sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in sales and closings in future periods. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : During the third quarter, we recorded $2.9 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $5.2 million of inventory impairment charges primarily due to an expected land sale in the East region. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment which may result in future charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate. Our inactive land held for development of $156 million at the end of the quarter represents 9,100 lots, down 29% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. Mike? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : At June 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $863 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $882 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 730 basis points from a year ago to 30%. During the quarter, we repaid $373 million of senior notes at their maturity and the balance of our public notes outstanding at June 30 was $2.8 billion. We have $350 million of debt maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our shareholders' equity was $6.5 billion and book value per share was $17.50, up 14% from a year ago. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our homes closed to approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 81% to 84% at an average sales price around $290,000. We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be around 20% and we expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.4% to 8.7% of homebuilding revenues. We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margin will be around 35%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be around 35% and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be approximately 377 million shares. And we continue to expect $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows from operations for the full year of fiscal 2016. Our expectations are based on today's housing market conditions. Our current preliminary expectations for fiscal 2017 are for our consolidated revenues to grow by approximately 10% to 15% and for our consolidated pre-tax margin to increase to a range of 11.2% to 11.5% for the full year. We also expect to generate positive cash flows from operations for the third consecutive year in a range of approximately $300 million to $500 million. We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2017 will be between 35% and 36% and that our diluted share count next year will increase by approximately 1.5%. David? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : In closing, our third quarter growth in sales, closings and profits and the improvement in our pre-tax profit margin are the result of the strength of our people and our operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and continue to expand our industry-leading market share. D.R. Horton has been the largest builder in the United States for 14 consecutive years. And according to Builder Magazine's recent Local Leaders issue, in 2015, we were the number one builder in 13 of the top 50 U.S. housing markets and a top five builder in 30 of the largest markets. Since 2009, our market share has increased from 5% to 8%. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and profit at a double-digit annual pace while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald and Express brands, attractive finished lot and land position and, most importantly, our tremendous team across the country. We'd like to thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we are excited and looking forward to our opportunities ahead. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today is coming from the line of Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : Thank you, and good morning, everybody. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : Good morning. David, maybe I'll ask you a little bit. Thanks for the guidance on all that. That's very helpful. And if I look at the cash flow for 2017, another year that looks a lot like this year, I guess, a couple of things. What does that imply? Again, going back to your capital allocation that I always ask you, but what does that imply for being able to grow your communities and what growth rate are you expecting? Is it in that 10% to 15% range that you have for revenues? And then, as you look out, what's your next use there? Is it \u2013 are you seeing M&A out there? Do you have more debt pay down, et cetera? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, I think, right now, we're looking at every opportunity that's out there. As we've talked before, our goal is to be consistent and kind of take advantage of situations as they appear in our market. Community count growth, I would think we're probably going to take community count up single digit, mid-single digit maybe. Certainly, paying down debt to me is always a good thing, deleveraging the balance sheet and creating opportunities as they arise is something that we believe in. And as far as our guidance for next year, I think it's just \u2013 we see a consistent solid market out there. And we're well positioned to take advantage of it and just going to continue to try to improve our execution and get better at building, selling, closing houses every day. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : Okay. And just going back to the M&A, what are you seeing out there from the privates? And then, switching gears, it sounds like so, for next year, you've got your absorption rate continuing to improve. Is that really just being driven on the Express side of the world or are you seeing anything else in the markets? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well from the \u2013 the absorption rate, yes, the Express definitely drives higher absorption rates than even the core Horton brand and has \u2013 we continue to expand that brand. We're in 51 markets I think right now. We're going to continue to push that brand into other markets. And I think we will see added absorption developed on a division standpoint, improved the absorption division-by-division which drives the overall. But I do think that we will see growth in communities next year. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Stephen, this is Mike. On your M&A question, we continue to see various private builders across the country testing the waters. We've been very fortunate with the acquisitions we've made. We've been very selective, brought on a lot of good people, lot of good teams. And we'll continue to be selective. We've set a high bar internally and we're looking for the best opportunities that either expand our geographic coverage or bring us new customers, new customer segments. Stephen F. East - Wells Fargo : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Hi. Good morning and congrats on another strong quarter. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Alan. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: David, and I think I might have asked you this last quarter, too, but the option lot count, I mean, 90,000 now, you're almost 70% from a year ago, 45% of your total lots controlled option. What are you seeing in the land market that you've been able to drive that success? Because, obviously, that's going to be a huge positive for returns and it seems like you're not really anticipating those options having much of an impact on your margin because you're still keeping the same language for roughly 20% gross margin. So, is it just that the land market is opening up and developers have access to capital and they're more willing to flip through these lots on options or are you kind of going outside the box and doing something unusual, because none of your competitors seem to have had as much success as you have? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've got a huge advantage in it. We've got a great big footprint, and our absorption per community is something that developers that are putting lots on the ground look to. So, good market, then we're going to build houses. And I think our outreach to the development community, we are a much friendlier buyer. I think it's becoming \u2013 our goal is to really partner with these guys and to put their capital at play and avoid some of the longer-term negatives of owning as a builder, as a public company. So, it's just focus, to be honest with you; focus and execution. Our guys out there have been asked to do it, and they're getting it done. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: And generally, you're able to underwrite these deals and keep a pretty similar gross margin as if you were to own that land outright or is there a margin differential when you do this? And just the final follow-up there is, is it widespread across the country where you're having a success or are there certain geographies where the majority of those option lots are located? Thank you. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : As far as across the country, we've got option. We've been able to create option lot situations in California. And I could tell you in the last market, there was never a chance of doing that. So it really is just focus. And as far as margin, yes, the margins may be a little bit lower but the returns are significantly higher. And that's, to me, we value capital. We want maximize the return we get on capital. And so, creating a nominal amount of margin for a significantly higher return is a good way of helping our shareholders, maximizing the value of the shares. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Thank you. Good luck. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. Interested in Express from a competitive standpoint and also from a customer standpoint what you're observing evolving, as this product has continued to move forward. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Eric, this is Bill. Certainly, from a competitive standpoint, we've been very pleased with what we've seen with Express. We're offering a great value, an affordable value for buyers out there, and there's still very limited inventory and very limited supply of affordable product out there in the market. So we're still seeing what we've been seeing as we've rolled it from market to market. We've been introducing Express into some of our western markets over the last couple of quarters and we're seeing very positive responses there as well. We've commented in prior quarters about in markets like Florida where there are perhaps more retirees, we have seen more of \u2013 a larger mix of older buyers buying the Express Homes because they see the same value there. And so that's been a nice observation as well that I think will serve us well going forward. That's just another element of demand for that product line. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: In terms of the runway with this product, both from a competitive standpoint and your ability to source land where the economics work for this product, and then as well as a percentage of your total business, where are we and what's the runway from here look like moving forward? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : We expect to continue to expand that footprint, as David mentioned earlier. Today, we're in 51 markets and 17 states. It was 28% of our sales, it was also 28% of our closings and 20% of our revenues. If you recall when we first introduced this and got the question about when this is rolled out, what does that look like. We've generally talked about, over time, about 60% of our revenues coming from our core D.R. Horton brands, 20% from Emerald, 20% from Express, which would infer probably closer to 30% in units on the Express side. I think at this point, we would tell you that it looks like we will overshoot that during this cycle, because that's where the demand is right now, and we want to cater to that demand and what we believe it's still being underserved. So, we don't have any set targets on where it could go. We'll continue to adjust our business based on what we see in the market to go capture as much market share as we can. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We're allocating capital based upon the highest returning projects. And right now, we have been pleasantly surprised with the demand for Express and have actually seen higher margins than we originally underwrote, and higher absorption levels than we originally underwrote. So, it is a great way to improve returns for the shareholders. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Hello, gentlemen, Jessica. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks, Ken. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So, David, if you \u2013 I mean, we talked a long time ago about the housing market prices. Your Express Homes, obviously, it's differentiated. It's only 20% of revenue but it's obviously contributing to your volume. So, if you do that 28% of closings, 20% of revenue, you're at a house at about $210,000 in terms of price point. So, what does it mean? I mean thanks for giving the FY 2017 guidance, many other builders wouldn't do that. What gives you the confidence? I know you have your visibility into 1Q based on your units under construction. But what really gives you the confidence to be making these statements about the back half of 2017, A? And then, B, because it seems as though, as you get this growth, could we be seeing flat to down pricing on your average sales, realizing turns are offsetting that? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : On the pricing front, right now, we're anticipating it to stay essentially flat. But, yes, it could trend down with Express continuing to become a bigger mix. What we are seeing, though, is the markets we're rolling Express out in today are the higher priced markets, so it's not as much of an incremental drag on our ASP as the initial rollout was. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Right now, Ken, California is probably going to be, we think, a very successful Express market for us. We are early in the process rolling out there. It's \u2013 typical Express, only California's going to be over our average sales price right now. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Ken, when we look at fiscal 2017 and our visibility and our confidence level, it's simply a reflection, number one, that we do see a good market. Right now, it's a good stable healthy market, some variability market to market certainly, but it's a relatively stable market. But what we see the most is our positioning. Across our divisions, our division operators are doing a tremendous job of positioning communities, positioning lots in front of those communities and really executing well on our product offerings today. And so as we begin to look forward the next several quarters, the next 18 months or so, we really do have good visibility and confidence level to be able to deliver consistently at a double-digit pace on the revenue line, continue to drive some additional SG&A leverage to improve our operating margin, and improve our returns. And so we felt like it was appropriate to start to give some preliminary guidance to next year as we did last year at this time for fiscal 2016. And certainly, we've been pleased that we've essentially delivered on that preliminary guidance thus far this year. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Right, no, I think it's obviously nice to have that early communication. If I could go back to the gross margin still on these \u2013 on your guidance, A builder reported today modestly trimmed their guidance, another public builder talked about gross margin pressure. So it seems as though the either construction cost or land inflation, given your roughly 20% gross margin, you feel that's defensible. Is that because you're getting better pricing on perhaps on these Express than you are on the other pieces, or is it just that you bought the land at a lower targeted gross margin? I mean, what's \u2013 you can't comment on other builders but it seems as though you're not concerned about gross margin degradation next year. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We are always very focused on gross margin, Ken. But what we've seen is that we have taken some lot costs as a percentage of revenue, taken some of those increases and they would offset them with reduced incentives and controlling some cost increases on a stick and brick side. When we get our community to the targeted absorption levels, at those points, we're able to bring incentives down or take pricing up and protect the margin. And overall on the balance, the team has done a great job of enhancing the margin on a consolidated basis this quarter. And we feel good about with the range of the guidance we're giving on the margin that that's a defensible position for us going forward, as we continue to drive absorptions community-by-community. Part of that's been Express and simplifying some of our operations behind the scene and that and delivering a house with fewer labor hours in it to get it built, and part of it's been some of the great land positioning we've been doing over the past few years. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Ken, we feel very good about next year. I mean what we're seeing in the markets, there's not a lot of lots being put on the ground that we're going to have to compete against. There is still pent-up demand at entry level and first move-up price points. It just feels good right now. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : You guys are crushing it and I love the fact that you have that crystal ball somewhere in the office in Fort Worth into 2017. Wanted to ask you, when we're thinking about comments around 2017, it's kind of like flat ASP performance looking out. How should we be thinking about the interplay between kind of like community absorption rates versus new community growth? Because I think to get to your kind of range of 10% to 15% against flat pricing, you can either deliver faster or you can open new communities. What's the right way to think about that? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Bob, we think in 2017 it will be a combination of driving further improvement in our absorption coupled with, at some point as we move throughout 2017, an increase in our community count. Our community count on a year-over-year basis was down, which was not a surprise to us, and we would expect over the next couple of quarters, it to move up or down no more than a low to mid single-digit range. But at some point, as we move throughout the year, we would expect an increase in that community count to help drive that 10% to 15% consolidated top line growth. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Bob, we don't have a crystal ball, but Don Horton does tell us what it's going to be and we go do it. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's quite helpful. And you guys are speaking a lot about California, and I was hoping you could kind of \u2013 you know, I always think that's a cash market, not a option market. And I was hoping \u2013 it sounds like the torch is kind of being passed from really good growth in the Southeast to a very optimistic view of West Coast markets. Could you just give us some flavor of what you're seeing in terms of land buying opportunity and your expectations for growth in both Northern California, Southern California and the Phoenix market? Thanks a lot. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Bob, the growth we're looking at there is at a new price point that hasn't existed out there. And we feel very optimistic based upon the land that we've been able to put in front of that program. So do we feel more optimistic about California than the balance of the country? Absolutely not. I think Texas continues to be strong and our Southeast area just continues to outperform. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And we're introducing Express in Phoenix and certainly expect it to do very well there and expect to see some growth out of Phoenix as well. But really, the key is the affordable product that we're offering. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : It just runs at a much higher absorption. And developers typically when they see that, they feel more comfortable putting less on the ground force. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just to understand, are you saying the price point for what you're bringing to the California markets, just going to be way below competing entry level and first-time homebuyer product in the market? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not saying way below. I'm saying that the value combination is going to be superior. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : (32:19) David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And we've been able to capture market share with that product offering. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : It makes sense. Good luck. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. And yeah, just following up on the double-digit and I appreciate the guidance there and, obviously, the confidence that that shows. So, so far in the Q&A, you've touched on, obviously, some low single-digit rate of community count growth. ASPs, selling prices continuing this kind of flattish trend that they've had this year, putting the burden, if you will, on absorption. Then Jessica, you just mentioned that in the prior question. How should we think about that? Is that absorptions across the portfolio? So on a same-store D.R. Horton brand basis, we would see strong absorption growth there? Or is this \u2013 with \u2013 there's obviously a lot of community rotation, is this Express subbing in for other brands as its percentage grows, and naturally those are at higher absorptions. So that would drive the absorption again. How should we think about it and how you're thinking about it for next year? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Nishu, there's several pieces of it. And I think you touched on a lot of them, some of the Express communities rotating in. Also just within the core D.R. Horton communities, some of the communities that we're closing out may have been smaller communities and what's been opening are communities with larger lot positions in front of them that are going to be running at higher absorption paces that are coming on line, have been coming on line over the past few quarters and will be coming on line into the future. So, that's where we're seeing our double-digit growth within the existing community count. And we do expect, as David mentioned, that we'd probably be growing average selling community count slightly into 2017. But the nature of the communities, each one producing a few more sales than the ones that they're replacing. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. That's really helpful. And then also, consolidated pre-tax, I believe that you've kind of got it to high 10%s, 10.7% to 11.2%, I think you'd said last quarter, and I think has specifically led up this quarter. But when thinking about 2017 and, Jessica, I think you'd mentioned below 11%s for next year. A lot of that, I imagine, is coming from continued SG&A leverage. I was wondering if you could just provide some general color around that. Or also, the financial services profitability is part of the mix there as well, that's been pretty strong, consistent. So, was just wondering if you could give us your thoughts on trends on both of those. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : You're correct, Nishu, that we do expect the majority of our operating margin improvement next year to come from SG&A leverage again like it did this year. And so, we've guided specifically to 11.2% to 11.5% and we would expect our gross margins to be right around 20%, and to drive that better bottom line by further stretching our overhead structure -leveraging our overhead structure. SG&A \u2013 or in terms of the financial services business, they did see a step down in our margin this year, which we've been expecting. They've had outsized gross margins for the last year or two. They're still operating at a very good level. We guided to Q4 for that to be around 35%. They follow the homebuilder business seasonally, so in fiscal 2017, we would expect them to have lower operating margins in the first six months of the year and then to pick up in the back half of the year like we saw in 2016. We'd expect a similar trend in 2017. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question I had was on the East region, I believe you highlighted the impairment in the quarter was largely driven by a partial sale or expected land sale there. And I was curious if that was the same parcel that you took the impairment on in the second quarter. And just more broadly regarding the East, I think when we marketed a couple, did our own D.R. a couple of months ago. Kind of talked to the East as an area of opportunity maybe doing a little bit better, gaining some share there. An area that maybe a relative to some of your other regions, there's still some share to be gained there. So, any just thoughts specifically on the impairment and secondly, on the opportunity you see in the region over the next year or two? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Michael, this is Mike. That is not the same project that we impaired. We sold that project that we impaired in the second quarter. That's no longer with us. This project is a different project. It had been an older project in land held for development. We evaluated it, determined the best course of action for us was to pull the capital out of it and move forward, redeploy that capital. And we do see opportunity for growth and improving our position in our East market. But that's not going to happen overnight. We're working hard on it every day. We've had some changes in the teams up there and very excited about the direction they're taking us and the opportunities they're putting in front of us. But as with everything, nothing ever happens fast enough or quick enough for us, but we're working very hard to get more lots on the ground in front of us and get those communities open and drive more growth out of those. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Our public East region, Mike, just for clarification, includes our Northeast markets, which are the ones Mike was referring to, our Capital division and our New Jersey division. But the East publicly reported region also does include the Carolinas, which those are firing on all cylinders and very strong markets for us today. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. I appreciate that clarification. I guess a second question on the gross margin. Obviously, you're very clear in your guidance, but you did have a nice \u2013 a little better than expected result this quarter, and you highlighted a couple of the drivers. I was wondering if there was some particular elements of mix that also helped this quarter. And I guess looking forward, do you still expect the gross margin to be in and around 20%? I was curious on that. You talked about Express coming in a little better than expected and, obviously, as you do more Express and more Emerald, I'd expect the efficiencies and experience to maybe result in a little bit better amount of profitability. So, again, sorry for the two-parter, for my second question again, but mix on the quarter and then some of those improved operational efficiencies or experience benefiting the margin into next year. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Mike. This is Bill. Nothing unusual on the margin this quarter other than just continued focus on execution and controlling our costs. We've been absorbing labor cost increases, some materials cost increases over time, and we've been working to offset those and we're making some progress there. We're getting some traction on that, while we're still absorbing increasing land costs that are coming in. So we've done, I think, an improving job on controlling those costs and continuing to push price and then reduce incentives wherever we can. So, we did see a nice little pickup this quarter, nothing unusual in that number, and it's really just in that normal range of around 20%, we would expect to see. A move of 30 basis points or 40 basis points is not really unusual in and around 20%. But certainly pleased to post a quarter at a little bit above 20% and hopefully, we can \u2013 we're always focused on doing everything we can to maintain and improve on that while driving better returns. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just thoughts around some of the better efficiencies as you gain experience in Express and Emerald, could that be ultimately showing up as a potential positive lift or is it just another element that allows you to combat, let's say, rising land costs and labor costs? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly, part of our strategy is to get better every day at what we do. The margins that we see across the three brands are actually pretty closely clustered together around the company average. And we do expect to get better in every community every day at what we do, and we have seen that. We have seen our margins moving up. And we're held to a pretty high standard to expect to continue to see those margins, making progress on them every day. Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And in a market, Mike, that does continue to improve and grow, there will be cost increases that come along the way, and these additional efficiencies that we are able to glean out of the business do help offset those other cost increases. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I wanted to understand the message on backlog conversion a little bit better. So 81% to 84% for the fourth quarter. You did the midpoint of the range this quarter. If I go 84%, I get to the midpoint of the range, which I guess should mean if you had a sort of similar result this quarter than last, you'd be in the sort of \u2013 albeit, admittedly, it's a narrow range for the year on deliveries, but you'd be at the bottom half. Is that the message, or is it conservatism on the guidance range? How do we think about that? And then on a broader base, is an 8 handle on the backlog conversion, I mean is that the new Horton norm, given the product mix is at \u2013 that number's sort of stepped up the last couple years? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Jack, there's a lot of fluctuation in our backlog conversion rate, and there's a lot of things that impact that each quarter. But if you look at the last four years to five years on average, our Q3 to Q4 change in our backlog conversion has typically been about flat. So, we are saying that it's going to go up a little bit to that 81% to 84% compared to what we did this quarter. I would not tell you there is a bunch of conservatism baked into that. As you saw this quarter, we delivered at the midpoint of our range and in some of the headlines out there it's being called a miss, even though we are right in the dead center of the guidance we've provided. So, no conservatism on next quarter. We feel good about delivering 81% to 84%. And it's a little bit better and we're focused every day on delivering the best we can. And we would like to continue to see a backlog conversion right in the 80% range, but there'll be some quarters that are in the 70%s. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : From an operational efficiency and getting better, that's something we look at and strive to improve because that helps with the SG&A leverage, it helps with the inventory turn. Conversion rate is a great metric to determine whether you're actually getting better or not. So, we're not going to guide. Optimistically, it's a consistent market, we've got a consistent solid performance and expect to continue that. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. And then, your FHA mix from the mortgage company was up a bit year-over-year. The rhetoric from some of the larger banks seems to suggest that they're moving away from that product somewhat with some of the inherent sort of legacy legal risks or tail risk to that program. Are you seeing any shift from FHA to private mortgage insurance in your borrower base more granularly, or is it still pretty stable? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : I'd say it's pretty stable. The difference for us is with Express becoming a bigger piece of our mix, their percentage usage for those buyers of FHA loans is higher than our company average. It's closer to the mid-40%s. So, that's really the function there. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thanks. So our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : You've mentioned the fact that you are seeing some more older buyers coming in to your Express communities, and as we think about the evolution of Express and maybe some of the demographic trends that we expect to come through, is that something that we could see sort of further come along and perhaps maybe even evolve from a marketing or branding perspective down the line? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. We are certainly focused on all the buyers that are responding to Express. And we're seeing great acceptance of Express in Florida, as Jessica mentioned before, with some of the retiree buyers and we're going to look to meet those buyers' needs and understand exactly what it is they want, and put a house on the ground for them at a great value. People that are retiring on a fixed income are looking for value in a high quality, well-built home. That's exactly in the wheelhouse of what we do. And so I think you can expect to see that we're going to try to take advantage of every opportunity in front of us including that buyer demographic. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then as we think about some of the labor issues that remain out there and the experience that builders in general are facing, do we expect any change outside of the normal seasonality in terms of your spec pace or your start pace as we go through in the next few quarters? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We're looking at our starts pace to just kind of continue as we go seasonally to build some inventory for the spring and to be prepared for the spring selling season next year. Hopefully, it's good or better as the one we just came out of. And we're seeing \u2013 certainly, labor is always a challenging component. Our market positioning, the scale we have in so many of our markets gives us a great advantage on the labor availability front. And we watch very closely our build times and our cycle times, and we're not seeing an elongation of that. So we feel like our team is doing a great job of managing their trade base. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : The absorption per community is a great deal to expand our option lot program, but it is also a great deal to secure and keep the labor force because they come in, they start, and we build through the communities instead of start, stop, start, stop, and they're always out chasing new job sites so there's a lot of benefits to what we're doing. That's one of them. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. First question is on Southeast conversions that have been a little bit light year-over-year in the first three quarters. Was there anything in 2015 that made those exceptionally \u2013 the conversion exceptionally strong or is there something going on this year? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I wouldn't say there's anything unusual, John. They did certainly see very strong absorptions last year. That's moderated a little bit this year, but we're still seeing very strong growth and expect very strong growth going forward in the Southeast. They're delivering right in line with our expectations. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Moving on. Valuations across the group have risen in the past couple of weeks in particular. In your conversations with the private builders, are you hearing a general expectation for higher prices on the private side as well on the M&A front? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : We always probably have a bit of a valuation gap at the initial conversations. It takes time and that's why our bar's pretty high and we're very selective in what we're doing, and we're going to look to make the right acquisitions where it makes sense for us and the numbers work. We're not going to push. Fortunately, we're in a position. Teams have done a great job in lots and product positioning that we don't feel the need we have to push and drive on making a deal work that otherwise might not. But we haven't seen any specific rise in the past couple weeks. I mean that private builder market's not quite as liquid as the public side. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And one last one, if I may, the 11.2% to 11.5% on margin for 2017, is that a homebuilding margin or consolidated pre-tax? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : That's consolidated pre-tax. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Wanted to ask first about longer-term thoughts on SG&A. So it sounds like, based on the preliminary guide for fiscal 2017, dipped below 9%, which historically at kind of in the low watermark. And so, clearly, success at driving absorptions and some of the efficiencies have done wonders for that. If you think about other structural ways to reduce SG&A beyond those levels, we've heard some other builders talk about a couple different things. Just curious to get your thoughts on if there's anything else you're exploring outside of just continuing to drive absorptions? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The main driver, Mike, is absorption, so community-by-community, that's really where our expense structure resides. And as we continue to work to improve our absorptions, then we're able to drive better leverage on our SG&A structure both in the community and then all throughout our organization. And each year, we look at what our expectations are to improve on the top line and then we assess how much we can leverage SG&A. But as we expect to grow top line double digit, we should expect to leverage SG&A further as well. And so, yes, that does imply we will get down below 9%, and there's not a magic floor there. Each year, if we expect to grow, we would expect to continue to push more SG&A leverage. Certainly, some of the other things that have been talked about among other builders, we're doing a lot of those things as well. We're certainly taking advantage of technology wherever we can. We're looking to drive ways to be more efficient in all areas of our business. But there's not one magic bullet. We're looking to do \u2013 get more efficient on every line of our financials. And certainly, those things are part of it as well. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. And then second question, just going back to some of the Express discussion. And so certainly appreciate that kind of first-mover advantage has been pretty powerful in terms of even out through next year. You don't have a lot of competition as far as things that are coming to market. What about if we look at the land deals that you're looking at today, that would be 2018 or 2019? Obviously, people have taken notice of your success at the Express part of the market. So, are you showing up and seeing significantly more competition for those types of deals as you look out the next couple of years? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, we have competition in every factor of everything we do. I believe, ultimately, it comes down to execution. And right now, our people are out there executing. We are the group that \u2013 or the builder that I think makes the most sense to align with. And so we're finding the land deals we need to support the growth that we're seeking. So, do I think it's going to become more competitive? Maybe, but it's pretty competitive out there right now. We just got great people doing a great job. Michael G. Dahl - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n from Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Thank you and good morning and great job, guys. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Thanks, Alex. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : I was hoping maybe \u2013 I don't know if I missed this, Jessica, if you mentioned the stats for Emerald Homes, like the ones you mentioned for Express on closings, orders, revenues. Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : Sure. That will be in our supplementary data that we'll post at the end of the call. What we did say during our scripted comments were our homes priced greater than $500,000, were 7% of our homes closed and 16% of our home sales revenue. If you will get homes just marketed as Emerald, it's stayed constant at about 4% of our homes closed. But if you look at that in terms of units on a trailing12-month basis year-over-year, Emerald has actually grown by over 50% for us. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Okay. And the orders for that same group? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : The orders for Emerald were right at 4% as well. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Got it. And then, I guess, as far as your outlook for what you guys are calling affordable homes or Express, I'm kind of curious to see what your outlook is going forward in terms of community count growth in terms of just \u2013 do you feel that that's where the biggest opportunity is at? And I guess, the second follow-up question, where do you guys generically think we are in the cycle at this point? David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know where we are in the cycle. I can tell you it feels very good right now. And you look at the number of people and the country, you look at the housing formation, you look at job growth, all of those things are positive. So, we feel very good. And as far as \u2013 you had asked about the Emerald brand, I can tell you that... Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : The Express was the one where I was interested in, what your outlook is for that going forward. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. But the first \u2013 your first question was Emerald, right? Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Yes. Yes. Yes. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, as far as confidence for us, when we see that brand starting to accelerate along with how we're executing on the entry level, I mean, that to me is a pretty positive sign of what 2017 could be. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Got it. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : And I forgot \u2013 I wanted to answer my question. So, I forgot yours. So go ahead and just go ahead and ask your question again. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Yes. I guess, my question as it pertains to affordable homes and entry level, I feel like the entry level market has kind of been missing in action for the last few years, and you guys are one of the first to I guess kind of put your toe on the water a few years ago through the Express brand. And you've been growing it. I'm just kind of curious if you guys feel as bullish or more bullish today than you did three years ago about that segment. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : We're in 51 markets. We've got another 20-plus markets we can push into. We feel very good about the Express program. And in the markets that we have been open and operating, are we going to continue to see the kind of growth we've had? No, probably not, because there's \u2013 but the demand is \u2013 still even after three years, the demand is incredibly strong. So, it just feels good right now. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Well, great. Good job. Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you very much. Just wanted to ask about M&A and if you could share your thoughts on a potential for a larger-sized transaction than recent deals. We noticed your leverage levels are extremely low, which created some optionality. And regarding leverage, is that based on conservatism on the cycle or a change in longer-term view about optimal leverage, or is to create this optionality around M&A? Michael J. Murray - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think it's to create optionality around a lot of things, investing in the business, reducing debt. Having a lot of flexibility in the business is good, with specific regards to M&A. We continue to look at a lot of potential transactions, and we pursue those that make the most sense for us, whether they're larger or smaller, it's \u2013 we're kind of neutral to the size of the transaction. If it make sense at a small transaction, good team, good people, good positioning, we'll be interested. If it's a larger transaction that fits well with us and there's alignment in what makes sense with the other side, we would look at that as well. We're not shutting either off at any point in time. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks very much. And just on your guidance, in terms of the underlying economic expectations, are you assuming sort of a low to mid-single-digit growth rate in existing and new home sales? Jessica Hansen - Vice President of Investor Relations : We're assuming kind of more of the same in 2017 as what we saw in 2016. So when we say our expectations are based on today's housing market conditions, really just more of the same. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I know that you guys don't want to comment on necessarily where you think we are in the cycle, which is definitely fair. But how do you believe you're positioning D.R. Horton within the cycle given generating free cash for this year and the prior year? And also, how does that influence your view on potential incremental M&A or returning share or cash to shareholders, if you will? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Will, I think we're working to stay on a very balanced, flexible position. We're putting ourselves in position to continue to grow while we continue to see the good, stable healthy market conditions we see today. But as we're utilizing our cash to further strengthen our balance sheet, that's giving us even more flexibility to be opportunistic when we see opportunities to invest and whatever form that may be. And then, certainly, if things were not to continue as strong, we're in a very strong position there as well, whether \u2013 and so really great position to take advantage of M&A opportunities, to invest further on our business. Really, we're in a very good flexible position at the moment. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): And just one follow-up that's unrelated, in terms of demand pacing through the quarter, did you see any influence from a relatively hot June, inclement weather and a seasonally \u2013 a relatively warm spring, if you will? Bill W. Wheat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the sales demand side, no, not necessarily. Certainly, on the construction side, when you have a dry weather, there's no disruptions there. So, from that standpoint, that's always positive. But the summer is always hot. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks, guys. Great quarter. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David V. Auld - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in November to share our year-end results. And to the D.R. Horton team, great quarter, great year-to-date performance. Let's go finish this year and get started on 2017. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year-End 2016 Earnings Conference Call of D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 financial results. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there's no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K next week. After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary historical data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes current and historical data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on the call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team finished strong in 2016. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter increased 28% to $433 million, or $3.7 billion of revenue and our pre-tax operating margin improved 90 basis points to 11.6%. For the year, we delivered results in line with our original guidance we shared last summer with consolidated pre-tax income increasing 20% to $1.4 billion, or $12.2 billion of revenue. We closed 40,309 homes this year, which is an increase of 3,661 homes or 10% over last year. Our consolidated pre-tax margin for the full year of 2016 improved 70 basis points to 11.1%. Our return on inventory improved 260 basis points in 2016 to 15.4%. During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash from operations, bringing our total cash generated from operations to $618 million for the year and to $1.3 billion over the past two years. These results reflect consistent strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pre-tax profits while generating positive cash flows and improved returns, with a sales backlog of 11,475 homes at the end of September, positive sales trends in October, a well-stocked supply of land, lots and homes and the launch of our Freedom Homes brand we are well-positioned and looking forward to 2017. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Net income for the fourth quarter increased 19% to $284 million or $0.75 per diluted share compared to $239 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 28% to $433 million in the fourth quarter compared to $339 million in the year-ago quarter and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 34% to $405 million compared to $302 million in the prior year quarter. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 83%, near the high-end of the range we guided to on our third quarter call. As a result, our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 19% to $3.6 billion on 12,247 homes closed, up from $3.1 billion on 10,576 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $297,000 up 3% compared to the prior year, due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the fourth quarter, our homes sold increased 3% to 8,744 homes. On a 5% decline in our average active selling communities, our sales absorptions strongly improved by 8% over last year. Absorptions were up in five of our six regions. The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 7% from the year-ago quarter to $2.6 billion. Our average sales price on net sales orders increased 4% to $299,800. Our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 28%, in line with the year-ago quarter. The value of our backlog increased 9% from a year ago to $3.4 billion, with an average sales price per home of $299,600 and homes in backlog increased 8% to 11,475 homes. We are very pleased with our current sales pace and October sales were in line with our fiscal 2017 business plan, supporting our expectations for the year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: As announced during the fourth quarter, we are adding another brand to our product lineup, Freedom Homes offering a low-maintenance lifestyle at an affordable price for active adult buyers who want to live in an age-restricted or age-targeted community. Early customer response to Freedom Homes has been positive. We are currently offering Freedom Homes in eight markets in seven states and expect to have Freedom committees open in at least a third of our 78 operating markets by the end of fiscal 2017. As we work towards completion of our Express Homes rollout in fiscal 2017, we are excited about the expansion of Express into our Western markets where customer response has been just as strong as in our early markets. In the fourth quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 28% of our homes sold, 29% of homes closed and 20% of home sales revenue and, for the year, they accounted for 27% of homes sold, 26% of homes closed and 18% of home sales revenue. We also remain dedicated to offering homes for higher-end move-up and luxury buyers under both our D.R. Horton and Emerald Homes brands. In the fourth quarter, homes priced greater than $500,000 were 7% of our homes closed and 19% of our home sales revenue, and for the year, they accounted for 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sales revenue. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from the third quarter and up 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. The sequential improvement in our gross margin was primarily due to controlling cost increases, while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorptions. In the current housing environment, we expect our gross margins to continue to remain in a relatively consistent range of 19% to 21%, while balancing pace and price in each of our communities to optimize returns on our inventory investments. We have been able to achieve a gross margin slightly higher than 20% over the last two quarters. We may still experience quarterly fluctuations ranging from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, purchase accounting and the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.8%, flat with the prior year quarter. SG&A expense for the quarter included $15.5 million to write off an acquired trade name that we are no longer using and to increase our legal reserves for a recent court decision which we plan to appeal. Homebuilding SG&A for the full year improved 20 basis points to 9.3% compared to 9.5% in 2015, as our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2017. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was $28 million. For the year, financial services pre-tax income was $89.1 million on $296 million of revenues, representing a 30% pre-tax operating margin. Our financial services profits for the fourth quarter and fiscal year decreased from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in our estimated loan loss reserves in the fourth quarter and increased overhead costs to comply with additional regulations. 94% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the fourth quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 50% in the year-ago quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 718 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: During the quarter, our total number of homes in inventory decreased by 9%, a normal seasonal trend after our strongest home closing quarter of the year. We finished the year with 23,100 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 11,800 of our total homes were spec homes, with 8,300 in various stages of construction and 3,500 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 17% more homes in inventory, which places us in a strong position at the start of the year to achieve double-digit growth in revenues in 2017. Our fourth quarter investment in lots, land and development totaled $747 million, of which $467 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $280 million was for land development. For the year, our total investment totaled $2.7 billion, an increase of 23% from 2015. We plan to increase our investments to replenish our land and lot supply in 2017 at a rate to support our expected growth in revenues. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At September 30, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 205,000 lots, of which 113,000 or 55% are owned and 92,000 or 45% are controlled through option contracts. 75,000 of our total lots controlled are finished, of which 30,000 are owned and 45,000 are optioned. Consistent with our focus on building strong relationships with land developers, our option lot position has increased 65% from a year ago, while our overall lot position increased 18%. Our 205,000 lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and is sufficient lot supply to support solid growth in both sales and closings. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our inactive land held for development of $138 million at the end of the year represents 7,300 lots, down 20% from June and down 34% from a year ago. We continue to work through each of our remaining inactive land parcels to improve cash flows and returns and we expect that our land held for development will continue to decline. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $4 million in land option charges for write-offs of earnest money deposits and due diligence costs for projects that we do not intend to pursue. We also recorded $11.4 million of inventory impairment charges, the majority of which were in our Southwest and East regions. These charges primarily related to strategic decisions to sell land. We will continue to evaluate our inventories for potential impairment, which may result in future impairment charges, but the timing and magnitude of these charges will fluctuate. During the fourth quarter, we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.2 million related to one of our operating divisions in our Southeast region. Our total goodwill balance after this impairment is $80 million. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In September, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Wilson Parker Homes for $91.9 million of cash, which includes a holdback payment and an estimated post-closing adjustment. Wilson Parker primarily operates in Atlanta and Augusta, Georgia, and Raleigh, North Carolina. The assets acquired included approximately 380 homes in inventory, 490 lots and control of approximately 1,850 additional lots through option contracts. We also acquired a sales order backlog of 308 homes valued at $74.1 million. Our fourth quarter results include 66 net sales orders and 81 homes closed from Wilson Parker subsequent to the acquisition date. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: During the fourth quarter, we generated $529 million of cash flow from operations. For the full year, we generated $618 million, above the high-end of our guidance range. At September 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.3 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $882 million available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 690 basis points from a year ago to 29.2%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $2.8 billion and we have a total of $350 million of senior notes that will mature in fiscal 2017. We finished the year with a shareholders' equity balance of $6.8 billion and book value per common share of $18.21, up 14% from a year ago. Our priorities for cash flow utilization center around being opportunistic while remaining disciplined. Our top priorities for fiscal 2017 include investing in our homebuilding business where opportunities to generate acceptable returns exist, business acquisitions to further consolidate market share, paying off debt at maturity and consistent dividend to shareholders. Based on our solid balance sheet, liquidity, profitability and cash flows, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.10 per share. We currently expect to distribute approximately $150 million in dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2017. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Looking forward, our expectations for next year are consistent with what we shared on our July call and are based on today's housing market conditions. In fiscal 2017, we still expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.2% to 11.5%. We also expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion and to close between 43,500 and 45,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2017 will be around 20% with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate that our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be approximately 9.0% with the first two quarters of the year higher than 9% and the third and fourth quarters lower than 9%. We expect our annual financial services operating margin to be around 30% with the first two quarters of the year lower than 30% and the third and fourth quarters higher than 30%. We're forecasting a fiscal 2017 income tax rate of approximately 35% and an annual average diluted share count of approximately 380 million shares. We also continue to expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the third consecutive year in a range of approximately $300 million to $500 million. Our fiscal 2017 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season and we plan to update our expectations as necessary each quarter, as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clearer. For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, we expect that our number of homes closed will approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 76% to 80%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be around 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be in the range of 10% to 10.2% of home building revenues. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In closing, the strength of our team and operating platform across the country allowed us to deliver full year 2016 results in line with the guidance we provided at the start of last year. While growing our revenue and pre-tax profit at a double-digit pace again this year, we generated $618 million of positive cash flow from operations and improved our annual return on inventory by 260 basis points to 15.4%. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate positive cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finish lot and land position and, most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and remarkable accomplishments this year, and we look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2017. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please ask one question and one follow-up. Our first question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, my first question, just thinking about the job you guys have done on the entry-level and you guys have had a tremendous first-mover advantage there over the last year or two. And as I listen to all the other builders on their conference calls this quarter, almost everybody's talking about entry-level increasing their exposure there, opening new communities. And when I look at your order numbers this quarter, which came in lower than where you've been trending in recent quarters, curious if you're seeing any increased competition there that might have affected that sales pace, maybe some more incentives as calendar reporting quarter builders kind of gear up for some closings there? With your guidance staying unchanged, it sounds like October bounced back, so any more color you can give on the sales pace and the competition you're seeing on entry-level would be great. Thank you. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Alan, this is David Auld. From the competitive standpoint, I feel like we're as well or better positioned today as we were starting last year. So I think it's a fourth quarter sales number, we just had a lot going on and tough comp the year before, and it put us right in where we thought we'd be for the year. So if we look at October, October looks good, so. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. And I appreciate that David. And then, I think you mentioned, I might have misheard this, but your community count was down about 5% year-over-year, if that was correct? And I know you've been talking about that growth resuming there to something more in the low to mid-single-digit range. So just curious if that came in below your expectations in the quarter and when you would expect to see that inflect positively? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Hi, Alan. You're correct. Our community count was down 5% year-over-year and it was down 2% sequentially. It's one of the hardest things for us to predict, so we don't give formal guidance on community count. As we continue to get more information and we are into November of the year, right now, we expect our community count to be relatively stable versus the current levels, which would infer that it would continue to be down on a year-over-year basis in somewhere of a low to mid-single-digit range like we experienced this quarter. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Alan, this is David, our expectation is double-digit growth, and I can tell you that the operating plan going forward supports the guidance we've given you, so \u2013 and the expectation on them (22:03) next year, so. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And our targets are all based on an annual basis, so we're really focused on that double-digit growth in revenues and pre-tax profits annually. Quarter-to-quarter, you have some variation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So can you \u2013 the can (22:30) rate normally kind of creeps up in the fourth quarter consistent with what we saw last year, but I'm just trying to tease out labor constraints and all these types of things, because it seems like while you refer to backlog conversion, if you use your units under construction ratio, you're actually coming in a bit lower closings as a percent of units under construction than you normally do. Is there something that's impacting that trend? It seems like you would have had perhaps more units. I'm not sure, if you can just comment on that. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We hit the high end of our guidance range, so I would say we delivered on what we anticipated and we're excited about the fact we have 17% more homes under construction today going into the year to position us very well to deliver on those targets for 2017. But Q4 was right in line with the guidance we gave. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Oh, no. I'm saying for 1Q. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: That are 76% to 80% backlog conversion? Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Yeah, (23:37). Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's about in line with what we experienced last year and what we expect to do in Q1, which is a nice increase on a year-over-year basis, in terms of absolute units. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Last year Q1, in fiscal 2016, Q1 was a 76% backlog conversion rate and with this implied conversion rate, that would imply high single-digit to low double-digit growth in Q1 versus last year. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Well, I'll follow up on that. But then, I guess, for the order pace, which we look at seasonally for you all, it seems like it came in just a little lighter than your normal seasonality. And I need to see your supplemental today, but certainly compared to 2015, 2014, and 2013, it was a little lower. Was there any one region that was kind of driving that? And I know in your supplemental you'll have that. I just wonder if you could publicly comment on that before the supplemental comes out. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, we commented that five of six of our regions were up in terms of those absorptions, and so, really, no, it wasn't really one region that sticks out at all. We're making sure that this time of the year that we're positioning ourselves with our inventory levels and by community to be prepared to deliver on what we're going to do next year and in each community, they deliver the closings that we expected in the quarter, and we're in the position we expected to be to deliver fiscal 2017. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the only region we were down in was our Southwest region, which is our smallest operating region. It's only a couple of markets, the biggest one being Phoenix, which we've talked about the last couple of quarters where we're repositioning and are excited about introducing Express into that market, so we do expect our absorption to start to pick up, but this quarter, that was the only region that we saw decline in our absorption. So very excited with what we continue to see across the country. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Just one last question on the orders front or a couple questions on the orders front. Could you give us some \u2013 could you quantify to some degree what October looks like maybe either in percentage terms or versus the fiscal fourth quarter? And then, when you look at the fiscal fourth quarter, it was the easiest comp that you had of the year and you had some pretty good growth rates the prior quarters. As you look at the market, what do you think was changing versus maybe the last two or three quarters, the growth rates that you posted? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Stephen, with regard to our October sales, we feel really good about our October sales. We were up over the prior year, in line with where we thought we'd be, and it's definitely supporting the outlook we have for the year, in terms of underlying market factors, we're not seeing significant changes. We continue to see both in looking at the numbers as well as talking to field, visiting the field operations, continued strong demand across the brands, and we're not in any way alarmed. We're in fact very encouraged and positive about the way 2017 looks and our positioning for 2017. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, the second question I had for you, your lot option strategy, you put a lot more under option. As you look at moving forward, I assume you'd prefer to continue to do that, but as you look at the market in actuality, what's that market giving you? Can you grow that percentage of options meaningfully in 2017 or was this something that was just opportunistic that came through? And then, could you just talk a little bit about what the trademark was and why that transpired? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Stephen, with regard to the option contracts, we did see tremendous progress we've been making in that program. It's not any one opportunistic situation. It's been market by market, operating division by operating division, working with local developers to improve our option lot portfolio. We made a 65% increase this year over last year. I don't think we'll see that kind of growth going forward in the option position, but I do think we're going to get it closer to a 50/50 balance from our 55/45 balance under option today. I'll let Bill talk to the trade name. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. And Stephen, with respect to the trade name, this related to one of the acquisitions that we did two or three years ago. We have recently changed over all of those communities to our core brands, to our Horton Express brands. And so, no, we're no longer using that name, and so, we wrote off the remaining balance that we had that had not yet been amortized. So, pretty ordinary course of business as we integrate acquisitions over the years following the acquisition date. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And Stephen, on this lot option program, we're just being good partners for the people that have the ability to put lots on the ground. And when we look at our driving philosophy on flag by flag, month by month absorptions, I mean, that makes underwriting land and lot option contracts a much easier program for the people that have borrowed money to put the lots on the ground. So we're just being nicer and we're going to continue to be nice. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hello. This is actually Tim Daley on for Nishu. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding the backlog conversion ratio. So it seemed to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and you're guiding for it to be up in the first quarter 2017 as well. So some of your peers have been mentioning labor shortages being a tailwind \u2013 or a headwind to this metric rather, but it doesn't seem to be the case for you in 4Q and apparently not in 1Q. I just wanted to dig a little bit into this and mainly regarding the Express versus the D.R. Horton brand communities, just because assuming that the Express communities have a bit quicker cycle times, could you just explain a bit of this mix to us and what do you expect trending into 2017? Thank you. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So a lot there in that question. Let me try to take some parts of it. Looking at labor, certainly labor is tight across the markets. We feel that our market positioning, the leading market positions that we have give us access to great labor partners, and we're able to provide a lot of work for those. As David mentioned before, running a consistent absorption space community by community helps us in negotiating and giving that labor a secured place to go to work every day. But we do hear that our guys are working very hard every day to secure adequate labor, provide quality homes, and we monitor our build times brand by brand, and that would be the best way we would have to see if we're having a global impact of labor shortages in our deliveries and we're not seeing our build times really lengthen or cycle times extend for how long it takes us to build a house. So we're very pleased. Our guys are doing a great job and gals doing a great job performing in that regard. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And Tim, in addition to being very focused on building that option lot position, we have a focus on improving our backlog conversion, and that's what you're starting to see come through. A big part of that is our Express brand, but we're doing better in Horton as well and are going to continue to try to drive a better backlog conversion as we move forward, although there can be some choppiness to that from quarter-to-quarter as well. Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Just quickly, just to clarify, so was both Express and Horton up year-over-year on a backlog conversion by brands percentage in the fourth quarter? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We don't have that in front of us right now, Tim, but I'll be happy to take a look at it and get back to you. Timothy Daley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. No problem. Thank you though. And then my second question, just digging a bit into the margin guidance for financial services revenue, seems to be \u2013 it's down year-over-year from 2016 to 2015, and you essentially are expecting it to be flat in 2017. What was the main factor that influenced the reduction year-over-year into 2016 and what gives you the confidence that these margins will stabilize into 2017? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Really, two primary things, Tim. Last year, we saw abnormally high margins in the financial services business as the industry started to price in a lot of the extra costs that were coming related to regulations, and this year, those costs came in. So we saw a significant increase in compliance costs in our business there as we implemented all the new rules and regulations and that certainly impacted our overhead cost there as well. And then one other big factor for us more specifically, we did have an incremental increase in our reserves for our loan portfolio in fiscal 2016, and in fiscal 2015, we actually had reductions in those reserves. So you had an opposite effect in our overall margins in the business 2015 versus 2016. But really, the run rate of around 30% has been historically a very normal operating range for financial services, so we feel like in fiscal 2017, we should be back about to a normal level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore. Please proceed with your questions. Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI : Thanks very much. Can you hear me? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, sure. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes. Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks very much. So yeah, you've reiterated your outlook for double-digit growth, and I guess, I just wanted to make sure, does that include an assumption for ASP growth? And in that vein, I was wondering if you could give us a little more clarity as to whether the community count growth in the quarter was more hampered at high-end communities or lower end communities or were there any particular regions that sort of stand out in terms of where you're having a little bit more of a harder time than others in growing that community count. Thanks. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Stephen, if you look at our guidance for next year, our unit growth, the range there is 8% to 13% growth and the revenue number is at 10% to 14% growth. So there would be very slight assumption of price appreciation which is about what we've seen, very low single-digit at best. So not much, but a little bit. And then the second part... Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, in terms of our community count, we have seen that decline pretty much across the board, which is what caused our 5% decline on a year-over-year basis, on an average basis. It's in line with what our business plan looks like and we continue to drive better absorptions out of the vast majority of our communities which is why we continue to see our sales improvement and the majority of our business plan in fiscal 2017 is just like 2016. We do expect to continue to drive better absorption out of the majority of our flags. Express will continue to help us with doing that and the launch and the beginning rollout of Freedom Homes, which is a very similar business model to Express, is going to help as well. Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI : Absolutely. Great. I guess the second question... David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Stephen, it's David Auld. Our long-term goal is double-digit growth. So we are going to be positioning to maximize our returns generating double-digit growth. So the community count is going to balance out. As our absorptions have picked up, it's come down, but as a cycle in the market, we will be adding communities to support that growth. Stephen S. Kim - Evercore ISI : Great. That's encouraging. With respect to the cycle, I was wondering if you could comment on one other issue which relates to a build-to-order versus more of a spec model approach to the production. We've heard some people say that build-to-order model has certain advantages, I was curious if you could comment on your opinion generally as to the advantages of spec model versus a build-to-order, and if there's any sort of perspective on where we are in the cycle, that might inform your buyers one way or the other. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, to me, build-to-order spec depends on where you are in the cycle and what is the biggest constraint in the market. If selling the house is the biggest constraint, then you're going to do whatever the buyers want you to do, and it pushes you into that build-to-order model. But if labor is the biggest constraint, if location and land position is the biggest constraint, then you're trying to create the most efficiency you can and best value you can for the buyer and that is a production start spec model. And if you look at our margins over the last two years, three years, they're the most stable in the industry. And it's because we are very disciplined in when we start, when we sell and when we close these homes and create the most efficient, maximize the labor trade that we have and that's why we are doing a better job than our competitors out there, so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Jason A. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. It's Jason in for Mike. I was hoping if you could give us a little more color on the pricing and incentive trends that you saw that occurred through the quarter across the different product lines. How much is your pricing up versus your land and construction cost and which markets do you currently have the most pricing power right now as you're looking across your footprint? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We continue to see a nice increase in our revenues per square foot, Jason. They were up about 4% both year-over-year and sequentially, and our costs both year-over-year and sequentially were only up about 2%. So that is part of the gross margin pickup you're seeing, being offset by slightly higher land costs flowing through. But really, it's across the board, you continue to see our Express price point move up, primarily driven by a change in mix, as we roll in some of those western markets, as I mentioned in the scripted comments, but we do have pricing power out there today, because there's a lack of inventory particularly at those entry-level price points. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And right now, Jason, we continue to see very consistent margins across all of our brands. They're all within a very tight range around our company average, so no major differential in margins, cost or pricing dynamics, really in any of our brands right now. Jason A. Marcus - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then, just in terms of the gross margin, obviously, a nice improvement from last year. I wanted to see how much of that was driven by mix from a geographic or a product standpoint. And then, as you have been underwriting new land deals, have you been able to maintain a consistent underwriting standard or have there been any adjustments as you look across the platform? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We really haven't seen a big differentiator in the driver of margin. We've seen kind of general improvement across the platform. As David mentioned before, or Bill, our brands have produced very consistent margins, close to the company average. With regard to our underwriting hurdles, we've maintained the same underwriting hurdles we've had and our primary focus is return on the inventory investment that we'll have in a community and a return of the initial committed capital of 24 months that we've been talking about for a few years now. So we've been able to maintain those disciplines and still invest significantly in replenishing our land and lot supply. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. The first question I had was just on south central orders being down slightly year-over-year. I was wondering if you can just give us a little bit more color by major city in Texas. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Overall, Texas has been strong for several years now, and especially, Dallas Fort Worth area certainly stands out, continues to be a very strong level. Certainly, the growth rate has moderated versus where we were, but still maintaining at a very strong level. Our sales in Houston, the second largest in Texas, was up year-over-year. So we've continued to see that at a very strong level, as we continue to move back down the price curve and making sure that we're staying at an affordable level in the Houston market. Austin, San Antonio, the other two major markets also just very solid consistent results, and when you're comparing versus where those cities and where the state of Texas was last year, that's at a very strong level of performance. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we think about the gross margin, just curious what you're expecting in terms of purchase accounting impact from Wilson. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Very minimal. If you look at our supplemental information, we've had really no quarters more than about a 10-basis-point to 20-basis-point impact and certainly don't expect any more than that going forward as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. Good morning. On the mortgage side, I think you said 57% captured, 48% FHA VA for the company overall, right? Wondering if you can break that out a little bit more on Express. Are you capturing more of the Express buyer? And I know there's been, obviously, some loan limit issues across the country, but is your FHA percentage higher at Express or lower than the company average? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure, Jack. The FHA percentage is higher, I don't have a specific number in front of me and I don't have the capture rate for Express in front of me, but I do believe that it's higher than the company average as well. I'll be happy to take a look at that and get back to you after the call. Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. And then, switching over to Freedom, I'd imagine that's a different \u2013 obviously, a different buyer profile. So how are they financing? Is it heavier cash? Is it too soon to tell? Is there anything noteworthy out of sort of the Freedom buyer in terms of how they're paying for their homes? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think, generally, we're pretty early with that launch to have any kind of generalizations to say what that buyer has been doing. We did see in a lot of our Express communities in Florida a lot of that buyer profile coming in with either very significant down payments, low mortgages or even cash buyers. So we're excited to see how that unfolds, but we'll have to get back with you as we see that happen. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Just further on the mortgage market, we saw from the Fed yesterday, their Loan Officer Survey that perhaps there's been some modest or moderate loosening in terms of mortgage lending. Is that something that you would say that you've seen, especially maybe among that Express buyer? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: To the extent there's been any loosening, it's been very modest, really similar to what we said over the last couple of years. Any loosening has been very modest. Nothing that's moved the needle significantly in the market, but we would certainly expect that over time, probably, we continue to see a little bit more loosening, as the economy improves, as the mortgage market continues to improve. Susan Marie Maklari - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, in terms of thinking about geographic footprint and sort of maybe expanding in certain markets on the back of the Wilson acquisition, just are there any areas that you feel like maybe you're perhaps relatively under-represented in and would be interested in further expanding? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: That's something we look at regularly. We have talked a bit internally that we've been working to improve our operations in the Northeast and feel like we're making good progress there. And over the next couple of years, we think we're going to see some good results there. As well in our Southwest, the Phoenix markets are starting to come back a little bit. So we've been making some more investments there and increasing our community counts there. So we'd expect us to see some pick-up in our Southwest as well. And beyond that, we look at potential business acquisitions, we look at potential market startups, but we don't have anything new to announce there at the moment. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Just two things. Curious, first of all, on where we are in the cycle, how you're thinking about managing your land investment. Obviously, I heard your comments about option land, but curious how you're thinking about managing through that at this point. And then, secondly, you talked about Freedom becoming one-third of the market \u2013 in one-third of your markets by the end of the year. Curious how \u2013 if that is incremental to what you're doing with Express, if that's going to take lots from Express or if we should expect for that price point or that piece of your business to grow even incrementally from where you are with Express? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, from the Express, Freedom standpoint, we're not thinking this is just going to replace Express positions. We do believe this Freedom brand is a good vehicle to drive growth and support our double-digit growth across the company. So in the rollout, the flag count, what was the \u2013 I'm sorry, what was the other question? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Cycle. Where we are at in the cycle. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Cycle. Well, I think we've got a good 2017 position for it and in my travels, Mike's travels, Don Horton's travels, the feeling in the market, the attitude, the excitement of our people, 2017 feels like it's going to be a very good year for us. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And beyond that, from a land positioning standpoint, we're replacing lots and we're expanding where we're driving higher returns, and we're going to continue to do that. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: How much of that \u2013 if I could just follow up on that, how much of that is the market and how much of that is that you have positioned yourself optimally to participate in what feels like is the strongest piece of the market? Can you differentiate between that? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's not just the Express market that feels good right now. It's the Horton brand feels good. We've gotten a lot better at executing our Emerald offering, product offering. And I guess I spent the month of September driving the Carolinas and looking at our flags and talking to our people. We've got a business plan for the Carolinas. I'll be very surprised if they don't exceed that plan significantly. I say it all the time, it's just good to be us. I don't have a \u2013 obviously, we can't operate in a vacuum, so the overall market is strong. But we are so well-positioned today that it really is just good to be D.R. Horton. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Megan McGrath from MKM Partners. Please proceed with your question. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Good morning. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the cost side. You mentioned controlling your costs better and that was part of your outperformance on the gross margin. So just curious if you could give any more color on that. Is it pushing back against the suppliers more in terms of price increases or is it more sort of operational in nature? Would love some more color and detail on how you're controlling your costs in this environment. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, Megan, what we've been doing is we've been working with national trade accounts. We've been working with suppliers in that regard to optimize our buying efficiencies. We've been with large market shares in many of our markets, most of our markets, we're able to work with labor and get very competitive pricing there. But we're also looking at ways to be more efficient executing a business plan in a neighborhood that drives an absorption rate that allows for the suppliers and the labor partners to be efficient with their business and give us pricing that is reflective of that efficiencies. At the same time, we've been able to reduce incentives or raise prices once we achieved those absorption paces. And I think those two factors have been very helpful to our margins over the past few quarters. They were very, very, very flat for several quarters in a row and we're starting to see some of the benefit of that execution and that discipline we've had in the field. Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC : Okay, great. That's helpful. And I apologize if I missed this, but can you give us an update on the rollout of Express in California? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're still in the early stages, but certainly are increasing community counts out there, Northern, Southern and Central California. And so, we expect that to be definitely a source of our growth in fiscal 2017. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Very excited about California. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Will Randow from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I just had a couple of follow-ups from prior questions. I guess, first, from a seasonality perspective, gross margin was actually up sequentially in this fourth quarter, and that's not the historical trend where you're typically down 50 bps. So I guess, can you talk about what type of price increases you were able to implement over the past quarter or so to drive that? You mentioned in the prior question, mix, but if you could talk a little bit more about that. And what read-through there is for your 2017 guidance for gross margin. Stated differently, is 20% flat kind of, I'll call it, a low-ball number or how do you think about that? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So we've been very pleased, as we said in our scripted comments, with what we've been able to do the last couple of quarters. It's really been a cumulative effect of our efforts and really just driving that consistent absorption to be able to increase our margins. So when we look at 2017, we still do expect the biggest driver of our bottom line to be incremental SG&A leverage due to the higher volumes. But if the spring's good and we continue to meet our and exceed our business plan, then there could be some upside to our gross margin. Where we sit today, we feel comfortable saying it'll be right around that 20% with some quarterly fluctuations that could be in the 19% to 21% range, because there are some things outside of just price and land, lot and labor and materials that can impact our gross margin, which is why we do continue to give you that slightly broader range and stick with around 20% for the full fiscal year. But we'll update that, Will, as we continue to move throughout the year and have better visibility to the spring. Will Randow - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, as a follow-up, if you could hit specifically on \u2013 if you put out what percentage of communities got priced this quarter and also share your inflation trends in the three buckets separately of lumber, labor and land. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No, Will, we don't really have that information as far as percentage where we raise price. That's managed at the local level. But overall, our revenue per square foot did go up 4.4% on a year-over-year basis and 3.7% on a sequential basis. So we're clearly seeing a fair amount of price appreciation in a fair sample of our communities across our business today. And to the extent that this is there and we got the opportunity to continue to do that or reduce incentives, we'll continue to do that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the spec home versus to-be-built sale question just a little bit, I mean just on an absolute count, it looks like your unsold units are up a little north of 20% year-on-year and on a per community basis, you're probably up maybe closer to 25%. Are you seeing a narrowing of the margin differential between specs and the contract sales to the point where that's what's giving you a lot more comfort to raise your unsold unit counts? Or is this more of a means to keep your labor more occupied and keep the trade base busy with the tightness in the labor market? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's more latter, community by community, we manage our inventory levels, manage our production, in order to hit the production schedules and the sales pace that we're expecting going forward and we feel very good about our positioning right now. When we look at our overall units and our completed units, they're right in line with our business plans. In fact, when we look at our aging on those, which some of that information will be in our filings later on, our aging is actually improving, so that's something we monitor very closely as well. So overall, we feel good about our positioning. Buck Horne - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And just kind of separately, have you guys talked or been in any sort of partnerships with any of the \u2013 or any single-family rental operators about working with them to whether it's at the tail end of a community's lifecycle, let one of these rental providers come in and buy a group of homes, or partnering with \u2013 maybe doing contracts for a larger chunk of production? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We have not been in any kind of a formal or broad agreement or discussions with anybody about that. I would imagine in some communities we have sold a home here and there, to single-family rental companies of various sizes, whether it's an individual investor or a large public company. But it's not a significant component of our business today nor do we have any national type relationship or regional relationships. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could comment on what you would expect for backlog conversion rates to trend throughout the year if the Wilson acquisition has any impact on that and if just overall you think it will be similar to 2016. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Jade, we really only have good visibility a quarter out on that. So we provided our Q1 conversion, which would be a slight improvement on our conversion versus last year in Q1, and certainly, our goals are to continue to get more efficient and part of that will be to continue to improve our backlog conversion and so that would certainly be part of our goals for the year, but we will only provide the guidance quarter-by-quarter, as we have visibility to the upcoming quarter. Jade Rahmani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: On average selling price, are you expecting it to remain relatively stable mid-$300,000 mark? Or should we expect a downtick mix based on the growth in entry-level and the Freedom initiatives? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Hard one to predict, Jade, but we have seen the ability to continue to move that ASP up in spite of Express being a bigger piece of our business, so as we look forward to 2017, our best educated guess is it will be flat to slightly up. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And a special thanks to all of D.R. Horton team; outstanding job closing out 2016 and positioning for continued success in 2017. You are the best of the best, and I thank you for all you do. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

The supplementary information includes current and historical supporting data on our homebuilding return on inventory, gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team produced strong results in our first quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 32% to $318 million on a revenue increase of 20% to $2.9 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 100 basis points to 11%. We experienced a 20% improvement in our absorption per community as home sales increased 15% compared to last year. These results reflect strength of our operational teams and diverse product offering across our broad national footprints, as well as solid market conditions. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits, while generating annual positive cash flows and increase in returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 15.9%, up 290 basis points from 30% a year ago. And we expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows from operations for the year. With 24,500 homes in inventory at the end of December and an ample supply of land and lot, we are well positioned for the upcoming springs selling season and the remainder of 2017. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income for the first quarter increased 31% to $207 million or $0.55 per diluted share compared to $158 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 32% to $318 million in the first quarter versus to $241 million a year-ago quarter. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 28% to $294 million compared to $229 million. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was 82%, above the high-end of the range we guided to on our fourth quarter call. As a result, our first quarter home sales revenues increased 20% to $2.8 billion on 9,404 homes closed, up from $2.3 billion on 8,061 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $297,000, up 2% compared to last year. This quarter, entry level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand, accounted for 28% of homes closed and 20% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher end move up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 or 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sale revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is still in the early stages of roll-out and customer response in the eight markets we are open has been positive. We still expect to have Freedom communities open in the third of our same day operating markets by the end of the year. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 17% from the prior year quarter to $2.8 billion. And homes sold increased 15% to 9,241 homes on a 5% decline in our average active selling community. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $299,100. And the cancellation rate for the first quarter was 22%, consistent with the prior year quarter. The value of our backlog increased 7% from a year ago to $3.4 billion with an average sales price per home of $300,900. And homes in backlog increased 6% to 11,312 homes. Mike? Mike Murray : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 19.8% compared to 19.9% in the prior year quarter and 20.5% in the fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points sequential change in gross profit margin was due to higher warranty and litigation costs this quarter. In the current housing market, we expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenue, improved 70 basis points to 9.5% compared to 10.2% in the prior year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports current and future growth. We expect our SG&A, as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, to be lower in 2017 than in 2016. However, we expect the improvement for the full year to be less than the 70 basis points improvement we achieved this quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter increased to $24.2 million from $12.4 million in the prior year quarter, driven by growth in revenue and an improved operating margin. 93% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of our home buyers, up from 51% in the same quarter last year. FHA and DA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume compared to 50% in the prior year quarter. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan to value ratio is 88%. First time home buyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company compared to 43% in the first quarter last year. David? David Auld : During the quarter, our total number of homes in inventory increased by 6%, a normal seasonal trend as we approach the spring selling season. We ended the first quarter with 24,500 homes in inventory, of which 1,600 were models, 13,400 of our total homes were spec homes with 9,700 in various stages of construction and 3,700 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 14% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the spring selling season and to achieve double digit growth in revenues in 2017. Our first quarter investments in lots, land and developer, totaled $847 million, of which, $552 million was for finished lots and land and $295 million was for land development. We plan to increase our investment in our land and lot supply this year at a rate to support our expected growth in revenues. Mike? Mike Murray : At December 31, 2016, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 213,000 lots, of which, 119,000 or 56% are owned and 94,000 or 44% are controlled through option contracts. 77,000 of our total lots are finished, of which, 32,000 are owned and 45,000 are option. Our option lot position increased 54% from a year ago, while our overall lot position increased 20%. Our 213,000 lot portfolio is the strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, and a sufficient lot supply to support our future growth. Bill? Bill Wheat : At December 31st, our homebuilding liquidity included $1.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $888 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 690 basis points from a year ago to 28.6%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at December 31st was $2.8 billion, and we have a total of $350 million of senior notes that will mature this year in May. Subsequent to quarter end, Moody\u2019s upgraded our corporate credit ratings to BAA3, and we now have investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies. At December 31st, our shareholders' equity was $7 billion and book value per share was $18.70, up 14% from a year ago. Our priorities for cash flow utilization are center around being opportunistic, while remain disciplined. Our top priorities for fiscal 2017; include, continuing to consolidate market share by both investing in our homebuilding business and through strategic acquisitions; paying off $350 million of our senior notes on maturity in May; and providing consistent dividends to our shareholders. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, our expectations for 2017 are consistent with what we shared on our November call, and are based on current market conditions. We still expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.2% to 11.5%. We also expect consolidated revenues of between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion, and to close between 43,500 and 45,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for fiscal 2017 will be around 20% with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be approximately 9.0% with the second quarter of the year higher than 9% and the third and fourth quarters lower than 9%. We expect our annual financial services operating margin to be around 30%. We are forecasting a fiscal 2017 income tax rate of approximately 35% and an annual average diluted share count of approximately 380 million shares. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the third consecutive year in a range of approximately $300 million to $500 million. Our fiscal 2017 results will be significantly impacted by the strengths of the spring selling season, and we will update our expectations as necessary each quarter as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clear. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 88% to 92%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be around 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% of homebuilding revenues. David? David Auld : In closing, our first quarter growth in sales, closings and profits, and the improvement in our pre-tax profit margin are the result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry leading market share. We remain focused on growing both revenues and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D. R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land positions and most importantly, our tremendous team across the country. We'd like to thank the entire D. R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we look forward to continuing to grow and improve our operations in 2017. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. We ask that you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Thank you, congratulations guys. I'm sure you're going to hear it several times today, but great quarter. Maybe we'll just start with the orders, because you're going to probably get that question 100 times also. But can you talk a little bit about the trends that you saw through the quarter? Did you see any impact from the rates, from the election, product type disparity, what was going on? And then, whatever type of commentary you want to give post quarter what we've seen in January so far. David Auld : We were very pleased with the quarter. And we saw very strong improvement in our absorptions, community-by-community. Throughout the quarter, we continue to see a good response to our positioning. We were much better positioned coming into this first quarter this year than we had been, and we were able to execute against that. The market therefore is a very solid market. I wouldn't say we saw significant deviations within the quarter month-to-month. It was a pretty consistent result for us. In January, the Cowboy lost. So, in this part of the world, the selling season is kind of starting now. So, we're excited about the silver-lining on that cloud for us. But we continue to see good sales trends in January, very early into spring. And we'll certainly keep you updated as things progress, and we get back with you in April on that one. Stephen East : And follow up the absorption one, can you sustain it. And then with the rate move that you've seen so far, I assume that you're seeing very few that are not qualifying. Are you starting to see any trade-down in product? And at what rate, do you think you would start to see maybe some of those Express buyers have to drop-out of the market? David Auld : Stephen, it's always good to be, in my mind anyway, the price leader in rising interest rate environment, because you can\u2019t afford 300. And if you've got a product to 250, you can still support this. So, we like our positioning. As far as absorption for our community, at some point, no, you're not going to be able to sustain and continue. But our focus has been driving to 20% ROI. And so, we're going to drive absorption levels and improve ROI. And at some point, we're going to max out. The return we can make up of lag, and at that point, we will add flags. Jessica Hansen : And for fiscal '17, we feel very comfortable that we can continue to drive further improvement in our absorption to offset any community count decline to generate 8% to 13% increase in closings that we\u2019ve guided too for the year. So, clearly, we\u2019re off to a strong start. And we can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter and how we get there for the year. As you saw, our sales were outside of that up 8% to 13% range. We could have a quarter where our sales are under that 8% to 13% range, but we feel very comfortable that for the full year, our closings will be up at least 8% to 13%. David Auld : Stephen, we wouldn\u2019t guide up double-digit if we weren\u2019t confident that we could drive that level of absorption. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Well, I am going to just add my congrats as well, because it's clearly, while you orders were very strong and you also executed very well below the top line also, so congratulations on a good execution this quarter. My first question actually revolves around cost control. I mean, I know that you are always focused on leveraging your scale with your vendors. But I think that recently you\u2019ve conducted a pretty significant rebidding process with some of your suppliers. And I was wondering if you would be willing to share what you think the overall savings opportunity might be from those conversations? Bill Wheat : Stephen, we\u2019re constantly rebidding our suppliers and our vendors across the board. We\u2019ve had several pushes over the last several years really in which we pushed hard on rebidding. And so, yes, that\u2019s a continual effort for it, and we\u2019re continually working to mitigate certainly any cost increases and improve our cost wherever we can. On a year-over-year basis, our costs, our stick and brick cost which were put, were up only 2%, which is certainly a more moderate than we saw a couple of years ago. And so we\u2019ve been able to keep our revenue growth per square foot exceeding our cost per square foot on the stick and brick basis, which is certainly helping us going forward. We\u2019re seeing lot cost start to increase, lot costs were up 9% on a per square foot basis this quarter. So it\u2019s a very -- we\u2019re seeing very good results from our efforts to control our stick and brick, which is helping to keep our margins stable. Mike Murray : And Stephen, we\u2019ve been focusing a long time on driving a higher level of absorption on the community basis. And that allows us to control labor, and it makes the entire process of building house more efficient. And I think we\u2019re wreaking some of the benefits of that. Stephen Kim : Well, that\u2019s really encouraging. My next question relates to deleveraging in the fate of very strong demand. I mean, we\u2019ve seen your net debt to cap already now well below, what I would consider historical norms, and it seems to be on track to trend lower this year, giving a strong cash flow. I was wondering if you could talk to us about how you think about what the right level and what trajectory is appropriate for your leverage at this time, as we\u2019re seeing some recent demand indicators inflecting upwards? Bill Wheat : Stephen, we look at our balance sheet, our capital structure, and our guidance for the year and where we\u2019re guiding the Company to be. To the extent that we\u2019re able to still grow at a solid pace and consistent double-digit pace over the course of a year, and we\u2019re able to invest sufficiently to support that growth in 2017 and beyond and maintain a sufficient land pipeline, to the extent we're able to support that level of growth and still generate positive cash flow. From our standpoint, we don't have an ideal leverage level. We will take that cash flow and then do what we feel like is best in the interest of our overall Company, and our shareholders for the long term. And so an element of that that we\u2019ve prioritized this year is to continue to de-lever. We expect to generate $300 million to 500 million of cash flow, while still supporting our growth. And we\u2019re going to use $350 million of that to pay down debt, while continuing to reinvest in the business and continue to pay strong dividend to our shareholders, which we've increased and expect to pay about $150 million in dividends this year. So, it\u2019s really not an ideal -- not necessarily a target ideal leverage level, it's really just we're balancing that with supporting the growth we expect to generate the Company. Mike Murray : We're trying to create as much flexibility into the future as we possibly can. And so like Bill said, we don\u2019t a target on debt. But right now, we're generating enough cash to buy the land and lots that we need to support double digit growth. And speculating beyond, that\u2019s just not in our nature to do. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : I wanted to ask about, first the backlog conversion ratio. Very, very strong conversion ratio, I think, the strongest in five years, just wanted to dig into that a little bit. You mentioned you're obviously driving absorptions in communities. That may have played a part of that. But on the other hand, there's still, I think, pretty widespread concerns about labor. And so, how should we think about that? Are we getting back to normal in terms of just the ability to deliver homes? And so what's helping you overcome the labor concerns out there? David Auld : Nishu, we feel we were coming in the first quarter much better positioned, I mentioned before, on our homes and inventory, and where we are right now at December 31st with 24,500 homes in inventory. That is a great indicator of future closings, because we're getting the houses we want out of the ground, we're getting them where we want, and working them through to completion and then we're closing them. That's for us a much better predictor of closings volume in a given quarter perhaps than backlog conversion is. In terms of back to normal, I don't whatever is normal in this business, it seems like the conditions are always changing a bit year-to-year. And we're building a platform that allows us to respond to those market conditions, and look to position our communities in front of the market with the trades we need to build the houses when we want to get built. Nishu Sood : And another number, very-very strong, I think it\u2019s a record for your first quarter SG&A. I think it might be your first single-digit number you've ever reported, very strong performance. You mentioned that look, hey, don\u2019t expect the same level of improvement on the subsequent quarter, just wanted to dig into that a little bit. What drove the strong performance that might reverse in the subsequent quarters? Obviously, you've got the corporate relocation coming up that might be a factor. But why would it reverse after such a strong performance in the first quarter? Bill Wheat : Nishu, our costs that we had in the first quarter were normal. There wasn't anything unusual there in the cost at all. It's was really driven by the revenue line. We had guided to -- we exceeded the guidance that we provided for our backlog conversion in the first quarter, back to your first question. So our revenues were higher than that guidance range. And so then, therefore, that generated really strong leverage on our SG&A cost in the quarter. As we look forward to the rest of the year, our annual guidance for revenues are still in the 10% to 14% range, units $8 to $13 -- $10 to $14. And so, we do expect solid leverage on our SG&A, but we don\u2019t expect it to continue to be at 70 basis points. But we\u2019re very pleased with the start to the year. We\u2019re very pleased with our positioning, and our inventory, as well as in our SG&A expenses and our infrastructure and looking forward to continuing leverage that throughout the rest of the year. David Auld : Nishu, thank you for noticing that, that is something we worked very hard at. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : David, maybe this question is for you, or anybody can chime in. But I think everybody is trying to read the tealeaves on what impact, if any, higher rates might have on demand. And I think you certainly have a very balanced outlook there, and seems like there was no impact this quarter, certainly. I was curious if you were to go back in time in prior periods where we\u2019ve seen similar rate moves in 2013 to most recent instance. But certainly, there have been others. And if I look at your '13 results, you and everybody else pretty big deceleration in orders in that period and we generally have seen that in prior periods as well. So, it might be too early that to figure out what exactly is going to happen this go-around. But I was curious back then when you were out there in the field visiting your communities. What type of signs do you see that might have foretell that slowdown, and compare and contrast that maybe to what you\u2019re hearing from your people in the field today with that move we\u2019ve seen over the last eight weeks or so? Thank you. David Auld : Well, 2013, I don\u2019t know that it was necessarily the rate increase as the rapidity of the rate increase it kind of shocked the market. And you saw, I would say, a deceleration in traffic, less consumer confidence deal from our sales agents. We fought through it. I think we ended with a pretty good 2013. But it did have a significant impact. Right now, the over-optimism that seems to be up there in the market, just traveled through Florida, and I\u2019ll tell you, Florida feels like it is going to market as I\u2019ve seen the long time. Our sales agents were very excited. And we have inventory that right now we\u2019re in the best competitive position we\u2019ve ever been. As far as you great competition, price point competition model against model, it is as low as I have seen it for us. We\u2019re very bullish today on positioning inventory in front of what we think is going to be a pretty strong sales season. Mike Murray : Alan, I think we\u2019re seeing -- we see interest rates trend up gradually overtime today, in connection with job growth income growth and overall consumer confidence. I think those are very positives, because we\u2019ll see good household formations, we\u2019ll see good confidence by the consumer, and able to adjust to a gradual rate rise that seems to be telegraphed. I think in '13 what was different is that rates spiked-up very quickly for no reason, that was really tied to what people felt on the ground at the time. It was happened in a vacuum and it had very negative impact. Today, I don\u2019t think those things are happening in the vacuum. I think there's, as David mentioned, there's confidence, there's good traffic in the sales offices, there\u2019s very good confidence levels across our platform of 1,600 model homes. Our sales agents feel very good about the traffic they're seeing, and they feel really good about the indicators they're getting. Our inventory positioning is strong going into the spring. So we're very encouraged. Jessica Hansen : And as David already\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : It's Ivy, I was just going to ask you guys, sorry Alan for jumping in. One of the questions we get a lot from our clients, especially because of your strength in leadership and entry level, and recognizing that you were ahead of the curve and certainly pioneers in many markets that others are following suit. That the entry level customer is likely to be the most impacted on a rising rates. And frankly what we've heard is that it might even be more per se to the buyer who's stretching to maybe get to a move up. And so maybe sensitivity within the portfolio, maybe you could talk about the experience. So they just buy a little less house, a little less option. If in fact, you do see, if rate continue to rise and you do, and the future see some impact. Can you give us some of your perspective around the price sensitivity within the portfolio of different price points that might be helpful? David Auld : Well, what we are seeing is increasing demand. And I think, like Mike said, as long as the jobs are there nominal increases, over a period of time, people are going to adjust them. The position we're in is that we have a pretty broad product line in the Express and entry level Horton that we can flex down in price to meet a lower demand price, a lower price. Jessica Hansen : And as David mentioned earlier in the call, Ivy, that is why we believe our results are what they are and we've been focused on offering an affordable product. And we're going to continue chose specifically with our Express homes, and our new Freedom homes brands for the active adult. And we believe right now that's why we haven't seen any impact from the rate rise is that we are positioned where we want to be, and we'll continue to adjust as necessary to continue to offer an affordable product, regardless of the rate environment we're in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : The progress on absorptions, obviously impressive, I'm curious as you think about the growth path forward, the plans in terms of community count growth, the success you're having. Does it encourage you to be more aggressive in opening new communities over the next 12 months, just curious if your thinking on that has evolved? Mike Murray : Sure, Eric. Really, our outlook on community count is the same as it was last quarter. We expect community count from where we are today to still remain relatively flat over the next few quarters. At some point, we would expect it to increase. But right now, our community opening schedule would indicate that it\u2019s going to stay relatively flat. So sequentially, relatively flat, which would, it still indicate the year-over-year decrease. So, in this quarter, community count was down 5% but with the 20% absorption improvement, our sales are 15%; so, in the short to medium term, still relatively flat. David Auld : That's exactly right. Eric, I think also what we're seeing is the impact of some of the communities we\u2019re opening now are frankly more productive communities than some that are closing off. We've been focusing on a return based model for the past several years, and the fruit of that's coming through. We're seeing our return on homebuilding inventory jump up almost 300 basis points on a trailing 12 month basis over where it was a year ago. And our discipline around living within our means inventory wise and being very focused on the balance sheet has encouraged our field teams to be very selective in the community to bringing in line and whether deploying their capital as to whether it gets the most turn out of that capital. So, that's what we\u2019re seeing, I think, some good pickup in our absorption on a flag-by-flag basis. Eric Bosshard : The second question is in terms of the runway with Express, both from a competitive standpoint and a cost standpoint, and customer standpoint. Wondering how you view that? And if you view that any different if the runway and the opportunity is even greater than you had thought. Just wonder where we are in this cycle of the sustained success, or even accelerating the success with what you've done with Express? Bill Wheat : I will say the demand for the product and the returns from that that are able to generate very surprisingly. It was a much deeper and higher demand market than I thought it was going to be when we rolled it out. As far as sustainable, I think, that's a biggest part of pyramid, that's we're most of the buyers are. We are very well positioned in there. And we certainly feel like we can compete effectively and sustained, and grow. We\u2019re just rolling out in the west and just actually rolling out in Phoenix to kind of early in the stages in Denver, and maybe it's got a -- we feel like we've got a quite a bit of runway there. And we're equally excited about Freedom, which is our edge targeted edge designed product that we think is going to fit very nicely with Express, and offer some that does exist in market today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth Zener : So, I'm trying to understand, given the orders and to your units under construction converging, why you\u2019re thinking with that broad range. Because you are closing as a percent of units under construction in 1Q was kind of normal, so it didn\u2019t seem like that constrained. Orders have been following the seasonality over the last few years. Your under construction is up 14%. So how does that translate to 10% unit delivery for the midpoint for the year? I mean, what are we kind of missing there? Or is it just a natural conservatism on your part? Bill Wheat : Well, Ken, our guidance is not 10% on unit, its 8% to 13%. So there is a range there, so we could certainly be 10%, and still be in our guidance range. And as you well know, the entire year is driven really largely by the spring selling season. And so on the front edge of that and we certainly feel optimistic about it and we're positive about it, and we really feel like our positioning is very strong for that, but it hasn\u2019t happened. So, we will evaluate the spring as we get into it. We will certainly evaluate our guidance, and we\u2019ll update that as we thought we need to. Once we have the visibility into the spring, and it's still too early to do that at this point. Kenneth Zener : Understood. But we've had normal seasonal trends, so you don\u2019t need anything stellar to actually hit the high-end of your unit, is my, I guess, statement. [Multiple Speakers] yes, understood. Just for perspectives here, so not just certainly about the quarter but your lot costs increases in your stick and brick increases. You talked about what it was in 1Q. Could you just give us, just have a little broader trend, if you will, and hopefully have this available to you. What's the loss and separate stick and brick costs were in inflation wise for FY16 and FY15, just so we can kind of have that context? Jessica Hansen : Sure Ken. I'll talk about it very generally. And I am happy to follow up on the specific that we\u2019ve given on most of our calls over the last couple of years. In fiscal '15 is really where we started to see the sharpest increase in both, really primarily labor and to some extent materials. Therefore, a couple of quarters, we did experience a high single-digit percentage increase in our stick and brick cost per square foot, which was outpacing our revenues at that point in time. As we moved through the end of '15 and into '16, we were able to get that closer to call it a mid single-digit percentage. And our revenue started catching up with that stick and brick costs, which is where you saw our gross margin really start to stabilize and become very consistent for the last, call it, six to eight quarters now. And as we\u2019ve kicked off '17 and really the end of '16m we\u2019re in a low single-digit cost inflation environment. This is all stick and brick that I\u2019ve been talking about. In terms of lot costs, lot costs, if you go back to '15 and '16, pretty needed increases really into the back half of '16, which was when we started seeing, call it a mid to high single-digit increase in lot costs. And this quarter is one of the higher in terms of we were up 9%, as Bill mentioned earlier, for a lot cost increase on a per square footage basis. But we\u2019ve been able to offset the majority of that with price and kept that gross margin very, very consistent, at least from a lot level gross margin perspective. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bob Wetenhall : You guys, you\u2019re having a fantastic start to the year, congratulations. I wanted to ask you, how much of your outperformance and the strength in orders you attribute to, you guys taking share, relative to the broadest thing to the market. Are you guys doing something on the ground so you\u2019re picking up share? David Auld : That\u2019s always our goal. As we compete in every community and we continue to have affordable product out there, that\u2019s always our goal. If you look, really, when you look at share you have to look over a longer trend. And we certainly over the longer term have been pretty consistently gaining share, and that's certainly our goal going forward; market by market, community-by-community and then rolling-up to the overall companies to continue to gain share in marketplace, and looks like we\u2019re in really good position to do that. We\u2019re looking to position our communities our homes to be the best choice for every customer in every market that we\u2019re serving. So to the extent that helps us gain share, that\u2019s great to the extent it just helps us grow with the market, we\u2019re going to do that as well. Jessica Hamsen : And clearly, our product offering at the Express entry level affordable price point has driven an outsized increase in those efforts over the last couple of years. Mike Murray : Bob, everyone of our operators wants to be number one in their market. Whether they\u2019re closing 100 houses and 7,000 permit market or 500 houses and 600 permit markets, they want to win. And that\u2019s -- we instill that, we promote it. And our expectation is that they will win. With that said, we will gain shares. Bob Wetenhall : Well, it sounds like your execution is great. And my just follow-up question. You reiterated free cash flow guidance, M&A is the core strategy, you guys have a great track record of that. What's the pipeline like? And do you think it's a public or private type of M&A situation? Is there anything out there size wise that would be a game-changer that would be a good fit for the platform right now? Or do you think it's just going to be kind of selective sharp-shooter M&A? Great job, and thanks and good luck. Mike Murray : Thanks Bob. We continue to look at a lot of opportunities, and we evaluate them all against the track record we have. And so we have a very high bar for what makes sense for us to bring on-board. But we continue to look at every opportunity that's presented to us, give us a very serious look and try to learn and understand how it could be a good fit for the Company. And we will continue to do so. And it's been a very active time over the past few years, and I expect it will continue to be so. Bob Wetenhall : If you don't find that M&A opportunity, what do think you'd do with the cash, because you got a lot a cash on the balance sheet currently? Mike Murray : Well, over the last couple of years, we've generated a lot of cash and we\u2019ve consistently still found some acquisitions to allocate capital to work. So right now with pipeline that we see, our expectation is that we will still find some acquisitions that fit. So right now, we'll certainly think about if we don't find some acquisitions that fit. David Auld : There\u2019s a great big old vault underneath the new Horton building. And Don wants to be able to spit it out down there and play in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from J. P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone, and also obviously nice results on the orders, nice to see the rebound from the prior quarter. First question, I was hoping to dig into the Freedom homes rollout a little bit. You're still on track, it appears, and expecting to be in the third of your markets by fiscal '17 end. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of, and maybe remind us if we talked about this last quarter. But how does that Freedom brands product defer from your corporate average in terms of ASPs and sales pace? And given that it would appear that this is a market share gain opportunity. If this is something that is just getting revved up in this current year, is this something that you can, further perhaps take share in your given markets over the next two or three years? Jessica Hamsen : Sure Mike. We definitely agree with the latter part of your statement, in terms of this helping us to continue to capture additional share, as David mentioned earlier on the call. This is a product that we don't think really is out there today in terms of a lower price affordable active adults community, smaller community size, limited amenities, but good locations, kind of a lock and leave approach. So gated where we can and some pools and small club houses in markets like Florida. In terms of a price point, very early stages, so we\u2019ll adjust as we continue to roll it out. But we would currently anticipate it to run about 10% to 15% higher than a like Express product. And we do have plans, as you mentioned the beginning, to be in at least a third of our markets by the end of 2017. So not a huge driver of our 2017 results, probably more of a driver in 2018, but definitely something that's going to help us continue to consolidate share and rounds out our product offering for the one place we weren't really playing before. David Auld : Super large demographics favor that brand, and as interest rates pick-up, these buyers are less mortgage sensitive. So it's kind of a hit against a little higher rate as well. Michael Rehaut : And part of my, mind just to make sure I also get as part of that first question, the sales pace so that compares to the rest of the group. And then my second question is on SG&A, obviously continues to be a hallmark of the Company. It was interesting I was looking back at the past cycle. And in 2004, when you did a similar amount of homes close that you\u2019re guiding for this year, you actually also had an SG&A of about 9.1, it looks like in that year. And what struck to me was is that there are many builders today talking about maybe having a lower cost structure this cycle versus last, either through digital marketing, which is something that you guys talked about as well. But I was -- just the similar amount of closings and similar SG&A, would suggest the similar cost structure. And I was wondering if there is some pluses and minuses to your business model, from a cost standpoint, certainly what comes to mind is your three or four brands today, which might require a little bit more SG&A relative to your singular approach last cycle. But I was curious about some of the pluses and minuses on the SG&A front, because on a top down level, looks like the same cost structure. Jessica Hansen : Mike, I think, Bill will touch on the SG&A question, in terms of going back to your follow-ups freedom and absorption. Once again, very-very early stages for that brand, but we would likely anticipate it being faster than a typical Horton community, but probably not quite as fast tuning as an Express community. Bill Wheat : And then, Mike, compared to the historical, we've looked at those historical comparisons as well. And you\u2019re right, as far as where we were on SG&A as a percentage for the entire year in all four to similar closings was at 9.1 is a difference between then and now, as we were seeing significant price depreciation in our homes. In 2004, the data that I'm looking at it was a high single digits ASP increase then, which obviously creates a lot of SG&A leverage. And so today, we're achieving this with a much more modest ASP appreciation. And we're not really quite up to our peak volume yet, and with some lower on track for right now. And our expectations were we\u2019re guiding the 9%, we certainly feel very confident that we can hit the 9%. But if we continue to see the improvements and efficiencies in our business, we expect to push beyond that before we get fully to peak volumes again. You asked about costs and where there might be some changes. So, certainly in terms of efficiencies from technology, and you mentioned the marketing, certainly efficiencies there. Those are things that have been positives over this life cycle over the last decade that are certainly helping to contribute. On the cost side, frankly, the cost of regulations and running our business throughout our business in all respects of our business are significantly higher today at the local level and really all the way up through our business, which is something that we've had to absorb as well as everyone else in the industry, and well publicized. So I would say that's probably one of the more significant offsets to the other efficiency we\u2019re seeing. Jessica Hansen : The other big difference, Mike, between \u201804, \u201905, and \u201906 and our business model today is we have extremely pretty aggressive growth targets in place that we were actually adding headcount and building infrastructure out for. Today, we are growing. We have a stated target of double-digit revenue growth, and we're making sure we\u2019re incurring and adding SG&A to be able to handle that. But we don\u2019t have to add at the same rate today as we would have had to back then to go after that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : First question is, the orders in the west region seemed little bit lighter than we expected, and time to perform some of the other regions. Was this community count driven, or maybe with the rollout of Express in the California. What were the factors there? David Auld : John, in the west, as we\u2019ve talked about we have not been investing as heavily in the west. We\u2019ve been maintaining our position. And it's been relative to our other regions we\u2019ve been making larger investments in other regions. So I think it\u2019s a reflection of just a little bit lower growth expectation there in our west region, which does reflect itself in community counts. Bill Wheat : And we did get, because we don\u2019t have the number of communities there that we had in some of these other regions. The delays in getting a couple of significant communities online can impact quarter-over-quarter numbers. Michael Murray : And we\u2019re in the very early stages of Express roll-out there. So, it's not -- the west is not seeing as much benefit in absorption improvement and efficiencies. Yes that we have seen in other areas of the country. Bill Wheat : We are getting those communities open, and there is certainly a market after. John Lovallo : And then given some of Trump's rhetoric around bringing jobs back particularly in the auto industry. Is there any appetite on your part for expansion into the mid west? I mean, call it your Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio. Have you guys considered that? Michael Murray : We continually evaluate opportunities in our various markets, and we have looked at a few opportunities. When one make sense for us, we do think that those markets may have been a bit underserved in the past, and we\u2019ll evaluate those. But we do like our conscious positioning of where we focus most of our energies and most of our capital into out of the southern markets. And even where a lot of -- there has been a lot of auto manufacturers open production facilities across the south and southeast that have been good drivers for us, and sources of good business in the Carolinas and Alabama. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : The pick-up and absorption pace, I think, was one of the biggest things out of the quarter. I am wondering if you could give us, or if you have, the absorption pace improvement year-over-year for each of the brand, so Express, Horton and Emerald, just kind of get a sense of the relative mix? And do you have that number? David Auld : No, we don\u2019t buy brand. We\u2019ve got it here by region, but we don\u2019t have it here by brand in front of us, that\u2019s something we could look at and follow up with later on. But that\u2019s not something we have right here in front of us. Jack Micenko : And then your capture at mortgage had a nice improvement year-over-year. What was driving that? David Auld : I think, a lot it was driving the capture rate improvement, has been refocused by the mortgage company on improving their utilization that\u2019s shown up in a lot of their operating metrics, their operating margins improving as they\u2019re getting better overhead leverage as our volumes increase, and we\u2019re serving more of the Express home buyers, the first time home buyers. It's very helpful to our homebuilding operating divisions to have that customer managed at the mortgage qualification process into the backlogs, so that when home is ready. They are ready with the mortgage to close, and the service levels provided by our mortgage company to the home builder, are very high in that regard. I mean, we're still out there. The mortgage company is competing for the business, customer-by-customer in a very competitive mortgage market. But they're able to deliver a higher service level to that customer, because in the integration we have with the builder in a lot of cases. Jessica Hansen : And Jack to go back to your question, we were able to get our hands on the change in absorption by brand. And really, it was consistently strong across all three brands, a strong double-digit increase in absorption. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Dahl : Thanks for taking my questions and all the color so far, voice is a bit raspy. Wanted to ask about your owned option mix and you've been one of the few builders that's successfully pushed pretty meaningfully back towards option. And this quarter seems stabilized a bit recognize that it's not going to be so linear. But over time, you can continue to mix that higher. Curious to hear if there's anything reasonably you can speak to in terms of either incremental successes or challenges that you found and striking your option deals? Michael Murray : Mike, we're still not to our goal of 50-50 balance in our total portfolio of option and controls. Very happy with the relationships we've been able to expand upon with developers across the country. Key trade partners for us frankly in supplying the first raw material input to our business is land or lots. And we're very pleased with the increase of finished lots we've been able to tie up and partner with others to develop for us. That's probably driving a bit of our lot costs increase, as a percentage of revenue, or per square foot that we're seeing in our current deliveries. It\u2019s a reflection of our strategy to try to have more lots provided for the Company finish, rather than us self developing as much. And we\u2019re seeing a big benefit of that in our focus on our improved returns, and we're seeing that return to come up as a result of that. So there is no magic bullet to that. It\u2019s building relationships, partnering with the right people, market-by-market, having the experience with them, and the confidence to get projects on the ground and work through them together. Mike Dahl : And as part of the lower investment in the west, a function of just really still being more of a cash market and given your focus on shifting towards this balance, it's kind of an intentional mix away from the west? Bill Wheat : We're not decreasing our investment in the west. The balance is -- we like the west, we made a lot of money in the west. But we're just going to be disciplined, and we have underwriting guidelines for everything we do, whether it\u2019s in Texas or California, it's got to meet the same underwriting guidelines, which by definition is a capital limiter. But no, we\u2019re not reducing our investment in California. We're actually doing very well in the west. Very happy with our performance and the returns that we're driving. David Auld : And just continuing to work just like everywhere else to improve our returns on the west, there's more capital intensive areas. It's still an area we want to improve our returns in. Mike Dahl : One housekeeping then as a follow up, on the warranty and litigation this quarter. Is there any color you can provide, just as function of just as you've expanded in markets just normal course of business? Or is there anything regional or more one-time in nature? David Auld : Inherently, the warranty and litigation areas is a bit volatile, but lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we give the range we give for our margin guidance as that's just an element that you can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. And so the variable that we have this quarter is not outside our normal range, a little bit bigger than it has been recently, but nothing highly unusual at all. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Ryan on for Jade. Thanks for taking my question. It seems that other real-estate sectors are going through a period of price discovery as markets digest the economic outlook, but just after your rates. So can you say if you\u2019ve seen any adjustments in pricing, or bid-ask spreads or demand in the land markets that you are currently purchasing in? David Auld : We haven\u2019t seen any kind of an adjustment in land pricing at this point. Anecdotally, we\u2019re maybe getting another bite at a project that might have gotten buy once. So, some things maybe falling out, but that's just anecdotally -- it would be hard to put a trend of that or to see anything else happening on a harder quantitative basis at a global scale for us. Bill Wheat : Ryan, we closed some deals in our first quarter that were as good as any lot buy we made in the last four or five years. So, there are opportunities out there, and you just got to be out there looking for them. Unidentified Analyst : And then my second question is a bit more nuance. Have you seen any changes in the levels of completion in any of your markets from either single family rentals or multifamily apartments? Mike Murray : We've not seen -- it's an alternative of housing choice for a customer. But typically, those sources of housing stocks are great feeder for us into our business as people see changes in the rentals and the opportunity to have an ownership position, and lock-in their housing costs, very attractive alternative. So we have not seen a significant change in our markets relative to those at this point. But we do help a lot of people get into their first owned-home out of rental situation whether it was single family rental or more traditional multi-family rental. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today, and look forward to speaking with you again in April, as we share our second quarter results. And to the entire D, R. Horton team, an outstanding first quarter. You are truly the best of the best, and still fair enough of 2017. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

After the conclusion of the call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes current and historical supporting data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margins, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team produced solid second quarter results. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 18% to $354 million on a 17% revenue increase to $3.3 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin was stable at 10.9%. We experienced a 16% improvement in our absorption per community as home sales increased 14% compared to last year. These results reflect strength of our operational teams and diverse product offering across our broad national footprints, as well as a strong spring selling season. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenues and pre-tax profits, while generating annual positive operating cash flows and increasing returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved to 16%, up 220 basis points from 13.8% a year ago. We still expect to generate $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flows from operations in 2017. With 27,100 homes in inventory end of March and 227,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2017 and for future growth. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income for the second quarter increased 17% to $229 million or $0.60 per diluted share compared to $195 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 18% to $354 million in the second quarter versus $301 million a year ago and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 14% to $322 million compared to $282 million. Our backlog conversion rate for the second quarter was 94% above the high end of the range, we guided to on our first quarter call. As a result, our second quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $3.2 billion on 10,685 homes closed up from $2.7 billion on 9,262 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $295,600 up 2% compared to last year. This quarter entry level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 29% of homes closed and 22% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher end move up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 was 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is currently being offered in 10 markets across eight states. Customer response to affordable homes and communities offering a low maintenance lifestyle has been positive. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 17% from the prior year quarter to $4.2 billion. And homes sold increased 14% to 13,991 homes. Our average number of active selling communities was 2% lower than the prior year quarter but increased 2% sequentially from our first quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,400. And the cancellation rate for the second quarter was 20%, consistent with the prior year quarter. The value of our backlog increased 9% from a year ago to $4.4 billion with an average sales price per home of $303,400. And homes in backlog increased 7% to 14,618 homes. Mike? Mike Murray : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 19.8% consistent with our expectation in the first quarter. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix as well as a relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest cost. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues improved 20 basis points from the prior year quarter to 9.3% at the low end of our guidance range. For the six months ended March 31 homebuilding SG&A was 9.4%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the same period last year. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports current and future growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter increased to $31.5 million from $18.6 million in the prior year quarter, driven by growth in revenue and an improved operating margin. 96% of our mortgage companies loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation. Our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of our home buyers, up from 53% in the same quarter last year. FHA and DA loans accounted for 47% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with our mortgage company this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time home buyers represented 46% of the closings handled by our mortgage company consistent with the prior year quarter. David? David Auld : During the quarter, our total number of homes in inventory increased by 11%, as we prepared for higher closing volumes in the third and fourth quarters. We ended the second quarter with 27,100 homes in inventory, 13,200 of our total homes were unsold and 9,700 in various stages of construction and 3,500 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 10% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the remainder of the year. Our second quarter investments in lot, land and development totaled $814 million, of which $512 million were for finished lots and land and $302 million was for land development. During the first half of 2017 we invested $1.7 billion in lots, land and development compared to $1.1 billion in the first half of last year. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for each new community remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual net return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We plan to continue to invest in land and lots at a rate to support our expected growth in revenues. Mike? Mike Murray : At March 31, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 227,000 lots, of which, 118,000 or 52% are owned and 109,000 or 48% are controlled through option contracts. 77,000 of our total lots are finished, of which, 30,000 are owned and 47,000 are option. Our option lot position increased 42% from a year ago, in line with our focus on developing strong relationships with land developers across our national footprint. Our 227,000 total lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, and a sufficient lot supply to support future growth. Bill? Bill Wheat : At March 31st, our homebuilding liquidity included $948 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $900 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 560 basis points from a year ago to 28%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.8 billion. At March 31st, our shareholder's equity was $7.2 billion and book value per share was $19.23, up 14% from a year ago. Our balanced capital approach is centered on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our top cash flow priorities for fiscal 2017; include, continuing to consolidate market share by both investing in our homebuilding business and through strategic acquisitions; paying off $350 million of our senior notes of maturity in May; and providing consistent dividends which are expected to total $150 million this year. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity and continued earnings in cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined, opportunistic position to improve the long-term value of our company. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : We are updating our expectations for fiscal 2017 based on current housing market conditions and our financial performance to-date this year. As we noted in our press release this morning, we are updating our annual guidance as follows; we are increasing the range of our consolidated revenues to between $13.6 billion and $14 billion and are increasing the range of homes closed to 44,500 and 46,000 homes. We now expect homebuilding SG&A for the full year in a range of 8.8% to 9.1% of homebuilding revenues and are increasing our guidance for our financial services pre-tax operating margin to approximately 35%. We currently forecast an income tax rate of 35.5%. Also is outlined in our press release this morning, we are reaffirming our previously issued guidance for fiscal 2017 including a consolidated pre-tax profit margin of 11.2% to 11.5%. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of 2017 around 20% and annual diluted share count of approximately 380 million shares and $300 million to $500 million of positive cash flow from operations for fiscal 2017. Specifically for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we expect our numbers of homes closed will approximate beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 81% to 84%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be around 20% and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in the range of 8.6%, 8.8% of homebuilding revenues. David? David Auld : In closing, our second quarter growth in sales, closings and profits, is the result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry leading market share. We remain focused on growing both our revenues and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D. R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land positions and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We'd like to thank the entire D. R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we look forward to continuing to grow and improve our operations together. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : My first question, if I could just thinking about the pricing environment and costs. You raised the revenue guidance, held the gross margin guidance and we've heard from some other builders lately that pricing power seems to be re-emerging especially at the entry level, but at the same time there is obviously some uncertainty on the cost side, lumbers probably the biggest unknown just given the potential tariffs coming down the pike here. So I'm curious as you look at the full year gross margin and I guess just a little bit longer term, how you're thinking about those two offsetting factors and I guess just as a company as a whole, if you could just give a little bit of insight into how you purchase lumber and if you're doing anything differently to potentially since rising costs. Thank you. Mike Murray : Good morning, Alan. This is Mike. Thank you for the question. We're seeing some pricing power in the communities where we have achieved the absorption pace, where going to rode [ph] these communities too and so that's been very helpful in maintaining our gross margin. At the same time, with our cost structure going forward we're seeing an efficient building process yield in savings in our vertical construction cost and so we've been able to offset some of the lot cost increases we've been seeing some through to protect the margins. Looking forward with regard to our cost structure, our guys are working very hard every day, we're working very hard with our national supplier partners to protect that cost structure. I can't say we're doing anything radically different on buying lumber it's something we look at market-by-market looking at the commodity market and trying to lock-in pricing when we feel it's a good time again market-by-market in lumber. David Auld : And I'll just add that the supply-demand equation is, I think allowing us also lookouts we've seen that vary commodity-by-commodity. Land goes up price of house goes up, it ultimately comes down to positioning and efficiency and we get up every day working on those two things. Mike Murray : We do feel very confident about forward margin guidance and it still remained consistent as it has for the past few years. Alan Ratner : Got it. I appreciate that and on the cost side, I might have missed it. But do you have, however you look at it price per square foot, what your material and labor costs are on a year-over-year and just curious within the lumber component specifically, have you already seen that inflation hit your P&L or what the price increases is that going to be more on a go forward basis. Jessica Hansen : So Alan, this is Jessica. Year-over-year we saw revenue per square foot up 3% and our stick and brick costs were only were up 1%, what was offsetting that we do continue to see slightly higher land prices falling through our P&L on a per square foot basis and sequentially our revenues per square foot in our stick and brick was really right in line, they were both just very low single-digit percentage. In terms of lumber specifically we haven't seen any noticeable impact from lumber. Generally, when I talk to our purchasing teams, they say whatever that market price is doing or generally taking some lesser price increase when we're out there locking in our prices for our backlog and our homes under construction. Alan Ratner : Very helpful, thanks again. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : I wanted to ask about community count. I know we've talked about it being flat to little bit down for the balance of the year, when do you guys think that's likely to inflect and begin to track up as you look forward. Bill Wheat : Carl, this is Bill again. We've talked about it, we have visibility to exactly where the community count is pretty good for our quarter too but beyond that it gets a little murky just given the timing of when communities roll off. So as we look the next couple of quarters, we continue to believe we're going to stay relatively stable plus or minus flat within couple of percentage points. But we do believe that over the long-term as we get into '18 and beyond as we continue to expect to grow at a 10% to 15% pace on the top line that will require some community count growth and so as we make those investments to prepare for that growth, we would expect, so we get into '18 for our community counts to start to rise at a modest pace. We still expect to continue to improve our absorptions and are very focused community-by-community on executing as well as we can to continue to drive some of our growth through absorption improvement as well. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thanks Bill. And then, if I can ask about Freedom and the roll out. When we had gone and looked at the product I'm curious about whether or not you're concerned about cannibalization of the Express product. We talked about Express one of the reasons it's been successful is because you saw a larger percentage of customers in that product who were effectively move down buyers and so, I think the thinking is, well if you're opening Freedom near Express you may see some level of cannibalizations, so how do you think about and balance that and has there been any impact to Express absorptions because of nearby Freedom product? David Auld : Carl, this is David. We haven't seen any negative impact to Express. The concept of Freedom is to capture an expand the offering to include the people that just don't want to live next door to a two-storey with bunch of kids and those buyers are out there. We're trying to set these communities up as kind of lock and leave opportunity something that they don't have to be there every day to maintain and that was a buyer segment that to be honest with you, we were not actively pursuing at the level, we are now but we think it's a huge opportunity for the company and little more difficult to roll out in Express because it a specific type of community that we're launching Freedom, you can't just go build it on a lot. From my perception and what I'm hearing from our people Freedom is not going to cannibalized it's going to augment and I think support Express. Carl Reichardt : Thanks so much guys. I'm sorry, go ahead. Bill Wheat : Just as we look it's very early when we look at average price points on Freedom versus Express today, they're running about 10% to 15% higher, so there is a little bit of extra cost for those home buyers, so they're still affordable but certainly a step above Express and there is an element of HO8B to cover the maintenance and those [indiscernible] for the community that are not in Express as well, so little bit of differentiation from an economic standpoint. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East : Your guidance for revenue for the full year suggest you're slowing down in the second half and your backlog today, your growth in your backlog today is whole lot different than your growth in the fourth quarter of last year, so I'm trying to understand is it just conservatism or you're all seeing something out there that will take longer to deliver on the homes, what's driving that reduced growth rate in the second half? Bill Wheat : Well Stephen, you know got off to a really good start, to start of the year and the spring helps drive where we're going to be for the end of the year, we're raising our guidance for the year to a higher annual growth rate and as we get a little bit closer, if we see that we need to raise a bit more, we certainly will do that, but I wouldn't try to imply necessarily anything as far as a moderating growth rate at all, we're right in line, right in the range of what we've been investing for and planning for the year. Stephen East : Okay, all right appreciate that. And then, you talked about your capital allocation which I appreciate, you talked about M&A sort of couple part question here. One you talked about M&A, there are a lot of non-traditional buyers out there right now and I'm wondering, is it disrupting the market. You don't have the strategic buyers we're not seeing be that active and just wondering why the strategic buyers aren't as active or the non-traditional guys pushing pricing too far etc. and just how you all are thinking about it and then, no conversation of share repurchase in your capital allocation and while I'm not a huge repo guy. When I look at the impact, it can have on your returns, your ROEs that can make a big difference, so just your thoughts there. Mike Murray : Stephen this is Mike on the M&A question, we're continuing to be very active and looking at a lot of opportunities and the most important things for us are finding a good homebuilder, a good operation that fits with us culturally and lot-wise and equally is important is a reasonable seller and reasonable seller expectations and there has been a little bit of dislocation in that, but I would say that seems to have died down a bit and we might see the bit outspread and there little bit coming, going forward. Bill Wheat : Stephen, this is [technical difficulty]. I'll tag onto to the rest of the question and in terms of our overall allocations acquisitions are part of that, but we're going to remain disciplined and so we're going to, we certainly have the room to make large investment there, if we find the right deal that fits out return strategy. In terms of share repurchase, we have an outstanding authorization from our board of $100 million which we have not used as of yet and when we talk about our top priorities our most significant priorities for this year, we'd laid those out but that is something and we've talked about this previously that as we look further and as we generate cash flow for our third consecutive year over the longer term, we would expect there to be some level of share repurchase in our overall allocation, but as of yet we have not purchased any shares back. Stephen East : All right, fair enough. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : So this focus on absorption growth versus raw community count growth obviously been, you've been successful with that, this trend I guess dates back probably about two years or so. Current pace puts you at about 46,000, 47,000 orders for fiscal 2017. How much upside is there as you think about getting all over communities to their optimal absorption rate? I mean does that take us to 55,000, 60,000 on the current footprint and I understand you mentioned community counts might begin to rise again in 2018, just trying to think about how much upside there is left on this absorption push? Mike Murray : Nishu, we're just focused every day, every community getting incrementally little bit better. If you'd asked us three years ago if we'd be exactly where we're today I'm not sure what our answer would have because we're just trying to get better every day and what I'd tell you is that, our operators through the field and our division Presidents who are out there working hard every day, they're finding ways to get better every day and so we do believe there is continued upside, there is continued opportunities to continue to get better, we got certain markets, that so they can significantly better. We've got others that maybe getting closer to that potential, we're going to keep trying to work to improve it and we do believe that, in this year and into next year we will continue to find ways to improve our absorptions. Exactly what that full potential is, what the feeling is, I'm not sure there is ever a feeling. We're just going keep working to get better. David Auld : Nishu, it's never going to be good enough with our Chair, [ph] an active shareholder we have here, so we're just going to keep rolling. Nishu Sood : Got it. Okay, so sounds like still some runway left there. The southwest division had some pretty good looking metrics this quarter in terms of the orders and the pricing etc. Can you dig down into that obviously the closings were up nicely as well? Can you just dig down into that and walk us through the drivers of that please? David Auld : Go ahead, Mike. Mike Murray : Thank you for noticing. The southwest market is, had been a little bit of smaller area for us and we have been repositioning that group and making some investments in opportunities in Phoenix primarily and that team has done a great job of taking advantage of those opportunities in a market that's kind of been rebounding, bit. So very happy with the positioning that our team is done and their execution against that position and so that's really simply is what it is right there. David Auld : Nishu, we spend a lot of time talking about people, people. We've got an operational focus and a leader in that division today that we can support with capital and she's doing a tremendous job of turning that into growth and profitability, so kudos for her. Nishu Sood : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zener : I'm thinking Toy Story, infinity and beyond for your order pay. David Auld : Absolutely, Ken. Ken Zener : Yes, so looking at from operational metrics your orders were basically seasonal in 2Q that's quarter-over-quarter pace. You guys did very well in 1Q, so it's good you maintained that. But when I think about your guidance which is related to closing, I think about comms [ph] that are totally about which includes all your specs, so you used under construction. Your guidance went from I think 8% to 13%, it's like 10% to 14% for year-over-year now and little bit. But your units under construction was 14% growth in 1Q, now we're down to 10%. Can you talk about the decisions that are being made to have that lower growth, was it warmer weather that it enabled you to put more units in the ground and you're really targeting 10% because the delta shows that you're decelerating your units under construction, which obviously build up in the year closing. So can you kind of talk about that actual capital allocation if we use units under construction, year-over-year as the indicator for your forward, best speedometer. Bill Wheat : Sure, Ken. We've talked quite a bit about the fact that we were starting this year much stronger in position back on October 1 and then January 1 with our units under construction to prepare ourselves for the spring and so we had a stronger a year-over-year comparison in those first couple of quarters, I wouldn't say that we're decelerating at all and order versus our expectations there, we just simply got an earlier start and so now we're into a good mode of just replacing homes and maintaining on that level, that we believe will support the growth that we're expecting and position to start to position ourselves then for next year as well, so wouldn't read too much into just this quarter and positioning on a year-over-year, we're in a good position with our homes under construction. Ken Zener : Go ahead, David. David Auld : We are focused on a community-by-community process and market shifts and starts and plans, targeted closings. We're trying to disciplined, we're trying to be smart and we're trying to maximize every flags, so again we set annual targets, we operate quarter-to-quarter and we adjust, but don't read anything negative into that number. Bill Wheat : As you look at, as our community counts do start to get back to close to flat year-over-year and then rising into 17, obviously there is some homes that go along with those flags as well, that I would expect to be coming into the picture as well. Ken Zener : I wasn't set up as a derogatory comment, it's just that I think people misunderstand that number or don't apply it enough. As you start moving into right from 2Q, to 3Q, to 4Q. 4Q is actually just multiply it every times two and it's usually your forward volumes. So I'm just trying to think about not only the execution that you're doing this year but how you're setting up conceptually 18 right from your capital allocation, as we think about that and it seems as though. Labor is not an issue here, closing is a percent of units under construction is exactly what it was last year, you obviously labor is not an issue for you so, just determining how many units you are going to have in for spec so. David Auld : We're very focused on maintaining and I think, to be honest with you. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bob Wetenhall : A surprise, another great quarter to report just wanted to understand your gross margin target a little bit better. It looks like you're increasing your financial services operating margin by a pretty healthy amount. But at the same time, you're reiterating your full year gross margin guidance. And I just want to understand kind of what the offset was. It sounds like cost pressures are actually rather benign, can you help us think through that a little bit? Mike Murray : Sure, Bob. This is Mike. What we have is financial services are not a component of our gross margin, that's down in our other area, operating margin. It's part of operating margin overall, but we're seeing gross margin to be consistent with where it's been. Financial services is improving a bit and will probably get some more SG&A leverage in the second half of the year. Bob Wetenhall : Right. So with that - so sorry, I misspoke, I meant to say you reiterated your full year operating margin for the company of 11.2 to 11.5. There seems like you got a very positive trend there on the financial services side with the consistent gross margin. So you're also getting the SG&A leverage so I'm just trying to understand, at some point does operating margin inflect higher just because of what's going on? Jessica Hansen : It will depend on what happens with gross margin in the back half of the year, but if you look at it at the first six months of the year, we're only running 19.8% so our margin is a little loose [technical difficulty] 20%, [technical difficulty] talk a lot about 19% to 21% as the broader range, so as if, we move into Q3 and Q4 and we do see that margin pick up over 20% that could allow us to have some upside or at least hit the high end of our operating margin guidance, but because we're only running 19.8% for the first six months of the year, we don't feel like it makes sense to move that operating margin range up from where it is today. Bob Wetenhall : That makes perfect sense. Thank you. And that's very helpful. And also too, just a follow-up question if I may. What should we expect about the conversion rate going forward, the backlog? Do you think it will just be consistent with last year or do you expect any change to the pace? Jessica Hansen : We're focused on improving that on a year-over-year, so we're projecting a lower conversion rate sequentially but that's typical seasonality for us, but in terms of year-over-year we would hope to see some improvement although, let's see, yes we guided to 81% to 84% and that compares to last year's third quarter conversion rate of 78%. Bob Wetenhall : Very impressive. David Auld : Just trying to get better every day, Bob. Bob Wetenhall : Sounds good, good progress. Congrats on a great quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : I wanted to ask a question, if I could about the difference in the way you approach implementing price increases in communities which are perhaps lower price point, maybe more volume oriented versus more of your semi-customer or move up product. In general, we're hearing that there is strength across the board but probably more concentrated at the lower end, lower price points and I was curious if you could give us a sense for, if your strategy or the pace of implementation of price increases varies or is different when the strength you see is more in those lower price communities. David Auld : Stephen, we try to be consistent in our operation and absorption in these communities. So based upon the season and timing within the year, but the best practice we found is small, incremental based on number of units that are being sold, so if it's a 300-lot community and we want to sell 10 a month, then we would have a nominal increase every 10 houses, so if there is a consistency to the pricing, there is a set urgency to get people off fence, and they buy now or they pay little more next month. So and that's proven to be very effective, it's not only creates urgency but it improves margin. Stephen Kim : Got it, that's helpful. Thanks for that. And then the second question I had to relates to kind of more general question, I think one of the things that we're seeing that's really fascinating about the industry and the stocks right now is, this sort of blend between things that are early cycle and later cycle, the valuations that we're seeing in the group, level of margins, the labor constraints you're running into and first rate of land spend as a percentage of revenue those are all things to more characteristic of later cycle and yet, we - I should say the not the multiple the evaluations are actually more early cycle. But we're also seeing that growing share at the entry level and the overall level at housings are to very cycles. So you have some aspects to the market that are kind of early cyclish [ph] and then you have some aspects it seems like they're more later cyclish [ph]. And I'm curious as to, as you look it where we are right now and you try to assess your strategy over the course of the next few years let's say, where do you think we are in the housing cycle and which of these various metrics or things to look at, do you think are the best gage for determining where we are and what the right approach for your company should be from a cyclical perspective. David Auld : We operate sub-division-by-sub-division and drive growth within submarkets and I can tell you we have submarkets are very early cycle and then we have others where they feel more mature. It doesn't get a sense that it's an actuary or something like there will be some disruptions and things may change. But right now in the markets that are producing at the top for us, there is more demand and less options or inventory out there than any forward that I have been in this business, so and I think you get too focused, I think sometimes we can get too focused on trying to judge a cycle and miss tremendous opportunity. So we're adjusting quarter-to-quarter and supporting the divisions that are improving returns. Mike? Mike Murray : Stephen, I think you touched on it not just geography as David mentioned and individual submarkets, but within markets different customer segments have been coming into the housing equation at different times. I think coming out of the last downturn we saw more of the move up buyers pent up demand being satisfied in that rush and now I think we're seeing more the entry level first-time buyers coming into the marketplace now that there is some supply out there, that is attainable for those folks. So we're - as David said community-by-community being responsive of what we see in the market in front of us and rather than looking at broad trends, we're focusing at a very micro level with our capital. David Auld : So we made a decision to push into the entry level opportunities that we see out in California and I can tell you that's certainly isn't late cycle because those opportunities haven't existed for the buyers out there and Don Horton traveled the west region over the last 30 days and you know, he's not an exuberant type guy, but he came back feeling better about what he saw in the west and specifically the opportunities in California and I have seen him in a long, long time. And I traveled Texas, Louisiana and Arizona in the last couple of months and I can tell you, I think I said two or three years ago Dallas was the best housing market I've ever seen, still an incredibly strong market, but [indiscernible] strengthened Houston an opportunity and Houston that compressed oil industry, kind of put on hold. Austin is red hot. Phoenix is - we're opening a price point Phoenix didn't exist. So to say that, Phoenix is that some point in the cycle I tell you from affordable housing standpoint it is at the very front end of the cycle. So it's just market-by-market and where people want to live and where there is no houses, we found the ability to sell houses. Stephen Kim : Well for a company that doesn't focus on the cycle, you guys are certainly been doing a lot of things that looked pretty present [ph] from a cyclical perspective I have to say over the last several years. Just to put a fine point or to make sure I understood what you said, you don't manage to a cycle per se, but you don't mean to suggest that when we go into the next down cycle or downturn in the economy that you think that the markets across the country will some markets will be completely immune to that, do you - the market is going to [indiscernible]. Right? David Auld : No, I was around in '08, '09, '10 we're not in [indiscernible] market. Mike Murray : Not at all, but the only way to respond you can't respond at a global level effectively, you still have to respond on the ground in a sub-division what's the right decision, day-to-day and operating that community and what's going on around it and that's the way our operations set up, as to what our all of our operations field are focused on every single day. Bill Wheat : And over the backdrop for the past several years, the balance sheet strength we have garnered that's going to give us regular flexibility through wherever the next cycle holds for the next stages of the cycle to make those best decisions, community-by-community. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : The first question here is and I don't want to be the dead horse, but I just want to be clear because I do believe this is why the stock is under pressure today. If we look at the first half revenue growth, year-over-year it's about 18.8%. If we take the high end of your total revenue range of $14 billion that's going to imply 15% growth for the full year at 13.6%, it's about 12% growth. So it does appeal like there is a deceleration and the market is looking for any reason to say that growth is slowing. So what are you guys seeing, is this is really kind of just that you got up to a stronger start, you see any indications that demand is slackening, it orders trail off through the quarter or are things looking a lot better than market is actually giving you credit for today. Bill Wheat : Well John, I think one element here is, if we're looking at simply year-over-year trend one part of that component is the prior year numbers. We had a slow start last year honestly and we've talked about that, we were trying to play catch up all year long with our homes and inventory and getting communities open and we got lot of our growth last year in achieving our 10% to 15% of the growth in the second half of the year, we worked really hard to position ourselves to start this year a better position and so when we performed in Q1 and Q2 versus a slower Q1 and Q2 last year, we've seen a higher annual growth rate. The year is still right in line with what we've expected, it's not a deceleration of growth. It's really more of function of the comparison to the prior year on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We invest in this business on multi-year cycles, we plan our years out and we try to put ourselves and each of our communities in the best position possible to execute as well and give ourselves an opportunity to do better and we believe we were in good position this year to do it, we're feeling really good about the rest of the year, we're feeling really good of our ability to position ourselves to grow double-digit again in fiscal '18 and we certainly don't feel like we're decelerating here. It feels like we're in position to do exactly what we were planning to do. John Lovallo : Okay and that's really helpful and then if we think about just kind of traffic that's been coming through your communities, interest rates have bounced around a bit, I know last quarter you mentioned that you didn't see any real notable impact, but how is traffic, how are folks feeling in general, is there any continued chatter about interest rates that you guys are hearing? David Auld : Not a lot of chatter about interest rates, I can tell you the sales people in our company today feel as good about the market as they have ever. Traffic numbers are up. We're selling houses, we're well positioned against competition, where we have competition and it's just a good time to be in the business. John Lovallo : Okay, that's it. It's really helpful guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko from SIG. please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : Wanted to talk a bit more about Freedom, I know in the past you've talked about it being a growth opportunity next year, I think you said 10 markets in eight states today, is it possible for you size what that looks like a year from now four, five quarters from now and if it is growing and the community count numbers are still flattish, what do Freedom communities displace or will that be the growth in community count. David Auld : This is David, I think Freedom will be growth within our community count. We're certainly not looking to displace any of our other brands, it is kind of unique product and offering, it's not going rollout at the same speed that Express did. So but yes I think in '18, '19 it will be a big part of the growth story. Jack Micenko : Okay, great and then. On the financial service margin, what is driving it higher, is that just more volume or are you doing more FH VA[ph] that's driving the gain on sale profitability higher? What's behind the changing guidance on the financial service side? Jessica Hansen : We're seeing better land sale executions, so we're seeing higher gains on sale. We're also continuing to see a higher average loan amount particularly in this quarter. So that coupled with just this doesn't affect the operating margin but the revenue growth that we saw and our increase capture rate again, our financial services operations has done a great job of that capturing more of our home buyers or D.R Horton home buyers and that all helps us play out to drive better efficiencies, better G&A leverage to drive that higher operating margin. Jack Micenko : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Mike Dahl : David, wanted to follow-up on comment you made about California and D.R's tours a couple of questions ago and just to ask specifically, is the enthusiasm coming from the Express rollout or is it kind of across your brands and then specific to the rollout of Express, can you give us a little more color on how that's going and whether or not there is been any impact from things like the rains that you've seen in parts of California. David Auld : I would say the enthusiasm was the alignment of our people out there, with the opportunities in the market because he was not only in California looking at the Express program. While at, he was also along the coast looking at our infill operations and up in Seattle and Portland. So I mean it's just strong markets with aligned teams executing very well and what was California Express question? I'm sorry. Mike Dahl : Just if you could give us any update on how that rollout's going and whether or not it's been any impact from the rain? David Auld : Have not seen a big impact on the rain because it's everything in California it takes a lot longer, we have a significant number of projects identified and or controlled and we're launching like the impact that we're going to see probably going to be in the 2018, but just the opportunity and the positioning that we've been able to accomplish pretty exciting for us. Mike Dahl : Got it. David Auld : Have not seen lot of impact on the rains. Mike Dahl : Thanks. My second question is going back to actually I think the first question around lumber and I appreciate that you guys have the purchasing power to negotiate much better deals than some other across the industry, but just want to make sure we understand just mechanically the right way to think about it between how you contract out on lumber and then the cost allocation process that takes place as you incur potentially higher cost and then obviously your build cycle. So could you extend this most recent leg higher in lumber sticks, is that something that will impact the P&L in the second half or is it more likely to be something where you'd have it impacting fiscal '18. Mike Murray : Mike, so we would allocate the cost to the individual houses that we're buying the lumber for and we're looking out lumber pricing, it varies on the lot 30, 60, 90 days and some adjustments so that, so the buying, protecting our backlog and our plan spec starts in the near term. So as any lumber cost may come through in our purchasing production they would show up in a house closing four to six months after that lumber was dropped on the lot, or two to six months after that lumber was dropped on the lot and so you would see that particular cost line potentially having some pressure, but I would tell you that we would expect to see some of those things offset by other decreases and other material costs that we're seeing as well as continued greater labor efficiencies that we're getting with our production processes in our neighbourhoods, more with the Express and some of that Express concepts going into our other product lines. Mike Dahl : Got it and are there any things that you can point out specifically as far as the areas where you're seeing the decreases for the actual sticks and bricks cost? Mike Murray : Nothing point out specifically, it's just that we've been working really hard with lot of our national trade partners to focus on our purchasing power and some of the mutual benefits we can both have in expanding their market share in a given market. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : First question, just wanted to circle back to community count and it looks like actually it was a couple questions earlier about, maybe community count flat to slightly down and you kind of I think earlier Bill talked about community count being stable for the year, but it seems like community count was actually up sequentially 3% during the quarter and you also have, I think as you've alluded to earlier, you have a continued growth now in lock count for a few quarters up solid double digits and excuse me that I didn't, I forgot the type in the total number for this quarter, but believe you're still at a healthy double-digit pace now for a few quarters. So why wanted lock count maybe continue to drift up sequentially for the rest of year, similar to the second quarter rate. Jessica Hansen : Are you asking, if our lock counts is going to continue to drift up? Michael Rehaut : No, I'm sorry the community count, excuse me. Jessica Hansen : Sequentially our community count on average was up 2%, so it was the first time we've seen a slight tick up in that community count and we do have the lot for that to happen but as Bill mentioned earlier the timing of when communities roll off and when new ones roll on, it's pretty flexible and it's highly dependent on the sales absorptions we're seeing in our currently open communities and then also just our ability to bring new communities online because there is a lot of moving part. So we could see that continue to go up, but we don't expect it to go drastically up, any changes in our community count both sequentially and year-over-year we would expect to be in the low single-digit range. Michael Rehaut : Okay, fair enough. Also on the gross margin front, obviously still well within your guidance range, but essentially what you've had now couple of quarters a touch below 20%, that was proceeded by the back half to '16 a little bit above 20%, so just curious if there is anything mixed driven so far in the first half of this year that you know resulted in it being a little touch below, it seems like your cost inflation is still very reasonable and not too much of a driver, if I'm interpreting those numbers correctly. So just curiously, if it was little bit more mix driven or you know obviously the warranties sometimes play a role. Bill Wheat : Mike, this is Bill. We really think, incredible stability actually in our gross margin for quite some time now, at a core level it's been very tight within 20, 30 basis points from quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter and that's why we guide around 20 and we can see some quarterly volatility due to some of those other factors that you mentioned, in general our interest costs have been ticking slightly lower as a percentage of our cost and so that's been a slight help to our margin over the last eight quarters or so. We see more volatility in terms of our warranty line there and in recent quarters we've seen a little bit more of a negative impact from that, not too significant but a little bit more of a negative impact there in the last couple of quarters, which is one factor why we've been slightly below 20%, but overall we would characterize our margins as very stable, we're seeing actually less volatility from all of those factors than we've seen over the longer term history in our company and as long we're continuing to guide to around 20%, but you'll see some movement either above 20% and or below 20% from quarter-to-quarter. Jessica Hansen : And Mike, we'll post after the call, our supplementary data that has home sales growth margin slide in it that shows the specific basis point impacts either up and down to what we kind of call our core growth margin, some of those items that Bill and you've already touched on, you can see the specifics after the call. Our next question comes from the line of Will Randall with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Will Randall : On Express and Freedom, the two things we noticed touring those brands in our recent field trip is your covering cost out of those homes, You're not using troughs [ph] for example and that Freedom buyers specifically buying to live near their adult children in for example in Express community. So can you discuss how much cost your carved out of Express and Freedom relative to your pure set on a dollar or a percentage base and secondly, what quantifiable benefits are you seeing from active adults buyers buying Freedom homes and communities near their children, who possibly bought a Horton home? Bill Wheat : Well your question on the costs, was that related to troughs [ph], we didn't quite hear you there. Will Randall : Sorry, so yes. So you've carved out cost on troughs [ph] and another places been a home, so that was my first one, can you quantify the benefits and second, what first derivate benefits are you seeing from active adults by near their children and co-located communities because we heard a few of your sales people say that on your recent tour. David Auld : That's part of our overall analysis of Freedom, is that we're giving adult children and the parents an opportunity and an affordable opportunity to live near their children and grandchildren. I mean we just feel like that's a major factor and people relocating and I've lived in Florida for 25 years, saw it every day where somebody was moving down. A job had brought the family the children and grandchildren down and then the parents were coming on trying to find something to buy, where they would have the home close to their grandchildren. Just think that's a big driver in the market and as far as the overall cost and the design and what I mean that's a market-to-market determination. What we try to do with the Freedom product is drive as much as efficiency and labor savings as we possibly could. And so everything we're doing today is to drive better value to the customer and try to take labor out of houses where we can because that's going to be, that has been and continuously the constraint on a market right now. There is not a builder out there that could sell more houses, if they couldn't build. Will Randall : And I guess as a follow-up realizing your exposure to California smaller than those to your public peers, there have been concerns regarding the ever senseless State of California mandating what type of labor be choose via AB199 and in number of markets which can add thousands of dollars of cost to house and also a mandate to reduce emissions by 20% in 2017, which can add another $5,000 to $10,000 per house. We've heard AB199 as a move point but the emission cost is real, can you comment on both the AB199, you may have as well as the emissions productions, cost for you. Mike Murray : Well, we compete market-by-market and we're going to be competitive in every market we're in as David said looking to provide the value on the ground, that we're and it's great thing about the country, we have different parts and act different roles that meet with their population wants to see happen, so we have an exposure to California, maybe it is a little smaller percentage wise than some other of our peers, but we do like our positions in California and the way we're positioned to take advantage of some affordable value plays we have there. Operator : We have time for one last person in queue. Our last person is Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Just wondering if you could just maybe offer a little bit of color on the month-to-month trends in order growth activity, just how that progressed January through March and any comments you might be able to offer on how April is feeling right now? Bill Wheat : Buck through the spring, we really seem to have solid good consistent demand out there, really good supply-demand dynamics, very little supply and so a really just a good solid, stable, consistent spring and really thus far in April we're seeing the same kind of conditions, pretty healthy good strong market out there. Buck Horne : Sounds good and on the just looking at your option lot position, since that's been growing so rapidly and I know that's a determined strategy, so what opportunities are still out there to keep growing the number of lots you're controlling through option, how do you see that longer term mix of owned versus option land going and does that impact your margins at longer terms. David Auld : Historically we like 50-50 balance as far as the [indiscernible] option lot contract is typically they extend over a period of time and your margin is on the front end of the community, maybe a little less but if pricing power continues within the market depending on times and the cycle, you can actually end up on the back half of those deals except market price lots and very strong margin. Mike Murray : About one more comment I'd make on the, that lot positioning and impact on margins, we're really focused on in underwriting our communities is our return that we get community-by-community and optional lot positions can provide a very efficient, very high returning community to move forward, with that. So it's not just the margin that's one component of the returns that we're looking at it a community, in our underwritings but returns are much more important to us today and generating cash flow. Buck Horne : Sounds good, thanks. Good quarter guys. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to over to management for closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Doug and we appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in July. Again a special thanks to the D.R. Horton team. Outstanding quarter, you continue quarter after quarter to outperform the industry and we certainly appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team is producing strong results in 2017. In the third quarter, our consolidated pre-tax income increased 17% to $444 million on $3.8 billion of revenue. Our pre-tax profit margin was 11.8%, and the value of our homes sold increased 13%. For the nine months ended June, our consolidated pre-tax income increased 21% to $1.1 billion on an 18% increase in revenue to $9.9 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the nine-month period improved 30 basis points to 11.2%. These results put us on strong \u2013 put us on track to deliver our guidance on all metrics for the full-year of 2017, and reflect the strength of our operational teams and diverse product offerings across our broad national footprint. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits, while generating annual positive operating cash flows, and increasing our returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 16.3%, an improvement of 200 basis points from 14.3% a year ago. With 27,600 homes in inventory end of June and 252,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter and further growth in 2018. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Net income for the third quarter increased 16% to $289 million or $0.76 per diluted share, compared to $250 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 17% to $444 million versus $379 million a year ago. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 19% to $415 million compared to $348 million. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 85%. As a result, our third quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $3.7 billion on 12,497 homes closed, up from $3.1 billion on 10,739 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $293,100, up 1% compared to last year. This quarter, entry-level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 33% of homes closed and 25% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 6% of homes closed, and 15% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 15 markets across 12 states, and customer response to the affordable homes in communities offering a low maintenance lifestyle has been positive. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter to $3.9 billion and homes sold increased 11% to 13,040 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter, and 2% sequentially, from our second quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $296,900, and the 21% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the prior year. The value of our backlog increased 6% from a year ago to $4.6 billion with an average sales price per home of $306,400. And homes in backlog increased 3% to 15,161 homes. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 19.8% consistent with our expectations in the first half of the year. Our gross margin decreased 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter due to higher litigation costs. In the current housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20% with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21% due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues improved 50 basis points from the prior year quarter to 8.4% due to better leverage of our fixed overhead costs from increased revenues. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $29.3 million, compared to $30.2 million in the prior year quarter. 95% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 55% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719, and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 46% in the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We ended the third quarter with 27,600 homes in inventory, 12,800 of our total homes were unsold with 9,200 in various stages of construction and 3,600 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 9% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2018. Our investment in lots, land and development during the third quarter totaled $1.1 billion, of which, $740 million was for finished lots and land, and $360 million was for land development. During the nine months ended June, we invested $2.8 billion in lots, land and development, compared to $2 billion in the same period of last year. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We plan to continue to invest in land and lots at a rate to support our expected growth. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: This quarter, we achieved our previously-stated goal of a 50% owned, 50% optioned land and lot pipeline. At June 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 252,000 lots, of which, 125,000 are owned and 127,000 are controlled through option contracts. 83,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 50,000 are optioned. We have increased our optioned lot position 41% from a year ago, and we plan to continue expanding our relationship with land developers across our national footprint to further increase the option portion of our lands lots (09:31). Our 252,000 total lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market, and sufficient lot supply to support our targeted growth. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: On June 29th, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire 75% of the currently outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly-traded residential real estate development company for $17.75 per share in cash or approximately $560 million of total cash consideration. The strategic relationship between D.R. Horton and Forestar will significantly grow Forestar into a large national residential land development company, selling lots to D.R. Horton and other homebuilders. Forestar will remain a public company with access to the capital markets to support its future growth. The proposed merger accelerates our strategy of expanding D.R. Horton's relationships with land developers and ultimately increasing the option portion of our land and lot position to enhance operational efficiency and returns. As a reminder, there is a slide deck with additional details about the transaction available on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.drhorton.com/for. We remain confident in the growth plan for Forestar as outlined in that presentation. Our interactions with the Forestar team have been very positive, and we are pleased with the progress we are making on the acquisition. The transaction is expected to close in our first fiscal quarter of 2018, subject to the approval of Forestar's shareholders and other customary closing conditions. We expect the preliminary S-4 to be filed by Forestar soon, and will have no other information to share until after the closing date. We are excited about the value that this relationship will create for both D.R. Horton and Forestar's shareholders. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At June 30th, our homebuilding liquidity included $461 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $900 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 520 basis points from a year ago to 24.8%. In May, we repaid $350 million of senior notes at their maturity, and the balance of our public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. We have $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.85 million shares of our common stock for $60.6 million, which partially offset dilution from equity awards. At June 30th, our shareholders' equity was $7.4 billion and book value per share was $19.87, up 14% from a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $200 million effective through July 2018, replacing the prior authorization. Our balanced capital approach is centered on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, payoff senior notes at maturity and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility. And we plan to maintain our disciplined, opportunistic position to improve the long-term value of the company. Jessica? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our homes closed to approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 88% to 90%. This will result in homes closed for the full year of fiscal 2017 in the range of 45,800 to 46,200 homes, and consolidated revenues of $13.9 billion to $14.1 billion, both of which are above the high-end of our initial guidance range. We anticipate our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter will be around 20%, and we expect our fourth quarter homebuilding SG&A to be in the range of 8.3% to 8.4% of homebuilding revenues. We estimate that our fourth quarter financial services operating margin will be in the range of 32% to 34%. We expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 35.2%, and our fourth quarter diluted share count to be around 380 million shares. We now expect our consolidated pre-tax operating margin for the full year of 2017 to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5%, and we expect approximately $300 million of positive cash flow from operations for the year. Our expectations are based on today's market conditions. Our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2018 are for consolidated revenues to increase 10% to 15%, and to achieve a consolidated pre-tax margin of approximately 11.5% for the full year of fiscal year 2018. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for a fourth consecutive year in a range of $300 million to $500 million. We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2018 will be approximately 35.5%, and that our diluted share count next year may increase up to 1%. Our preliminary guidance for fiscal 2018 is for our current operations and does not include any impact from Forestar. We do expect Forestar to be accretive, but not material to our earnings in fiscal year 2018, and we'll provide more information after we close on the transaction. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In closing, our third quarter and year-to-date growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We have been the largest builder in the United States for 15 consecutive years. According to Builder magazine's recent Local Leader issue, in 2016, we were the number one builder in four of the top five U.S. housing markets, and we believe, we will be the number one in all five of those markets in 2017. Also, in 2016, we were a top five builder in 28 of the top 50 largest housing markets. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns. We're well-positioned to do so, with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their focus and hard work. We look forward to finishing this year strong and to continue growing and improving our operations together in 2018. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, and good morning, guys. I'll start with the gross margin. Jessica, you mentioned that, third quarter you had 50 bps of legal, maybe, you could just give us an idea of what that is. But more importantly, fourth quarter around 20% implies, it may be down some. I guess, what are you all seeing as the drivers of that, when we're looking at price, cost. One of your competitors yesterday mentioned heightened incentives in a few markets, just maybe what's driving the thought process there of where you're going with your gross margin? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure. We'll have our detail on our gross margin, historically as we always do in our supplementary data, and what you'll see in that is in terms of the true just lot level prior to interest, property tax, warranty and lit, and those types of charges, our margin has been very, very steady. On a year-over-year basis, it was down about 20 basis points in that case, and that really is just driven by slightly higher land costs, which we have been talking about. So in terms of our stick and brick costs, our revenues have been covering that. They did on a year-over-year basis, and sequentially they were essentially on top of our cost increase. So we continue to see a very consistent gross margin, and then we did refer to the higher litigation costs, and that is \u2013 we've had that for a couple of quarters now, and that's why we continue to reiterate our 19% to 21% gross margin guide, as kind of our broader range outside of around 20%, because we do have some variability to some of those charges, and every once in a while it fluctuates a little bit. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough. And then, Bill you talked on the capital structure, your cash flow expected et cetera. Where do you all want to take your debt? I mean, at 20%, I think, most builders would love to be at that level already. So you're generating close to $0.5 billion next year even before Forestar, so what's the focus there on debt, and where do you want to take it? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We certainly like our position, we're in a flexible opportunistic position as we look at each year and look at our business plans, which we'll be spending a lot of time on that with our operators over the next couple of months, preparing, putting the kind of final touches on being prepared for fiscal 2018. We will look at where we feel like our cash flow will be, we'll look at our opportunities to invest. And then from there determine further actions with our cash, whether we take our debt down further or replace it, how much we do in terms of dividends and share repurchase, and then obviously further opportunities to invest in the business, including acquisitions... Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: ...we do have the purchase price of Forestar, which we would expect to be paid in Q1 of fiscal 2018 of around $560 million, so certainly that's a use of cash that we'll be looking at closely. We don't have a target debt level, we like being flexible, we're certainly \u2013 if we feel like that's the best decision for utilizing our cash is to continue to reduce our debt, we certainly will. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Do you have a targeted land spend? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're going to spend on land and development at a level, so that we maintain our lot portfolio at a similar level through the day, we do expect to continue to try to get more efficient with what we own, as we continue to grow our option position, but we would expect all things considered, if our revenues are expected to grow at 10% to 15%, we would expect our land spend to grow accordingly to just keep the lot pipeline sufficient for that growth. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Fair enough. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice quarter. Congrats on the consistent results here. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: My first question is, kind of a follow-up on that last line, I was thinking on the land portfolio, so you guys had really nice pickup in your lot supply this quarter, both owned and optioned, and congrats on getting to the 50/50 target. I guess, just thinking about the owned piece, which is about 125,000 lots, I know, you're on current underwriting, the goal and the target is to effectively get your cash back within two years there. You're owning up 25% year-over-year on the lot count, up 12% on the owned piece. If we just assume, you turned through those owned lots in a two-year period; and I know that's somewhat oversimplified, because there's legacy lots in there, which might be sitting there for a while. But it would imply a pretty sharp acceleration in the volume, even probably above that 10% to 15% rate in order to get to that type of cash generation. So just curious kind of how you see the volume trending, I know you guided to 10% to 15%, but with the lot count up seemingly more than that, is there anything else we should be paying attention to? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think, Alan, we have done a great job, our team has done a phenomenal job increasing the optioned lot position in line with the strategy we have. But we don't see an acceleration beyond the 10% to 15%, we're looking for next year. Even though, that lot supply is coming up, and we've got a two-year cash back return hurdle, we talked about; we look upon that as capital invested in land and lots, plus the margin we achieve on selling those homes goes back towards the capital reduction and how we reclaim that initial capital commitment. So projects, we're buying certainly have durations longer than two years. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So it's not exactly going to see that kind of ramp in growth beyond our 10% to 15% expectation. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Okay. That's helpful. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're investing to hit a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year-over-year. So it's \u2013 we have a plan, we're trying to be very discipline with that plan, maximizing returns as we continue to grow at this rate. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. And that's a very helpful clarification. Thank you for that. Second question, just in terms of market conditions, today. If you go back a year ago, your fiscal fourth quarter, you did see a bit of a pullback in your order growth. And I remember you guys talking about just in the market back then, you saw some discounting from some of the calendar reporting companies that you guys were instead deciding to focus more on building up your inventory in anticipation of the spring, which obviously worked out very well. So just now that you're roughly a month or so into your fiscal fourth quarter here, do you see a similar dynamic playing out, where other builders might be trying to capture some year-end sales here, and it might impact your order results in the fourth quarter, or does it feel like the market is a little bit firmer from a pricing standpoint? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Right now, it feels pretty firm. We monitor week-to-week, we're hitting targets week-to-week. Feel very good about the fourth quarter, the way it's setting up right now. We don't control what other builders do. We're not going to force sales just to have one quarter look better than the market's going to give us. But again, we're managing this in long-term. We're very interested in how we're setting up for 2018 right now, but feel very good about fourth quarter, both sales and deliveries. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the inventory position we have on the ground and coming out of the ground right now. Feeling good about getting set up for the first and second quarters of 2018. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks, Alan. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, good morning. Nice quarter. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, just wanted to ask you, order growth was up 50% (25:17) in the Southwest. Deliveries are crushing in the Southwest to Southeast and the East. From your standpoint, is demand coming in ahead of your expectations? And where are you seeing the most demand? I mean, the pace is really torrid, it's higher than we were anticipating, how are you explaining it, and do you view this as sustainable? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Southwest, really has been driven by our Phoenix operation. I think, we've talked over the last couple of quarters, we've been repositioning at Phoenix, pushing down a price point, realigning management, that's paying off. They are taking market share at a torrid pace right now. And the reality is that, they're improving their margin as they're doing it, so we feel very, very good about the Southwest. As far as the East and Florida, that's really just getting flags online, market's very good, been very good. Florida market's very difficult to get flags up, and get lots in front of you, and our operators out there have done a great job positioning... Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: ...taking some of the pressure off, the market's been carrying for all these years, let's focus little more on margin there. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. So this seems like you're seeing demand across the board plus great execution. Could you speak for a minute, what are you doing on the SG&A side? You obviously are executing well against your volume-driven operating strategy and getting great SG&A leverage. How much is left, is there room for improvement, is there anything you can do to lever your overheads to drive net margin performance? Great quarter and good luck. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Bob. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks, Bob. There's always a little more in SG&A, and really, our focus is just to continue to watch everything that we do. We certainly want to make sure we have an infrastructure to support growth, but just to watch everything that we spend, watch every ad that we make, every hire that we make to make sure that's absolutely needed. And then, if we're doing that, while we're growing the business at 10% to 15%, we would expect to continue to squeeze out a little bit more out of SG&A, whether that's 10 basis points or 30 basis points, it may fluctuate a bit, but we would expect to continue to push it down a little bit further as we go in 2018. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We ask our operators to get better every day, make it a little easier to build houses in the field and sell houses in the sales offices. And if we keep doing... Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : It's working? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're going to keep getting better. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sounds good guys, good luck. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Thanks. Good morning, folks. I wanted to ask about, as you look out at your community mix on the next couple of years, as you're looking at land now. Are you looking at changing the mix, maybe moving away from Emerald, where it seems like we're seeing a bit of saturation in a few markets that move up price points and shifting more towards Express and Freedom? And you mentioned, I think that your \u2013 was it \u2013 over $500,000 through sales were 6%, I think in terms of delivery volume, but 15%. Is that Emerald plus stuff that's over $500,000? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether or not your mix over time is likely continue to shift towards those low-end price point? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're going to shift our mix to where the market is, but we do want to maintain broad product offerings, regardless of cycle. It's just in terms of what percentage goes to what brand, it's going to vary depending on where we're at in the cycle, but we do plan to maintain an Emerald presence, and ultimately grow that business as well. And there'll be a time where the move-up buyer is back and very strong in that market, and we want to have that platform and that ability to deliver those higher end homes as well. The greater than $500,000 mark that we talk about, Carl, that is a mix. There is a lot of Emerald in that, but there is also some Horton products that falls into that price point as well. So in our supplementary data we give both a brand stratification and a price point stratification where you can see both of those mixes, and what that looks like for a trailing eight quarters. Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Right. Of course. Thanks, Jess. And then, as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about how the Freedom rollout looks as we look forward over the next couple of years or so? And I think, if I recall correctly, the ramp was, I think, a third of your markets. And I'm just kind of curious, maybe a little more detail on how that's been rolling out, how absorptions are tracking too? Thanks so much. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Bob, it's David. We're very excited and very happy with the Freedom rollout. Positioning that product, it takes a little bit longer than the typical Express or Horton project, because there are certain zoning requirements that make it a better deal that take a little longer. The rollout, I think, we're 15 markets. We're starting to see it impact to a minimal extent right now on our closings, but I think over the next couple of years, it's going to be a very significant part of what we do. I think we've been guiding to a third to a quarter of our markets that rolled out. But... Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. We'll probably be closer to a quarter, just because it is a little bit slower as David mentioned versus a third we'd originally talked about. But we're very happy with our progress and expect that 15 markets to continue to grow as we move throughout 2018. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Probably start accelerating at some point because we do have a lot in pipeline that we're trying to get to market. Very excited though. It's going to be a \u2013 well, never mind, I'm not going to say the word. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Thanks, folks. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I almost gave you a Trumpism. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, just want to go back to the land and Forestar. And as said before, the increase in optioned lots has really been extremely impressive, essentially doubling it over the last six quarters or so. So the question is, as you look at Forestar now, over the next year or two. Clearly you haven't had an issue getting option lots on your own. The own portion is still up there; obviously getting a little under 50% was a great achievement as well. Going forward, do you anticipate that Forestar will be more \u2013 would you anticipate kind of essentially keeping your option lot supply on your own books going forward or would you say, effectively you're looking at all either owned and optioned kind of being funneled towards Forestar, and your overall lot position might stay at these levels, maybe even start to decline, and all incremental land deals, owned and optioned will be pushed towards Forestar? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Michael, this is Mike. We will continue to have direct relationships from D.R. Horton to our land development partners that we have across the country today and look to grow those relationships. In addition, we will continue to maintain a level of land purchasing at D.R. Horton and development. We see Forestar as being very helpful in us and not having to increase our development activities as we continue to grow the business. As we continue to see double-digit growth year-over-year, that calls for more and more lots to be needed by the builders to start houses on. We'd like to maintain our current development activities at a consistent level to where we are today, which is about half of our current level of development. But as we move forward and grow, grow more of our future home deliveries off of lots developed by others, whether they are third-party developers or whether they are projects that Forestar puts on the ground for the homebuilder. So we Forestar as an important part of land and lot strategy going forward, but it's another supplement to the relationships we've built with land developers across the country and we'll continue to invest in those relationships moving forward. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. No, that's helpful, Mike. I guess, just secondly on the fiscal 2018 pre-tax margin guidance at 11.5%, that compares to fiscal 2017 of 11.3% to 11.5%, so it seems like, if I'm getting that right, and thinking about the components, you're more or less looking for a steady gross margin, and maybe flat to 20 bps of incremental leverage on the SG&A. So just wanted to know if I'm thinking about that right, and if that's the case, it appears that, relative to a few years ago, you're more or less approaching kind of like a steady-state margin, all else equal from a \u2013 let's say a pricing and cost inflation dynamic standpoint; really going forward, the bus is going to be more driven by top line, I mean, absolutely trying to get a little bit more on SG&A, but is that fair in terms of how to think about it? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, Mike. And in terms of the guidance to 11.5%, that is the right way to think about it. We continue to guide, and have seen very stable gross margins, and then continue to leverage SG&A a bit. And at this early day here in July, talking about the full fiscal year 2018, we do feel like we can squeeze out a little bit, so guiding to 11.5%, a slight improvement is where we feel comfortable today. As we get closer, and as we get into 2018, if we feel like we've got more opportunity, we will certainly adjust our guidance there as well. But within \u2013 certainly then, beyond the next quarter, and as we look to where we are as a business, we feel really good, and you're kind of in the middle of our normal operating margin range at about 20%, historically 19% to 21% is kind of in a range, and we've been at a very steady level, kind of in the middle of this range, really for the last couple of years. And we feel like that's still where the business is today, and then as we grow our volume, certainly the biggest driver of our earnings growth is going to come from our top line growth, growing at 10% to 15%. And to the extent that the market gives us a bit on the gross margin, we're certainly going to take it, and then we're certainly going to continue to try to drive a bit more operating margin from SG&A. But we're not projecting significant increases in operating margin, but certainly a continued consistent margin in order to improve it on the SG&A side. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then, quick clarification, the quarter markets for Freedom brands, that's expected to be by the end of this fiscal year, correct? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: 2017. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Basically, towards the end of 2017. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lovallo of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey guys, thanks for getting me in here. The first question would be, I guess, how would you characterize kind of order growth throughout the quarter, and maybe more broadly, how would you characterize the overall demand environment? And some of your competitors have said that demand remains very strong and quite possibly is accelerating. Would you agree with that kind of characterization? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: This time of year in the market, I don't know, the accelerating part. I will say, it's very consistent market. It's week-to-week, flag-to-flag, it's just kind of almost boring, it's so consistent. It's a great market for people that can operate efficiently and put good value in front of buyers, and we're seeing the benefit of that. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then in terms of the 10% to 15% top line growth, what kind of community count growth are you kind of contemplating in that? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: John, we did see for the first time this quarter, our community count tick up ever so slightly on a year-over-year basis, and I think, the second quarter in a row, it went up sequentially. So we've kind of hit that inflection point that we've been expecting to come, in the back half of the year. We wouldn't expect it to grow significantly in 2018, but I think, a low, probably no higher than mid-single-digit range, maybe by the time, we get to the end of 2018. So continued improvement and absorption, supplemented by a little bit of community count growth next year. John Lovallo II - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'm going to kind of try and go at your 10% to 15% growth target for next year. This year was very much comprised of pace, and the way we look at pace; sequentially, things have been pretty seasonal and pretty predictable. If that were the case again, it seems as though your approach on these communities and pace would lead to perhaps the same level of unit volumes that you've seen, orders going into closings. Is there something about your business that would \u2013 if demand were to pick up, and not be boring, could you or would you stop yourself from exceeding that 15% volumes? Is there something intuitively designed around your business that would stop you from getting that if the market wanted to go higher? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No, I don't think that's \u2013 certainly not or we're going to have not sell houses when people want to buy them, that's not going to be the case. I will say, if we have an opportunity to stay on pace and increase margin, we're going to do that. So if in fact, we do see some kind of acceleration, we will take a little margin and we will take a little bit more pace. The end goal for every flag is to maximize a return we make on that investment, and if that means tweak in margin, then we'll tweak margin; if that means tweak in pace, we'll tweak pace. It's good times for us. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So since it's so boring, and you guys went to the stable gross margin about two years ago, and it seems certainly guidance from other builders, there's been more than two now, have talked about kind of really sequential improvements looking into the back half of the year, which would be a change from the kind of compression trends that we had seen in recent years. And I ask David, because you said, if the market gives us gross margins, we'll take it, I'm sure, it's kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it does appear that other builders are finding stability that you're seeing? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. And that's not tongue-in-cheek, that is our operating platform and thought process. We set these communities to hit a certain absorption target, and we adjust margin to maximize the return at that target. And that's why we're so consistent on our deliveries. And first of all, we're able to build houses on a \u2013 without expanding our bill cycles. I mean, it does a lot of good things for us. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Would you say that you're more inclined to see gross margin expansion this year versus last year, kind of could you couch that considering we're seeing stability in others, and you were the first to see stability, so logically you might be... David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Clearly depends on what the market does. Right now, very consistent margins, very consistent absorptions, we've got a good balance as we \u2013 the other builders that were seeing this acceleration are correct, and yeah, I would say, we're going to see some margin expansion. I'm just telling you, right now, what we're seeing is a very solid, very consistent high-demand, low-inventory market that feels like it's going to continue. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Ken, I do you think you hear other builders talk to seasonality in their gross margins as well, which I don't know, if that's playing into their commentary for the back-half of the year. But we don't have fixed costs in our gross margin. And so we don't experience that kind of seasonality in the back-half of the year. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, less the fixed costs then... Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: What is the commission percentage generally that goes into your gross margin and out of SG&A? Thank you. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's around 2.7%, 2.8%, at times up to 3% in our margin. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Hey, guys, it's Steve Kim. Apologies, if this question was asked. But curious about the gross margins for next year implied by the pre-tax GAAP number. We know that, that pre-tax GAAP number includes a lot of things in it, and one of the things you mentioned today, was that, you have this litigation expense that was going to run a little higher, and had been for a couple of quarters now. So I was curious as to what in the way of your outlook for next year, you're embedding in terms of the trajectory for, either warranty and litigation or anything else that might be a little sort of unusual, that typically gets backed out into 2018? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, we do see some more variability in items like warranty and litigation that we do in other components of our margin, but our guidance for next year is still kind of right down the middle of our historic range at around 20%, and there certainly could be some quarterly variability, as we've seen from time-to-time in those other areas, but we're not anticipating anything unusual, either positive or negative in terms of those other items. We do continue to see the benefit of a reduced debt with our interest charges and our margin continuing to be reduced, but at the same time, we do see cost pressures in the core business, especially on the lot side, right now, that we're absorbing a little bit as well. But again, we don't see significant volatility, and aren't embedding any significant volatility into our assumptions. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Got it. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the expectations we're putting out there kind of reflect the increased lot costs that we've seen coming through in some of the closing, that's kind of an outcropping of our land and lot strategy is to try to buy more lots finished, see that come through and is helping us to drive our returns up, our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory has improved 200 basis points over the past 12 months, and that's been very helpful for us. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah, now I know, clearly. And then, with respect to Express specifically, I believe that, when you first launched that product line, your anticipation was that it was going to garner lower gross margins, but then as you actually got into it, do effective execution, you actually, I believe found that the margins there have been much more comparable to your company average, I was curious as to whether that's still the case today? And whether that's your expectation going forward? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes. Steve, you stated that dead-on, our Express gross margin has been better than we originally anticipated when we launched the brand in the spring of 2014, and it's right in line with our company average, and we really don't see anything today that would anticipate that changing as we move throughout fiscal 2018. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Excellent. Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Can you talk a little bit to, perhaps what you're seeing in the Texas markets, it seems like you had some good results down there, can you just talk a little bit about what's actually going on, on the ground? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Texas is a very, very good market for us. We benefit from being incredibly well-positioned, I think, we're the top builder in every market in Texas. And just great execution combined with solid demand and tight, tight inventories. No, we love Texas. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, I'm wondering if you could just dive in a little bit more into the raw material inflation that you're seeing, kind of what's been going on there, and how you're thinking about that as we move through the fourth quarter and then into 2018? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure, Sue. We haven't seen any significant moves in our raw material cost inputs, I know lumber's been the headline. Out there it really \u2013 it has been a lot of headline noise. We've seen a slight tick up in our lumber costs year-to-date, but nothing significant, and we clearly offset that in terms of our revenues offsetting our stick and brick costs. So we're really not seeing any noticeable changes in any of our raw material costs at this point. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And so you expect that to stay relatively consistent then? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: A quick question on the Midwest segment and the order decline there. Can you talk about geographically what's going on and how you guys are addressing it? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The Midwest segment's a pretty small region for us, some of those markets, we have reworked a little bit of the management leadership in one of those markets, and we feel pretty good about where that team is going to be positioned in 2018 and 2019. So, I think we're going to see some improvements in those markets. They've been pretty consistent, they're just like a lot of other places, fairly supply constraint. Chicago market, still a little slow, seems to be little slow coming out compared to the balance of the country, but the other markets, I think we'll see some good things in 2018 and 2019. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And then, the other question I had, just to Express specifically, what type of pricing power are you seeing there, and I know some of your competitors have announced new brand names and new products to maybe target that brand name or to target Express, what are you guys seeing right now, and how's the pricing power for you guys on that Express brand? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, the key to the Express brand is affordability and making the \u2013 keeping that very broad customer segment where the most people can buy the most house. And so, the pricing power is probably higher or greater than where we have pushed pricing in Express because we are very sensitive to maintaining a very affordable product. Those buyers typically are not the most sophisticated, and you can make kind of a slow conveyor \u2013 presentation with them, but at the end of the day, we're selling houses to people that we want to sell the second, third and fourth house. We want it to be a great investment for them, and we want to give them a great house. So that's a long way of saying, yes, there's probably pricing power there. But as long as we can maintain the margins we're making and absorptions we're making, and retain a very affordable, very well built house, we lack that model. We lack what it's doing for our returns. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And Jay, you will see in our supplemental information that our average ASP on Express continues to tick up a little bit. That's more of a reflection of our geographic mix though, as we continue to roll Express out, and it continues to penetrate some of the higher-priced markets a little bit greater than it had been in prior quarters, but it's not \u2013 we obviously will move price somewhat, but we are continuing to stay very focused on affordability. And then, in terms of other builders in the entry level space, first time homebuyer space, certainly we're seeing other builders start to introduce new names, new brands, new communities out there, but as we've said for a long while, that market is pretty large, and there's a lot of demand from those entry level buyers today. So there's a lot of room for other participants to participate in that market, but we're still focused on penetrating that and gaining as much market share as we can there because we feel like there's still a lot of demand and very little supply to that entry level buyer. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Sounds great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko of SIG. Please go ahead, sir. John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group : Hi, good morning. I wanted to just clarify your tone on the share buybacks. I mean, your debt levels have come down further, generating cash, you bought back some stock this quarter, as you always do to offset the stock comp, but you upped the authorization. So is this more status quo \u2013 should we think of the buyback approach status quo, or is there an incremental focus on share repurchase here as you generate cash and get your debt levels lower because you did seem to call it out a bit more in the prepared comments as well. Just trying to gauge what the real message is? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Jack. We have had an authorization outstanding for quite some time on share repurchases. Actually \u2013 and we've talked about potentially starting to repurchase shares to offset dilution, actually this quarter was the first quarter in which we've actually repurchased any shares under that authorization. So, it was a step forward for us into an era of beginning to start to offset our dilution from our share creep. And we would expect to continue to at least partially offset that dilution, we \u2013 our board did increase our authorization to a $200 million level effective for the next year; that is an increase from the prior-year authorization of $100 million. So certainly as the business is growing, as our profits grow, as we continue to expect strong cash flow generation, we do expect to continue to be able to repurchase shares within that authorization going forward. So, yes, we are saying a little bit more about it because we've actually repurchased some shares this quarter. John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay. And then, around your 2018 outlook, you talk about driving more of the top line through absorption, you're also going to grow, I think, Freedom's going to be somewhat of a driver of growth. How do we think about Freedom versus Express absorptions. Do they absorb about the same faster, slower and what's that mean to that expectation for further absorption improvement next year? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: If we're \u2013 we will find out what happens as time goes on. I can tell you the way we are believing, it's going to take place right now is, the Freedom will come in at a little lower absorption than the Express program, but we think, we can get a little bit more margin there, so the returns are going to be equivalent to that push to 20% we're trying to get to, and it's \u2013 right now, we're seeing very, very strong demand. Part of it is, it's just nothing else \u2013 nothing else in the market like it. It's just been harder to roll it out than we really kind of thought it would, because of zoning requirements, and really city approvals and things. But we're very excited about it. I think, it's going to be great. John Gregory Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alex Barr\u00f3n of Housing Research Center. Please go ahead. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Yeah, thanks. Congratulations on the results. I wanted to ask about the leverage; so you guys, I think, at this point have the lowest leverage of any builder. Curious if you guys, the thought process is to stay here or you're just being opportunistic about more \u2013 other opportunities? And my second question has to do with, heard some rumblings that some of these rental companies are thinking of developing entire communities for, I guess, single family communities for rents, and giving your platform of being very efficient to develop homes; wondering if that's something that you guys are potentially contemplating on doing, entering those types of deals? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I'll take the second question first, Alex. Thank you very much for your comments. We've heard some of the rumblings about that as well, probably just rumors or articles written here and there. We've not really explored the build out of a community for ourselves as a full rental community. We've had great demand selling houses, and generally, we prefer to sell them, and it's more capital-efficient for us, and that's the way it has historically worked for us. We'll see how they do with the full on rental communities \u2013 we do see it's something that can make good business sense for us to bring our building platform to bear, community development expertise to bear in developing a rental community, maybe that's something we will pursue. But at this point, we have no immediate plans to pursue that. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And then, Alex, in terms of the leverage, we do lock our flexible opportunistic position we're in today, as we look at opportunities to invest in the business; we just try to balance that with where we want to keep our liquidity. And to the extent that we have capital available to continue to reduce debt, we certainly will. But if we see enough opportunities to invest in the business that we need to replace the debt, and not reduce it further, then we'll do that as well. So we certainly like our position, willing to take the debt lower if need be and the cash flow is available, but certainly, it's got us in a really strong position to be able to really take advantage of opportunities as we see them in the marketplace. Alex Barr\u00f3n - Housing Research Center LLC : Great. Thanks. Congrats again. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks, Alex. Operator : Thank you. We're showing time for one additional question today. Our last question will be coming from Mike Dahl of Barclays. Please go ahead. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Couple of quick ones. First, related to the guide and some of the comments around absorption and community count. Just hoping to get a little clarification on just how the 10% to 15% in dollar terms breaks out, because presumably mix is continuing to shift towards Freedom and Express, which while you've had some pricing power there is still mixing lower. So what's generally your expectation for how ASPs play out for next year when you kind of add that altogether? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So we don't give specific guidance on ASP or community count really. I mean, we end up talking about it, because obviously you guys want to hear about that. So we do talk about it directionally, but no specific guidance for a reason, because those are two of the hardest for us to predict. ASP being very much market-driven and coupled with a lot of mix impacts that we have had going on that you already referenced, Mike. So we continue to expect our ASP to be around flat. In reality, it continue to creep up at a low-single-digit percentage here for the last year or two. So we'll see as we move throughout 2018, but once again, not really expecting a whole lot of movement on the ASP front. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's still helpful. And then, secondly, just if we think about some of the comments around your price, obviously there's kind of a push and pull. You've got some power in the market on the low-end, but you want to manage and make sure it's an affordable product in those segments. You mentioned that the cost side is fairly benign for you guys. So can you give us any level of quantification since overall margins are stable, you know what the underlying land costs are inflating at currently, and what the embedded expectation is for 2018? Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure, we saw our lot cost at the beginning of the year, it'd be up a high-single-digit percentage. Now that we've moved into the back half of the year, that's moderated a bit, and this quarter on a year-over-year basis was up a mid-single-digit percentage. So we would expect in 2018 to continue to have an increase in our lot costs, but hopefully it maintains that mid-single-digit range that we're at today or you know trends down just ever so slightly to a low-single-digit. Michael Dahl - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks and good luck into year-end. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Jessica Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Donna. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today, and look forward to speaking with you again in November, to share what we think is going to be a great year-end. And to the Horton family, thank you for yet another strong quarter, and an outstanding execution in 2017 . It is an honor to be here, and I appreciate everything you did. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-K next week. After this call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team finished the year strong. Pretax income for the fourth quarter increased 12% to $486 million on $4.2 billion of revenue. And our pretax operating margin improved 10 basis points to 11.7%. Over the year, we delivered results in line with or better than original guidance we shared at the start of last year, with consolidated pretax income increasing 18% to $1.6 billion on $14.1 billion of revenue. We closed 45,751 homes this year, an increase of 5,442 homes or 14% over last year. Our consolidated pretax margin for the year improved 30 basis points to 11.4%, and our return on inventory improved 120 basis points to 16.6%. During the fourth quarter, we generated $626 million of cash from operations, bringing our total to $435 million for the year and to $1.8 billion over the past three years. These results reflect consistent, strong performance across our broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both our revenue and pretax profits, while generating annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns, with 26,200 homes in inventory at the end of the last year, positive sales trends in October and 249,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for another strong year in 2018. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income for the fourth quarter increased 10% to $313 million or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $284 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pretax income increased 12% to $486 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $433 million, and homebuilding pretax income increased 13% to $458 million compared to $405 million. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 87%. As a result, our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 11% to $4 billion on 13,165 homes closed, up from $3.6 billion on 12,247 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $306,500, up 3% compared to the prior year, due to an increase in our average sales price per square foot and a higher percentage of closings in our West region this quarter as a result of the hurricane impact in other regions. In the fourth quarter, our Express Homes brand accounted for 37% of our homes sold, 34% of homes closed and 26% of home sales revenue. And for the year, it accounted for 34% of homes sold, 31% of homes closed and 24% of home sales revenue. Homes for higher-end, move-up and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 under both our D.R. Horton and Emerald Homes brands were 8% of our homes closed and 20% of our home sales revenue in the fourth quarter.  And for the year, they accounted for 7% of homes closed and 17% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 21 markets across 12 states, and customer response to these homes and communities offering a low-maintenance lifestyle at an affordable price has been positive. Freedom Homes accounted for 1% of both our homes sold and closed in the fourth quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 19% from the year-ago quarter to $3.1 billion. And homes sold increased 18% to 10,333 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased to 2% from the prior year quarter. Our average sales price of net sales orders increased 1% to $301,600, and our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 25%. The value of our backlog increased 8% from a year ago to $3.7 billion, with an average sales price per home of $302,200. And homes in backlog increased 7% to 12,329 homes. We are very pleased with our current sales pace, and October sales were in line with our fiscal 2018 business plan, supporting our growth expectations for the year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 20.3%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter and up 50 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. The sequential improvement in our gross margin was primarily due to lower litigation charges in the current quarter. In today's housing market, we continue to expect our average home sales gross margin to be around 20%, with quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%, due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact in warranty, litigation and interest cost. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.6%, down 20 basis points from the prior year quarter. This quarter's SG&A includes approximately $3 million of Forestar transaction costs and expenses related to the recent hurricanes. Homebuilding SG&A for the full year improved 40 basis points to 8.9% compared to 9.3% in 2016, as our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth, and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2018. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $27.7 million. For the year, financial services pretax income increased 27% to $113 million on $350 million of revenues, representing a 32% pretax operating margin. 96% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 55% of our home buyers. SHA and VA loans accounted for 46% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 44% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the year with 26,200 homes in inventory; 13,800 of our total homes were unsold, with 9,700 in various stages of construction and 4,100 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 13% more homes in inventory, putting us in a very strong position to start 2018. Our fourth quarter investments in lots, land, and development totaled $771 million, of which, $424 million was to replenish finished lots and land, and $347 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.5 billion in lots, land, and development. We are planning to replenish our own land and lot supply in 2018 at a rate to support our expected growth and revenues. David? David Auld : This year, we achieved our previously stated goal of a 50% owned, 50% optioned land and lot pipeline. We believe we can increase the option portion of our pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with the current level. At September 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 249,000 lots, of which, 125,000 are owned and 124,000 are controlled through optioned contracts. 91,000 of our total lots are finished, of which 33,000 are owned and 58,000 are optioned. We have increased our option lot position 35% from a year ago, and we plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across our national footprint to further increase the option portion of our land supply. Our 249,000 total lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and a sufficient lot supply to support our targeted growth. Mike? Mike Murray : On October 5, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly traded residential real estate company, for approximately $560 million in cash. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country and increasing our optioned land and lot pipeline to enhance operational efficiency and returns. At the acquisition date, Forestar had operations in 14 markets in 10 states, where it owned, directly or through joint ventures, interest in 44 residential and mixed-use projects. Both companies are currently identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform. Since the closing months ago, Forestar has been evaluating approximately 15 D.R. Horton-sourced opportunities located primarily in Texas, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas, two of which Forestar has already closed. These 15 communities will yield approximately 8,000 finished lots, the majority of which could be sold at D.R. Horton in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Forestar's aggregate peak inventory investment for this portfolio of projects is expected to be approximately $200 million, and we expect Forestar to commit at least $400 million of capital, primarily to D.R. Horton-sourced projects during 2018. We are also actively working with Forestar on plans for their existing projects and are in discussions for D.R. Horton to potentially purchase approximately 3,000 lots from Forestar's current portfolio. The post-merger interactions between the D.R. Horton and Forestar teams have been very productive, and we are pleased with the progress we're making on the integration. We are confident that Forestar's growth is likely to exceed the original projections outlined in our slide deck from June. We continue to be excited about the value that this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. As a public company, Forestar will continue to file quarterly and annual reports, as well as any other required public information, but they will not host quarterly conference calls. D.R. Horton will be handling Forestar's Investor Relations to allow the Forestar team to focus solely on integration and operations during the coming months. Forestar operates on a calendar year-end and will file its 2017 annual report by mid-March of 2018. We do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on our fiscal 2018 earnings. We plan to outline the purchase accounting for the transaction and presentation of our consolidated results, including Forestar, at our first quarter earnings release and conference call in January. And we will provide an update on our integration progress at that time. We expect to provide initial Forestar guidance for 2018 in January. We then expect to provide additional 2018 guidance for Forestar on our second quarter call in April, following Forestar's calendar year in reporting. Bill? Bill Wheat : During the fourth quarter, we generated $626 million of cash flow from operations. For the full year, our cash flow from operations was $435 million, in line with our original guidance. Our cash flow generation exceeded our updated guidance, due to better-than-expected closings in late September and a greater-than-anticipated impact from the hurricanes on land development and construction activity. At September 30, our homebuilding liquidity consisted of $973 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 520 basis points from a year ago to 24%. The balance of our public notes outstanding at September 30 was $2.4 billion, and we have a total of $400 million of senior notes that mature in fiscal 2018, which we will likely refinance in the next few months. We ended the year with a shareholders' equity balance of $7.7 billion and book value per common share of $20.66, up 13% from a year ago. Based on our financial metrics and positive outlook for fiscal 2018, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $12.05 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $190 million to our shareholders in fiscal 2018. We repurchased 1.85 million shares of our common stock for $60.6 million, during fiscal 2017 and currently have a $200 million share repurchase authorization outstanding effective through July 2018. David? David Auld : Our balanced-capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to improve the long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels, and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect to generate at least $500 million of cash from operations in 2018, growing to over $1 billion annually in 2020. As we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt, decrease our leverage, increase our dividend and repurchase shares to offset dilution, with a target to keep our outstanding share count flat beginning in 2020. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, our expectations for fiscal 2018 are consistent with what we shared on our July call and are based on today's market conditions. They also exclude any impact from Forestar. In fiscal 2018, we expect to generate a consolidated pretax margin of 11.5% to 11.7%. We expect to generate consolidated revenues between $15.5 billion and $16.3 billion and to close between 50,500 and 52,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for the full year will be around 20% with potential quarterly fluctuations that may range from 19% to 21%. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues will be around 8.7%, with our SG&A percentage higher in the first half of the year and lower in the second half. We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be 30% to 32%, with the first 2 quarters of the year lower and the third and fourth quarters higher. We forecast an income tax rate for 2018 of approximately 35.2%, and that our diluted share count will increase by less than 1%. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations of at least $500 million in 2018, excluding any impact from the consolidation of Forestar in our financial statements. Our fiscal 2018 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season, and we plan to update our expectations as necessary each quarter, as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clearer. We do not currently expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's earnings in fiscal 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 83% to 86%. We anticipate our first quarter home sales gross margin will be around 20%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be the range of 9.5% to 9.8%. David? David Auld : In closing, the strength of our team and operating platform across the country allowed us to deliver full year results for 2017 in line with or better than guidance we provided at the start of last year. While growing our revenue and pretax profits at a double-digit pace again this year, we generated $435 million of positive cash flow from operations and improved our annual homebuilding return on inventory by 120 basis points to 16.6%. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pretax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improved returns. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on our 16th consecutive year as the largest builder by volume in the United States, and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2018 as we celebrate our 40th anniversary year. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. The first question is, as D.R. Horton becomes more asset-light, cash flow should improve pretty meaningfully, in our view, very meaningfully. Where do you think free cash flow conversion can kind of trend over the next few years? And if it is, as solid as we think at least, I mean, would you be open to more aggressively repurchasing shares? Mike Murray : John, we're taking this one step at a time, but we've basically stated that we expect to achieve the cash flow from operations greater than $500 million this year, and we do expect that to ramp up over the next couple of years. We expect that by 2020, our cash flow from operations should be in excess of $1 billion. That's our estimate today and our guidance today. But certainly, we have - we do have high expectations for our ability to increase our option portion of our land position, and certainly, Forestar is a part of that as well. And over the next year as we build out Forestar's platform and it begins to contribute a greater impact on our overall operations, I do think we do have a lot of cash flow generation capability that could, potentially, exceed what we're guiding to now for the next couple of years. On share repurchase, we are starting to repurchase more shares than we have historically, and our target right now is to increase those share repurchases to a point that it fully offsets our dilution, so that our share count will remain flat by 2020. Certainly, to the extent that we're able to generate more cash than we're currently guiding in time that, that could change as well over the longer term. But right now, in the three-year window, we're targeting to offset dilution over the next couple of years. John Lovallo : Okay, that's helpful. And then, touching on the options. The 60% option percentage that you guys have out there now, you maybe have been talking about that for a bit. Has the bogey changed at all, given the inclusion of Forestar? And I mean is there anything that could prevent you from reaching much higher levels, call it, 70%, even 75%? Bill Wheat : I think nothing's really changed with regard to the 60% target with Forestar. That's part of our strategy to achieve that. Over time, once we achieve that goal, we will continue to set higher goals for ourselves. But it's one developer, one contract, one project at a time that we make these relationships work. John Lovallo : Thanks very much guys. Bill Wheat : Thanks John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hi guys, good morning. Congrats on a great year and the progress on Forestar. Exciting to see that moving forward. First question on Forestar, you mentioned a few markets where you've already sourced in options and deals. I think those are all existing Forestar markets, if I remember correctly. I'm just curious, as you're ramping up the personnel within Forestar, have you looked into bringing that operation into some of your more higher cost markets like California, Pacific Northwest, where obviously, the land investment is going to be a much greater percentage of the home value; it would certainly tie up a lot of more capital there. Any thoughts on really the viability of optioning a meaningful percentage of lots out in these higher-cost markets? Bill Wheat : To your first point, we have - Forestar has acquired a project in Florida, which is not in a market they've been operating in. And we're looking to - as we've talked about kind of bootstrap our way in, leverage the growth of Forestar into new markets, leveraging the Horton platform existing in those markets. With regard to sort of a higher-land-basis markets, we have identified a couple of projects to take a look at up in the Pacific Northwest, but because they are more capital-intensive, they may be a little slower to grow their ramp there. Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then second question on M&A, in general, from obviously a big deal here in the space over the last couple of weeks. I want to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly. On one hand, you're definitely looking to shift the business towards more asset-light, which clearly, the market is rewarding and seems to like. On the other hand, I know you guys have always been very focused on scale in both local, as well as national and take a lot of pride in being the largest builder in the country, and certainly, there's advantages to go along with that. So, I'm just curious now as you think about the allocation of capital, would it be inconsistent for you to continue to look toward M&A opportunities on the traditional homebuilding side of the business, even if that means temporarily lengthening the land book if it comes with the benefit of increased scale? David Auld : Alan, we look at deals every day, and we'll continue to do that. We're looking for a fit. We're looking for something that is additive that we can grow, and we look at them from the same stamp when we look at a piece of land. We're going to - it's got to be a fit, culturally, for us, for the people. But from a capital outlay standpoint, we want to return the cash over the asset base within two years. And so that makes it difficult to look at the great big deals. We've had a lot of success integrating small private companies in over the last four or five years, like the way - like what that does for our company, like the fact that you get the return of the cash pretty quick. We'll look at them, yes. We're going to look at them, we're going to continue look at them. But it's a tough hurdle to get over. Alan Ratner : Alright, good luck. Bill Wheat : Thank you, Alan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Stephen East : Thank you, good morning guys. Just quickly to follow on Alan's M&A question. I know Forestar's not a big deal for you all, but it's a big change in the way you all operate. So, is your appetite for M&A changed at all temporarily? David Auld : No. I mean, I think what we're trying to do is look at things on a consistent basis with a lot of discipline and does it make us better over the long term. So, kind of what we talked about before is what we're going to continue to do and continue to talk about. Stephen East : Fair enough. Here comes my compound question here. Forestar. Several things, I sort of call its first 100 days plan, maybe, give a little bit more detail about what you all were talking about there, as you look maybe over the next year or two, how that evolves. And did I hear you right that you expect that they would commit $400 million of capital in 2018? And then if so, just wanting to understand on your land in development, the $3.5 million you did this year, does that change with the Forestar spending $400 million or so in 2018? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Steven, I know we gave a lot of detail on the call. We've actually got a time line included in the presentation that we'll post that will outline kind of over the next year what we're planning on giving you further on Forestar. It also includes some of those numbers we talked about. But you did hear that correctly that we're planning to commit at least $400 million of capital, primarily to D.R. Horton-sourced projects starting 2018. And that doesn't mean we're only going to use $400 million for Forestar this year. We're looking at other capital sources. Primarily in the near term, we'll likely put together a revolving credit facility, and we'll also be recycling through some of their assets and bringing that cash back in the door as well. Bill Wheat : And Steven, in terms of our land spend at D.R. Horton, we're in year one of Forestar, and as they build out their portfolio, we will still be replenishing our lot supply in 2018 at D.R. Horton, and we expect to keep our owned-lot supply relatively flat, while we grow our option position with other land developers and as Forestar grows their platform as well. So, our land-spend in order to replenish lots and land at D.R. Horton in fiscal 2018 will continue to be at or above the same level that we did this past year. Certainly, over the long term, there's potential for that to not have to grow at the same pace and not have to replenish as much, but we've got to build out the Forestar platform, as well as our third-party developer platforms further. Jessica Hansen : Consistent with what you've seen in each of these last few years though, we would expect our inventories to grow at a slower rate than our revenues which will drive that continued improvement in returns. Stephen East : Got you. All right. Great answer. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Bob Wetenhall from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Bob Wetenhall : Hi, good morning, and thanks for all the color. Congrats on a good year. I want to go in the time machine back to 2006 when you delivered 53,000 homes. And I think that's the peak deliveries for Horton since it's been a public company. And you're talking about $1 billion of free cash flow by 2020, which is a remarkable number. So, I was just trying to figure out, like in - if you're - between 2016 and 2017, you added about 5,000 homes, and it looks like you're going to add 6,000 homes in 2018, what's the growth profile that you're, kind of, underwriting to, to get that $1 billion of free cash flow by 2020? David Auld : Bob, we plan on double-digit growth next three years. I mean that's how we're setting up the operations of this company. And we're going to get a little better building each house. And we feel like the market has got some legs and it's a double-digit growth year over year over year, you generate a lot of cash. Bob Wetenhall : Just to be tactical about it, you're jacked up about the outlook, it sounds like? Bill Wheat : That's a technical term, yes, Bob. 10% to 15% growth over the next three years and continue to get more efficient and generate stronger returns, which would mean inventory will grow at a slower pace than revenues. Jessica Hansen : And it's specifically a revenue target. This year, you'll see in our fiscal 2018 guidance, we're expecting it mainly to come from closings growth. As we go over the next couple of years, we'll give more specifics, but the target is for double-digit revenue growth. David Auld : I will tell you, Bob, the market feels really good. The positioning of this company with its people and its communities - never been better. So yes, we are pretty jacked up. Bob Wetenhall : Sounds good. Just one other question. Obviously, you have a very positive view of the marketplace. I wanted to get your view, if the Fed hikes next year, say 3x or 4x, does that put a damper on your ability to grow by reducing affordability? Or do you think where Horton's position in the market and renters becoming buyers, that's really not an issue, and instead, the Fed's tightening because the economy is good and they need to do it, there's job growth and that just means you're going to see more buyers? Thanks, and good luck. Congrats on a great year. David Auld : Thank you, Bob. We're going to adjust to the market if affordability continues to drive. We're going to meet the market where we need to. The best thing that can happen for homebuilding is a strong economy and job creation. So, given those two things, we'll figure out a way to sell houses, I can guarantee it. Bob Wetenhall : Lot of confidence. Thanks again, good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Good morning guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about store count for next year. You are, I think, relatively flat on community count this year, but absorptions were up particularly well back half. As you look out to next year, do you expect to increase that store count a little bit more and that be more of a driver of order growth to support delivery volume? Or will it continue to be absorption? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Carl. One of the hardest things for us to predict. And as I remind everyone, I think, every quarter, is why we don't give specific guidance regarding community count. But our community count was at 2% year-over-year to finish the year out. It was actually down 1% sequentially. So, as we look and move through fiscal 2018, we really expect it to be flat, no more than slightly up. So, a continued story of absorptions maybe with a little bit of community count growth to drive that 10% to 15% increase in units this year. Carl Reichardt : Okay, Jessica. And then, Bill, just a clarification question on cash flow for fourth quarter, better than you expected, and you said part of that was due to a lack of the ability to develop, so not spend, due to hurricanes and then also some additional closings. Can you sort of parse out for me the dollars associated with each of those two elements in terms of what came in better versus what didn't happen and would go into Q1 or later quarters? Thanks. Bill Wheat : I don't have the specific dollars in front of me, Carl, here but the delta on the closing side, we provided revised guidance in mid-September of about 85% backlog conversion. Our operators were able to over deliver on that in late September, and we delivered 87%, so that 2% change in conversion rate would be the delta on the closing side. The remainder would be less spending on inventory, primarily in the land development side, a little bit of land back as well.  As in the - primarily in the areas that were affected by the hurricane, there was - where there was certainly a slowdown and some disruption in activity there. And that was a little bit greater than we anticipated. And so, the remainder of that cash flow delta would come from our land activity. We would have expected our annual land spend and development spend to be a bit higher than it was. And so clearly, that's a timing thing that does slide into 2018. But even with that, we still expect to exceed $500 million of cash flow from operations in 2018. Carl Reichardt : All right. Thanks Bill, great job guys. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone and congrats again on the Forestar - completing that transaction. A couple of questions around that as obviously, that's kind of been the primary focus of investors and how that kind of reshapes your company over the next few years, or perhaps, continues on your current path of more optioning and better returns. When you talk about the operating cash flow outlook for 2018 of $500 million, which I think is up from your prior guidance of $300 million to $500 million, it seems like part of that is due to the Forestar shift, if I'm thinking about it right, with the $400 million of capital expected to be of Forestar to use for D.R. Horton-sourced deals. So just trying to get a sense of maybe what the operating cash flow would look like, if you netted out the Forestar investment, is it as simple as $500 million minus $400 million? I know you talked about some recycling of cash as well from Forestar. I guess that's my first question. Bill Wheat : Mike, I think, looking at the $400 million we expect Forestar to commit in 2018, not all of that will be spent in 2018. That's the commitment to those projects. As they develop and execute over time, that - some of that will be spent in 2018, some of it in 2019. So, it's not all $400 million is going to go out on the - when you start the project. The other part of it is that Forestar does have a current portfolio of projects, a lot of lots under contracts to builders to sell over the next 12 months that they'll be continuing to deliver lots to those builders, which will bring up more capital to continue developing some of their existing projects, as well as invest in net new projects for the Forestar program. So, we're still working out the exact capital needs Forestar's going to have and expect to get more of that information back to you in 2018. Mike Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that, obviously looking forward to that. I guess, secondly, you also mentioned that even after the first month or so, that looks like you could exceed some of the projections for Forestar that you originally filed, you had in your June presentation. And looking at that presentation, just for example, if you take like a 2020 snapshot of those slides, where you said for Forestar could have lot deliveries of a little over 7,000 versus maybe around 1,000 in 2018, just trying to get a sense for what that upside might be. You've already noted that - you've provided 15 sourced deals to Forestar, of which, two have already closed. And in the assumptions set on - from the presentation, I think on Slide 10, you said that the assumption there would be 8 projects for Forestar in the first year. So, I assume, obviously, we're not talking about a doubling of the projections but just trying to get a sense perhaps of what the upside might be? Bill Wheat : We're still working with the Forestar guys to figure out exactly what those projections ought to look like. We are optimistic about the numbers we put out in that June deck that we're seeing a greater deal flow that will give us an ability to exceed these numbers. It's hard to sit here today and quantify that exactly, but we are seeing a deal flow that we expect will be greater than what we anticipated for these projections. Doubling, probably a little too aggressive to say that it's going to double at this point, but we're working hard to find every opportunity that makes sense and hits the return hurdles for Forestar. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thank you. Bill Wheat : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next session today is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Market. Your line is now live. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. Jessica Hansen : Good morning. Bill Wheat : Good morning Ken. Ken Zener : So, one of the things that we always talk about is the pace that you talked about your community count. What I'd like to focus on is your units under construction in your 4Q, so your September, and how you've made the choice to not cycle down as much, often as other builders do seasonally, which really gives you just a higher entry point into 2Q. Is there any particular reason - and I think that's what's really different about your business model versus other builders is you do build all this spec. Looking at this year, you're up 13% I believe year-over-year versus last year at 17%, community count seems to be flat in both cases, is there something happening that this year versus last year in terms of construction or your regional mix that's kind of keeping that 26,000 unchanged number at a lower growth rate than you had last year? David Auld : No, Ken, I wouldn't say there's anything different than what we've done. We're just positioning to grow the company. And I do think that you get to a certain size of the - the positioning has to - takes a bit longer, so we purposefully put more inventory out, started more inventory late in the fourth quarter to be positioned for a, what we think is going to be a very good spring selling market. Bill Wheat : And Ken, two years ago, I think we entered fiscal 2016, probably a little lighter than we would've liked to have been in housing inventory, for the market that we saw in front of us. And so, as we grew our year-over-year, year-end inventory position in 2015 to 2016 pretty aggressively, and we're glad we did because we were able to take advantage of that into 2016. The growth from 2016 to 2017 has moderated a little bit from that prior year growth because we were better positioned to start 2016 - we were better positioned, excuse me, to start 2017 than we were 2016. So that gave us less need to add inventory, but we still feel what units we have on hand right now, 26,300, we feel great about that positioning going into 2018. Jessica Hansen : And just for reference, that's our overall housing inventory that's up to 13%. Our spec count is actually at 17% going into the year, which we feel very good about. Ken Zener : Okay. And if I could use that segue to hinge on spring selling, which we approach just seasonally, where over the last few years, your pace, if you look back over the long term, and it appears usually, the pace usually sell at 15% to 18% in the December quarter. But in the last few years, it's been either up or down single-digit, which is a big change and that provides a lot greater pace momentum. Can you talk about what your base outlook is for spring selling; I realize you don't know the exact numbers, but just from the seasonal basis, what do you expect that to be historically? Jessica Hansen : It goes in line with what we're trying to drive from a closings perspective, which is the only number we actually guide to. But if you look at it, generally speaking, we typically see a very sharp increase from December to March, although September to December's relatively flat, slightly up to slightly down. Typically, December to March, we would expect to see, at least, call it, 50% increase in our sales to kind of feel good about where the spring's headed. Mike Murray : A lot of it has to do with how you're positioned, too, where the houses are, what communities, what submarkets. So, I can tell you right now, we feel very good about our position in this year. And I think it's the best we've done positioning for a fiscal year out of the last three. Jessica Hansen : Houses and finished lots. David Auld : Yes. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next session today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Hi thanks, good morning. I was curious about the kind of optioned land market at this point. Not all options I guess are structured the same. So, I guess I'm curious in terms of what are the typical terms you're able to negotiate in today's market, whether it's percentage cash down, takedown commitments, the length of time you are able to get these locked up. Just wondering to kind of how far out on the time horizon you're able to control land in this current environment? Bill Wheat : Buck, that's a deal-by-deal situation. On average, we've got about 5% deposit up for remaining purchase price. Some of the projects we control 18 months, 24 months\u2019 supply, others, we control 3 to 5 years' worth of supply in a given project, and it varies. There are certainly some we put up more than 5%, others less than 5% to arrive at that average. We work very hard at developing those relationships with the developer community. Key business partners for us in all of our markets, our division presidents, our land acquisition professionals work very hard to understand their developers and their market and who they need to partner with to get lots put on the ground and then be a good partner to those developers. Buck Horne : Okay. And just in terms of hard cost, increases or inflation rates, just kind of what are the trends you're seeing in terms of materials, lumber, concrete and the like, in terms of cost increases going into 2018? And also, the labor situation? Any comments you have on skilled-labor availability and wage rates you're seeing into the markets right now? Jessica Hansen : In terms of our cost, Buck, per square foot that we typically talk about, our revenues, once again, outpace our stick-and-brick costs on a year-over-year basis. We did see a slightly higher increase in both our revenues per square foot and our stick-and-brick per square foot in the first three quarters of the year. But that really was just driven by the closings mix shift that Mike mentioned in our scripted comments, because we had a higher percentage of our closings coming from the West. So, I'd say, really, we're just seeing more of the same. If you take out the closings mix, we're seeing a very minor increase in our revenues, just enough to cover our stick-and-brick increase. And then the reason you're not seeing that flow through to an increased gross margin is we continue to have a little bit higher land cost flowing through as well. Buck Horne : Okay. Thanks guys, congrats. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys and congratulations on our really strong quarter and a good end to the year. My first question relates to economies of scale. Certainly, it is apparent from your results over the last few years, if not longer, that there is a substantive difference in terms of how you're able to translate a given level of demand on the ground up to shareholder value. And it seems that there are economies of scale that maybe weren't really fully realized or realizable 10 years ago or 15 years ago. And I was curious if you could just talk about what kinds of things have changed at the corporate level in the way you're managing your business to extract and to drive these economies of scale, and if all of them are the local level or if you've been able to achieve meaningful ones at the national level? David Auld : Steve, during the downturn, we all had to get a lot better and look at everything we were doing and try to figure out how we could do it with a little less people a little more efficiently, and a little better or a lot better. And we - the key operators in this company went through that downturn, very painful experience, don't want to go through it again. So, we strive every day to get a little better in everything we do. And I think that has helped and has created a different operating mindset today than we had in 2006. Mike Murray : And then, Steven, I have to add to that, just kind of overall, part of the ability to approach the business differently does come to our balance sheet structure. And we are operating in a significantly lower leverage level than we did the last time that we were at this scale. And so - and I think that's important. It does reduce our cost structure, it reduces the risk profile significantly. And then our approach to land, we're being more efficient there, moving more towards option and having a lower-risk land strategy but also more efficient higher return strategy that allows us to still generate cash flow, while growing is a significantly different position than we were at the last time that we were at this scale. So, we like our position but we still see, obviously, plenty of opportunities to continue to improve on it from where we are. Stephen Kim : Got it. Okay. Second question is on the M&A landscape. I think you said two things that I found particularly interesting. I think, David, you said that you looked for - you look at acquisitions pretty much the same as you look at a piece of land. And I think you also mentioned that you preferred smaller tuck-in deals. And so, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding those two points. So, one is regarding - looking at acquisitions of a piece of land. Generally speaking, we thought that companies such as yourself typically don't like to pay a lot above book value for the acquisitions you look at. And similar to the way you look at a piece of land, I mean, that's where most of the opportunities, it would seem, arise from is a landholding. So, could you talk about what characteristics in an acquisition would encourage you to pay substantially above book value? And then regarding the smaller tuck-in deals, why smaller ones? Is there something about the difficulty to integrate a large deal that concerns you? Because I would think the competition for the smaller deals would be greater than for the larger deals, particularly, with the Asian companies recently on the hunt, it would seem valuations for the smaller deals are kind of getting pushed up. And so, can you just sort of describe your preference for these smaller deals and what the pipeline looks like compared to last year or the year before? David Auld : I would say that - to start with the end, I'd say the pipeline is probably a little longer today than it was a year ago. And what we're looking for is not necessarily small or big, but - or bigger, but something that is additive to our company, that we can take and grow or integrate some of the things they're doing or the people that they have that make us better. That's - first thing we look at in any acquisition is the culture of the company. And if the culture is not aligned, the people aren't going to be aligned, it's typically not a great deal for us. And the next thing we look about is what kind of premium we got to pay and can we earn that premium back in two years? And if we can't, the deal structure is probably not right for us. We'll let Mike... Mike Murray : With the current platform we have, we're not being - we're not motivated to pay a big premium for anything that we couldn't otherwise do ourselves. As David said before, if it's not something that's going to make our company better, it's probably something that we'd better up spend our time and effort focused in a different area. I mean, I guess the only thing that would motivate us to want to pay a significant premium over book value would be to end my career at Horton. That, that would pretty much do it, I think. Jessica Hansen : We don't see any lack of opportunities to grow our business organically at the pace we want to grow at today. So, it puts us in a very strong position that there's no deal we have to go do to hit our growth targets. Stephen Kim : All right. That's helpful. Just to translate, when you said the pipeline is a longer than it used to be, does that mean that it is more chock-full of acquisitions that are of interest or the opposite? Bill Wheat : No, there are plenty of acquisition opportunities that we're evaluating to determine interest on. I mean - and it's the way it's kind of continued to be for the last several years and it's been - people - the longer the cycle has performed well, the industry has performed well, more and more people have a confidence that they feel like they can price their company comfortable. And a lot of the private builder situations, the principles, the individuals running it day-to-day-to-day are three to five years older today than they were three to five years ago. So, their perspective and outlook potentially may be changing. Stephen Kim : Yeah it is a commonality. All right guys. Thanks very much. Congratulations and thanks very much. Bill Wheat : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : First question, you're looking at your Southeast operations, looks like you did a bit better, certainly than some of the peers who pointed out a lot of disruption with some of the storms. Curious what you attribute that relative outperformance to? David Auld : Great people. Mike Murray : Yes, obviously. That is the platform. It is people. We've got a great position there. There was an impact. There's no doubt there was an impact. There was a disruption from hurricanes. But we've got a lot of hard-working people that worked their way through it. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then, stepping back a bit, you're going to generate a ton of cash. Your land strategy is moving to be more capital-efficient. Kind of call it out that we're not going to see outsized buybacks, at least, in the next couple of years. I'm just curious, how do we think about - or how do you think about return on equity - improving return on equity? You talk about de-leveraging. What am I missing in this cash build and equity build? I mean, I think book value was up 13% to 14% year-over-year. Is there more to squeeze out of operations? Where does the ROE improvement come from with so much cash build? Bill Wheat : There's always room to improve on operations, we'll continue to improve on that. And we are focused on return on equity as well. In order to better - our primary driver right now at return on equity is to continue to drive a stronger ROI. And we do expect to continue to grow revenues faster than our inventory growth to drive that. And then we're at the beginning stages of beginning to repurchase shares that will also provide an element of an improvement to return on equity over time. But we're going to walk before we run.  We're going to begin by taking the steps towards offsetting our dilution. And when we've achieved that, then we'll see where we are, and we'll take the next steps from there. Clearly, we believe that longer term, we have significant cash flow generation opportunities that will give us a lot of flexibility down the line. But for the window that we see in the next two to three years, we believe we're comfortable today stating the loss at dilution, and then we'll take the next steps when we get there. Jessica Hansen : And you'll see in the investor presentation that we're going to post at the end of this call, we actually have added a return on equity slide after our return on inventory, showing that our ROE, while reducing leverage pretty dramatically, has improved from 11.8% in fiscal 2014 to 14.4% in fiscal 2017. So, it's improving along with our ROI while we're de-levering. Bill Wheat : And we do expect it to continue to improve. Jack Micenko : Just one more. Bill, do you have a leverage target? I mean, you got the 2.4, you're going to refinance the $400 million in 2018 you suggested. Is there a leverage ratio that we should think about going out to 2020? Bill Wheat : We have no specific leverage ratio. We expect our leverage ratio to continue to drop from now through 2020. We expect to keep our debt level relatively flat this year by refinancing, but our leverage ratio will drop this year, and then we'd expect that ratio to continue to drop through 2020, while also then increasing our dividends and increasing our share repurchase and growing our business. A balanced approach is really - that's the approach we're taking. David Auld : It's a balanced approach. Jack Micenko : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Dan Oppenheim from UBS. Please proceed with your question. Dan Oppenheim : I was wondering if you can talk a bit more in terms of the success you've had with Express Homes and the Southwest. You're getting back to prior peak volumes, but the Southwest is basically 22% of that prior peak at this point, where we're seeing obviously loan limits being a real challenge in some of those markets. As you think about the gradual easing of credits in FHA and VA loans coming down slightly, relative to where it has been, do you see more potential there in terms of just a greater share of closings coming from there? How are you thinking about that in terms of future investment? David Auld : We think the Phoenix Southwest, which has really driven the Southwest region, is going to continue to outperform. We're incredibly well positioned there, made some very strategic acquisitions on the land lot side a couple of years ago. The operating team out there was kind of reset in conjunction with those, and right now we've got an all-star team running that division with incredibly well-positioned lots. So, our expectation is you're going to see continued growth in the Southwest. And they will get back to their peak at some point. Dan Oppenheim : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to management for any further closing comment. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And a special thank you to the D.R. Horton team in a tough fourth quarter because of weather. You did an outstanding job of delivering the 2017 and even a better job of positioning for 2018. You're the best in the industry, and we thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Please note, that we have changed the presentation of our consolidated [technical difficulty] in development, financial services and other operations on a combined basis. This segment information on a consolidated financials in our press release includes detailed financial information for all of our reporting segments. And as a reminder after this call, we will post updated supplementary data on Investor Relations site, on the presentation side, under news and events for your reference. The supplementary information includes data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now I'll turn the call over to David Auld our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team is off to a strong start in 2018, in the first quarter our consolidated pre-tax income increased 23% to $391.2 million, on a 15% increase in revenue to $3.8 million. Our pre-tax profit margin improves 70 basis points to 11.7% and [technical difficulty] of our homes sold increased 17%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams and the diverse product offerings across our broad national footprint. Our strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual [technical difficulty] in both revenue and pre-tax profits, while generating positive operating cash flows and increasing our returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 17% an improvement of 110 basis points from 15.9% a year ago, with 27,800 homes in inventory at the end of December and 259,000 lots owned and controlled we are well-positioned for spring selling season and further growth in 2018. Mike? Mike Murray : Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 23% to $391.2 million, compared to $318.1 million a year ago and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 27% to $373.8 million compared to [technical difficulty]. Net income for the first quarter was $189.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $206.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law in December impacted our current quarter results with a one-time non-cash charge to income tax expense of $108.7 million to reduce our reduce our deferred tax asset, which was partially offset by $41.1 million redemption in current tax expense due to a lower [technical difficulty] rate, lower federal tax rate apply to this quarter's income. The net impact of the tax legislation was the $67.6 million redemption of net income for the quarter or $0.18 per diluted share. Our backlog conversion rate for the first quarter was 88%. As a result, our first quarter home sales revenues increased 14% to $3.2 billion on 10,788 homes closed, up from $2.8 billion on 9,404 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $295,200, down 1% from the prior year quarter. This quarter actual homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 36% of homes closed and 29% of home sales revenue. Our home [technical difficulty] higher end moved and luxury buyers price greater than $500,000, or 6% of homes closed and 15% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 22 markets across 12 states and customer response to these affordable homes and communities offering a low maintenance lifestyle continue to be positive. Freedom Homes accounted for 2% of homes closed and 1% of home sales revenue in the first quarter. The value of our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 17% from the prior year quarter to $3.2 billion and home sales increased 16% to 10,753 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $299,700, and the 22% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the first quarter of last year. The value of our backlog increased 11% from a year ago to $3.8 billion with an average selling price per home of $306,200 and homes in backlog increased 9% to 12,294 homes. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 20.8%, an improvement of 100 basis points from the prior year quarter and 50 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter. Gross margin increase compared to both periods, primarily due to lower litigation of warranty and interest costs. And I apologize that we're been told that the call is not coming through clearly and it's breaking up. So we're going to very quickly get off the line and redial back in to see if that makes it better. Our apologies for the inconvenience. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Now rejoining our speakers. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin. I'm going to continue with home sales gross margin. Our home sales gross margin will be impacted by the strength of the spring selling season. Based on our first quarter results and current market conditions, we expect our gross margin will be in the range of 20% to 21% for the full fiscal year, with quarterly fluctuations that maybe outside of the range due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranties, litigation and interest costs. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.5%, unchanged from the prior year quarter. This quarter's SG&A includes $5.3 million of transaction cost related to the Forestar acquisition. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $22.2 million, compared to $26.5 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in profit was primarily from lower pricing on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market. 96% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of upward [ph] in home buyers. SHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 43% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior year quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the first quarter with 27,800 homes in inventory; 15,500 of our total homes were unsold, with 11,200 in various stages of construction and 4,300 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 13% more homes in inventory, putting us in a strong position for the spring selling season and the rest of fiscal 2018. David? David Auld : Our homebuilding investment in lots, land and development during the first quarter totaled $954 million, of which $573 million was for finished lots and land acquisitions and $381 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We expect our homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land and development in 2018. Bill? Bill Wheat : At December 31st, our homebuilding, land and lot portfolio consisted of 259,000 lots, of which 126,000 or 49% were owned and 133,000 or 51% were controlled through option contracts. 98,000 of our total homebuilding lots were finished, of which 36,000 were owned and 62,000 were optioned. 3,100 of our optioned lots at December 31st were owned by Forestar. We have increased our option lot position 42% from a year ago and we believe we can increase the option portion of our total land and lot pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with the current level. We plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across the country, as well as growing our majority owned Forestar land development operations. Our 259,000 homebuilding lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and sufficient to support our growth. Mike? Mike Murray : On October 5th, we acquired 75% of the outstanding shares of Forestar Group, a publicly traded residential land development company for $558 million in cash. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country to increase our access to optioned land and lot positions and enhance operational efficiency and returns. The interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar have been very predictive and we continue to be excited about the value this relationship will create over the long-term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. Forestar's operating results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date and as of December 31, 2017 are fully consolidated in our financial segments with the 25% interest D.R. Horton does now reported as non-controlling interest. Forestar's assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, including $402 million of cash, $345 million of land and low inventories and $20 million of goodwill. The segment information tables provided in our press release present Forestar's operating results as of December 31, 2017 on its historical cost basis. And the impact of purchase accounting and other adjustments are presented separately. Forestar currently has operations in 16 markets across 11 states. Both D.R. Horton and Forestar are identifying land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform. Since the acquisition in October, Forestar has been evaluating approximately 22 opportunities, primarily sourced by D.R. Horton and Forestar closed on six of those opportunities as of December 31st. All of the projects are located in high demand markets that D.R. Horton currently serves. These 22 communities are expected to yield approximately 11,000 finished lots majority of which may be sold to D.R. Horton in accords with the master supply agreement between the two companies. We are also continuing to work with Forestar on plans for its existing projects to improve returns and accelerate cash flows on its legacy portfolio, which will provide capitals to support Forestar's future growth. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, during fiscal 2018 we expect Forestar to invest approximately $400 million in land acquisition and development, funded from both existing cash and the cash flow generated from this legacy portfolio. Also in 2018, we expect Forestar to obtain a bank credit facility to help fund its working capital need. In fiscal 2019, we expect Forestar to access the public market for additional growth capital and over the next three years we expect Forestar's annual deliveries to grow to approximately 10,000 lots by fiscal 2020. We do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's fiscal 2018 earnings, primarily due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments and intersegment profit deferrals. We will reference Forestar on a future D.R. Horton earnings calls and we expect to update our 2018 guidance for Forestar on our second quarter call in April. As a public company, Forestar will continue to file quarterly and annual reports and other required public information, but will not host quarterly conference call. D.R. Horton will continue to handle Forestar's Investor Relations to allow the Forestar team to focus solely on operations. Forestar has historically operated on the calendar year-end and will file its 2017 annual report by mid-March. Forestar has announced that it is changing its fiscal year-end from December 31st to September 30th in 2018, which will align with D.R. Horton's fiscal year. Bill? Bill Wheat : At December 31st, our homebuilding liquidity included $558 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $877 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 270 basis points from a year ago to 25.9%. During the quarter, we used $400 million and we issued $400 million of 2.55% senior notes due in 2020 and repaid $400 million of 3.625% senior notes at par. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion and we have no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. During the first quarter, our consolidated cash used in operating activities was $75 million. Excluding Forestar, we used $30.7 million of cash and operations, as we increased our homes under construction in preparation for the spring selling season. During the quarter we paid cash dividends of $47 million to our shareholders and we repurchase 500,000 shares of our common stock for $25.4 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2017 was $174.6 million. At December 31st, our stockholders equity was $7.9 billion and book value per share was $20.98, up 12% from a year ago. We are also pleased that S&P recently upgraded D.R. Horton's investment grade corporate credit rating to BBB flat from BBB minus. David? David Auld : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength, liquidity, consistent earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to improve the long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels, and return capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. After considering the impact of recent tax legislation we now expect to generate at least $700 million of cash from operations in 2018, growing to over $1.25 billion annually in 2020 excluding Forestar. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, we are updating our expectations for 2018 based on current market conditions. We now expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.8% to 12%. We still expect consolidated revenues of between $15.5 billion and $16.3 billion and to close between 50,500 and 52,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margins for fiscal 2018 will be in the range of 20% to 21%, with the potential quarterly fluctuations outside of this range. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be around 8.7%. We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be around 30%. We are forecasting a fiscal 2018 income tax rate of approximately 26% excluding the one-time deferred tax asset charge we took this quarter and we expect our outstanding share account to increase by less than 1% this year. And as David mentioned, we now expect to generate at least $700 million of positive cash flow from operations excluding Forestar in fiscal 2018. Our results this year will be significantly impacted by the strength of the spring selling season and we will update our expectation as necessary each quarter, as visibility to the spring and the full year becomes clear. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate the beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 97% to 100%. We anticipate our second quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 20% to 21% and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be in the range of 9% to 9.2% of homebuilding revenues. Over the longer term and as we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt and decrease our leverage, increase our dividend and repurchase shares to offset dilution with the target to keep our outstanding share count flat by 2020. David? David Auld : In closing, our first quarter's growth in sales, closings and profits is a result of the strength of our people and operating platform. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry leading market share. We remained focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while continuing to generate annual positive operating cash flows and improve returns. We are well positioned to do so, with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offering across our D.R. Horton, Emerald Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work, and we look forward to growing and improving our operations together in 2018, as we celebrate our 40th anniversary year. This concludes the prepared remarks. We will now host any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Good morning everybody. I see Don's still controlling SG&A relative to the phone system. But I wanted to ask a little bit about gross margin, which was better than what we expected and I know we will see the numbers come out a little bit later. But did you have any issues - obviously you have got spec up, but did you have any issues getting homes out of backlog this quarter? And was there any significant mix impact from the higher margin markets that helped you? Mike Murray : No Carl, it was just a solid quarter, backlog conversion was solid, our core margins throughout the business have been very stable. And really our outlook going forward is continuing very stable on a core margin basis. We did see lower impact from litigation and warranty this quarter. I would say back to a more normal level there we've had an elevated level the last several quarters as well as we continue to see a steady decline in the interest component, the interest costs and our margin which was a contribution this quarter as well. But primarily lower litigation warranty and interest and just solid stable margins on a core basis and as we look forward same outlook there. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thanks Bill. And then David, I'm interested in your perspective on some of the markets where you don't have as much penetration. I know we expect you to continue to try to invest to consolidate share in the markets where you've already have presence. But markets like the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic the Midwest can you comment at all about your thought process there, in terms of potential growth in those markets? Thanks. David Auld : Carl we've spend a lot of time last two or three years looking at those markets kind of repositioning within those markets. And my personal belief is that those are going to be a big part of our company kind of going forward. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, David. David Auld : In the markets there are a lot of people there and there is no reason for us not to be number one in those markets, just like we are number one in Texas market. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. The first one is on the comments around the intention for Forestar to access the capital markets in fiscal year 2019. I guess the question would be, any thoughts on whether this is going to be equity or debt? And then is the goal overtime to still kind of dilute that stake down to closer to 25% in accordance with the master supply agreement? Mike Murray : John, this is Mike. We have not yet decided what makes the most sense between debt or equity right now. Possibly a bit of a blend in any as we do intended to drift down our ownership percentage overtime. But today, we're focused first and foremost on building and growing the platform. John Lovallo : Okay, that's helpful. And then, if I heard this correctly, did you guys comment on community count in the quarter being up about 1%. And if that is the case, how comfortable are you with being able to continue to push absorption? Jessica Hansen : Very comfortable with continuing to push absorption that was the story. Obviously once again this quarter we were up 1% year-over-year, sequentially we tick down slightly, I believe about 2%. The details will be at in our supplementary data after the call, but we'd continue to expect our community count to be relatively flat to slightly up or down as we move throughout the year. Mike Murray : And John, our product diversity is really helping drive that absorption as we're introducing Freedom into some of our communities where we have other brands there as well, that's helping us increase our absorption. We really see the potential for that for the remainder of this year. John Lovallo : Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. Stephen East : Thank you. Good morning guys. Just a follow on, on Forestar and surprisingly here, you've identified about 22 deals you brought on about 6. Could you talk about where they're located first of all? And then I have a couple of other questions on Forestar. Mike Murray : Our 22 deals portfolio right now it's the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, Texas and Washington. Stephen East : All right, got you. And then Mike, what's the limiting factor as you move through the year and into fiscal 2019 as far as converting those 22 and whatever else you're seeing converting those to going on to the balance sheet of Forestar? And then could you repeat for me, how many lots you expect to use from Forestar in 2020, I missed that. Mike Murray : In 2020, we expect to have around 10,000 lot deliveries coming out of Forestar. So there is really, the limiting factor is people growing the team and the processes. We feel like we've got adequate capital for the foreseeable future into 2019 before we think about a capital raise, and feeling very good about our growth path and trajectory. The additions to the teams we've made so far have been strong. And we think that's going to lead to more growth in the platform. Stephen East : Okay. And the limiting factor I guess on that growth. And I guess if you're already looking at 11,000 lots to have only 10,000 in 2020, I guess surprises me a little bit. Mike Murray : The 11,000 would be the total inventory in the lots. The 10,000 would be the annual deliveries. So they'll be holding on inventory of several years supply and then - but we expect them to be delivering 10,000 a year out of those deals by 2020 development. Stephen East : Got you, okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning, nice quarter. So first question on the gross margin, really strong results this quarter and you're bumping the low end of the range that you've talked about. It seems like forever, it's at 19 to 21 up 100 basis points. Then the items you mentioned in the release that really drove the upside this quarter, the litigation, the warranty. They're certainly lumpy, but they seem a little bit more one-time in nature, and they can move around a lot. So I was hoping you could just expand a little bit upon like what you're seeing in the market that gives you the confidence to raise that low end? And maybe just expand a little bit on pricing power that you're seeing especially in the face of rising rates that we've seen over the last month or two? Bill Wheat : Yes, Alan we're just seeing really stable strong market out there. Limited inventory, certainly the ability to raise prices obviously in our more affordable product where we're very careful about the pace at which we raise price. Because we want to make sure we can keep an affordable product out there, but the markets very solid, very strong. Certainly we expect to continue to see some cost increases, but our ability to either offset that through other categories or to offset that with some modest price increases we believe is still there. So just overall market tone just feels very stable, very steady, and our outlook for margin is solid for the year. Jessica Hansen : We continue to see our purchasing teams across the country do a fantastic job on controlling costs. We believe our business model plays very nicely into that particularly with Express. But our revenues per square foot did outpace our stick-and-brick increase per square foot on a year-over-year basis again this quarter. So more of the same we're still seeing labor cost pressures and material costs relatively net neutral. Alan Ratner : Great, thanks for that detail. Good to hear. And then the second quarter I know it's really early, but I'm hoping if you could just give some rough parameters here. When you look at the 22 opportunities you're looking at the Forestar and even if you want to drilling more on the 6 that you've closed, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what type of margin underwriting we should think about for Horton as you actually deliver homes on those lots as well as what Forestar will actually report on a development margin when they sell the land to Horton? Just trying to figure out how much different from the 20% to 21% you're talking about. Should we expect on those Forestar deals and what type of margin are you embedding for the developer? Thank you. Mike Murray : We continue to focus on the returns of those projects as we look at it from both the Forestar side and the Horton side. And we're looking at high teens, are very incrementally positive returns to the Forestar portfolio and continuing to underwrite to a 20% or plus return on inventory metric on the home builder side. Those are the primary underwriting metrics that we're looking at. And so that's where we're focusing and the margins will vary. Alan Ratner : Okay, got it. Thanks guys, good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zener : Good morning everybody. David Auld : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zener : So your guidance is up, and the gross margin is good, your orders hit seasonality, my question is relative to your total units in inventory your 27,300 versus 24.5 last year. That low teens growth is good, but I wonder why the spec component - the growth rate in the spec component has declined. Is there something about your orders being stronger in terms of backlog or why did that component of units in inventory declined year-over-year when that's obviously a component that enables you to gain share by building spec ahead of other builders? Jessica Hansen : Our spec count is actually up 16% year-over-year Ken, I don't know if that's part of what was cutting out on our call, we do apologize for the in and out earlier. Ken Zener : Okay. So what is your total units in inventory 27.3 and what's your spec count? Jessica Hansen : Our total units in inventory is 27,800 and our spec count is about 15,500. Ken Zener : Okay. And is that the gross margin guidance there, I know you're obviously working on a lot of different things, but you were the first company really to cut gross margins in order to get the pace up. Is there something that you're doing to get this slight upward revision in gross margins, I mean, is it if labor is there, material is there why are you getting this upward tick? Could you readdress that? Thank you. David Auld : We've been working very, very hard to improve efficiency deliveries in the delivery of the product, take labor out of it. If you look at our ASP on closed houses we actually saw a slight dip this last quarter, while we improved margins. And that's just the combination of a lot of really hard work in getting product positioned to be more competitive and drive a better return and - which is now translating into - it has been stable margins, but we saw a little uptick this last quarter. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Mike Rehaut : Thanks, good morning everyone. First question, I just wanted to make sure I got the best feel for it and I apologize if you answered this earlier might have been when you were little more statically. But the drivers of the gross margin increase for fiscal 2018 you highlighted that the kind of the upside or the higher end of the range in the first quarter was due to the litigation warranty also a little bit of less interest cost and that that has become more stable than previous years. So am I to infer then that the raise for the full year is also driven by these two factors primarily and obviously continue that good end markets and being able to roughly offset costs inflation, which are all very good positives. But that the lower litigation warranty and perhaps the less interest as a percent of revenue, those are that the main drivers of the increase for the full year? Mike Murray : Yes, Mike that is the primary driver, I would say it's the reason why we haven't been able to raise our margin guidance prior to this. We were seeing a trend that was affecting our margin, that trend has moderated. We believe it's at a more stable level today and we continue to see a very stable outlook in the core of our business. Mike Rehaut : Right, okay great. No, that's helpful. And also then on Forestar, with the 10,000 deliveries that you expect the company to achieve in 2020, I guess, that's a year ahead of the original slideshow presentation and expectations, also you have now you talked about 22 deals of that are being evaluated, six have already closed. And I believe in the original guidance, you were looking for eight deals to be close in the first year. So, is this - are we to kind of conclude that maybe would Forestar would be doing perhaps in the 10,000 to 15,000 range in the first year and that kind of as you look at further years out, if it's 10,000 in 2020, the 15,000 goal that you had I believe in 2022 could be something on the order of a 20 to 25 type number? Bill Wheat : I think we indicated last quarter we thought that we would be able to exceed those June projections, that were out there and we try to update that a bit right now with the 2020 goal of 10,000 deliveries. And very pleased with the flow of projects and opportunities that Forestar has been able to evaluate. But we will be updating our guidance for the balance of 2018, with some more details in April. We'll be a little more comfortable I think to share a little more granularity in what we see in interim periods. Mike Rehaut : Okay. And just one last quick one if I could, the operating margin guidance being raised by 30 bps versus the gross margin guidance raised by 50 bps. What's the reconciliation there? Jessica Hansen : We reduced our financial services operating margin, we have set 30% to 32%, now we're saying around 30%. The operating margin was only about 27.5% in the first quarter and we are seeing competitive pressures in the mortgage market, it's really reverting to what we would consider to be a normalized operating margin, whereas the last of couple of years they have seen outsized margins in their business. Mike Rehaut : Okay, perfect. Yes, I was thinking operating homebuilding margin. So thanks for that clarification. Jessica Hansen : Yes, [indiscernible] consolidated pre-tax margin of 11.8% to 12%. Mike Rehaut : Got it, thanks a lot. Jessica Hansen : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : Thanks a lot guys, really impressive results. My first question relates to the comment you made David, about the importance of discipline and I think that's something that really has been a focus I know of yours in the company and in the management team over the last few years. With respect to discipline, we were looking at your ROA across your regions recently and I was kind of surprised to see just how wide the spread of returns on assets were across your different reporting regions, it was actually among the widest we have seen - we see in the group. And I was curious, if you just sort of comment on the degree - why we are not seeing the discipline and the controls and the overall strength of Horton not also manifest itself in perhaps somewhat more similar returns across the regions, if that's even a meaningful metric or goal or aspiration at all and if not, why not? David Auld : Every one of these markets are different and we do operate with a very decentralized approach to what we're doing we think that gives us that ability to scale up and operate in markets profitably other people have a difficult time entering. When I look at these operations and like the Northeast or Arizona a couple of years ago, actually opportunities get better and that's what we're striving to do is overtime get better. If you look at the longevity of our people you see that we've - I think in a way lead the industry and been able to keep people in markets for the longest period of time that's very important to me. So we don't have a top down approach to it, we don't have a quick trigger on changing people out. We work with people striving to get better and build on their relationships within those markets to create long-term value for the shareholders. And that's been the philosophy of Don Horton, Donald and something I shared. Stephen Kim : Great. I appreciate that, thanks. If I could extend the question again a little bit in a slightly different way talking about discipline. We've also been very intrigued to note that this cycle is the first housing up cycle where we've seen eight consecutive years of housing start increases. That's never happened in the history of the country. So while housing may still be as cyclical as it ever was, it has been noticeably less volatile than in prior cycles. And I was curious if you could talk about if you think housing demand is more likely it's likely become more volatile in the next couple of years in a potentially rising rate environment. And how you think D.R. Horton's discipline in the market particularly maybe with respect to your spec strategy and incentives? How that might be more visible or visible in a more volatile market if we were to have one? Bill Wheat : Steve, we've been expecting to see higher interest rates for a quite few years. We feel that's very important to maintain an affordable product out there in any environment. And that's really still the most underserved segment of the market today is at the affordable end of the price range. So as we go into a period where we're now interest rates are rising, we believe we're in a very good position to compete in that scenario. Our decentralized operations also allow us to respond to individual market trends when changes in local economies affect the housing market. But overall, we're very pleased with the position that we're in. Mike Murray : And also look at the recovery. It has been eight years of increasing housing starts, but they're increasing from a very low level at a very slow trajectory relative to continued population growth household formations. So the under building so to speak, that was occurring. We're still working out against that. And there has been discipline in the industry with amongst the players and not being overbuilt. David Auld : I think, the other contributing factor to what has extended this housing cycle has been the lack of financing for small builders and independent developers. That typically that's how the market gets oversupplied. Lawyers become developers and doctors become lawyers and it's a - they put product out there that there is no demand for. And what's you're not seeing and it's not just the D.R. Horton it's all the builders. Much more disciplined, we all went through that downturn. And we didn't enjoy. So we've got a great market working for us today. And it's just a matter of positioning and execution. And we did pretty well in that environment. Stephen Kim : Great, thanks a lot guys and best of luck. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from Susquehanna. Your line is now live. Soham Bhonsle : Hey, good morning guys. This is Soham on for Jack today. My first question was on capital allocation. And just coming back to what you guys said in your opening comments on priorities going forward in the other of paying down debt, raising dividend and purchasing shares to offset dilution. Just curious you mentioned raising dividends. So just wondering, what's driving the decision to favoring a dividend increase over share repurchase at this time? Bill Wheat : We've always been a steady dividend payer. That has typically been our preferred method of distribution to shareholders through the years and it continues to be. We have more recently begun to pull then some level of repurchases of shares and we expect that to now become part of our consistent distributions as well. But that's really been the - our historical pattern on distributions to shareholders through dividends. Mike Murray : We went from no share repurchases in the year ago quarter to up to 0.5 million shares repurchased in the most recent quarter. So seeing an increase in return there and our focus would also be looking for opportunities to invest in the business and continue to take advantage of market opportunities that we see, as a high priority for our capital. Soham Bhonsle : Okay. And then I guess one Forestar, as we think about gross margins and SG&A for that business. Is 40% on the gross margin the right level to think about? And then what is the SG&A percentage look like on the 10,000 lot basis that you guys just referred too? Just trying to think through the longer-term pre-tax profile for the business? Bill Wheat : Right, we're focused like we are at the homebuilder, we're focused on the returns and the Forestar team is focused on the returns as the primary metrics that are guiding their decisions. And we'll get back with some more updated guidance information after Forestar reports their full annual results in mid-March when we come back with our April call. Soham Bhonsle : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. First, thinking about the 60% optioned lot target which you folks have mentioned again here and I think you have been talking about that pretty consistently. How do we think about the increment from here at 50% to 60% relative to Forestar? The 10,000 lot deliveries by 2020 would seem to make up - would seem to help make up most of that progress from 50% to 60%. Is that roughly where that difference is going to come from? Or am I not thinking about that credit because of the consolidation of Forestar? Mike Murray : I think you are going see it coming from both sources the third-party land developers as well as Forestar. The exact mix between those two still kind of working that out, but I do feel really good that both - we'll have both the expanded relationships with developers as well as certainly an increased supply from Forestar for our lot position. Nishu Sood : Got it, thanks. And in terms of mortgage rates obviously some concern about those having picked up. Now you folks have been pretty consistent in describing that if rates are rising relative to a better growth pattern that's fine. But if there is a sharp move, continued sharp move in rates during the spring selling season, what level on the third year would worry you, is it the 4.5%, 5% how are you thinking about that heading into the spring selling season? Jessica Hansen : There is no certain rate really an issue as you said it really is based on how sharp they rise. So if they do rise very sharply in a short period of time, we would expect some period of impact, while buyers' mindset resets and adjust to that higher rate. But as long as we're offering affordable homes that people can afford, which we think we are doing today even with a decent rising rates. We feel good about the overall spring selling season in really sales as we move throughout 2018. David Auld : With the increase in rents that we've seen in the market, the payment at 4% or 4.5% is even close to 5%, still going to be less than rent amounts. So it's - these are great rates. And what we have seen is that the uncertainty in rates is pushing people off the accounts [ph], and is actually increasing demand right now. So, we're looking at each market individually and positioning within that market to meet our targets, feel pretty good about it. Nishu Sood : Got it, thanks for the color. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Michael Dahl : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First question, just another high level question around how to think about the impact of Forestar and I guess if we're thinking about these 10,000 lots or as you go up further clearly more. But these are deals that buy and large would have otherwise been either been either sourced to other third party partners or brought on your own books if I'm - or A, would be am I thinking about that correctly; and then B, if so is it then more of an issue from an accounting standpoint of you'll capture the additional margin on having developed those lots through Forestar versus outsourcing them to total third party? Or is it truly a - so is it a margin gain or is it a -line gain in your view as far as the contributions from Forestar? Mike Murray : Well the goal of Forestar is for them to be a large well capitalized national land developer that ultimately will not be on our balance sheet. And so while we're in the process of doing right now is putting deals in place to build a pipeline just help them build that foundation and build that platform across the country. Ultimately what that will provide when they are capitalized, when the foundation is built, when they're across the country and they're off our balance sheet the returns on D.R. Horton side will grow because we will have a more efficient balance sheet. There are profits to be made in the land development business and Forestar will make a solid profit, a solid return on the investments that they are making. And we will earn our portion of the profits on the Forestar business. But in the short run here for the next year or two we are in the process of building out that platform and putting them in position to deliver a more substantial portion of our lots down the line and to build a profitable strong returning business on a standalone basis. Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay, thanks. And the second question, I guess, if you could just I know it's still a small piece of the business, but in the midst of a meaningful ramp over the course of this year and next before looking at Freedom homes. Could you give us an update on how we should be thinking about that ramp over the course of 2018 and any details you can give us on what type of sales pace you're observing in those communities relative to your other brands? David Auld : We've pushed this into 22 markets we're actively working on every market we've got introducing the Freedom, it's a little bit different in that set up on the community HOA documents are a little more restricted than what typically be a Horton community. So it has been a situation where we are having to put lots on the ground to support that brand. It's a huge buyer segment, buyer demographic and they are much less interest rate sensitive. So we think it's going to be a significant impact to growth if not this year next year then certainly three to five year period. Mike Murray : Steady growth is the expectation within a few quarters it's at now 2% of our overall mix, we would expect to see steady growth going forward throughout 2018 and 2019. Michael Dahl : Okay, thank you. David Auld : Where we can put those projects on the ground and execute it well. They have outperformed and very excited about it. Michael Dahl : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Oppenheim from UBS. Your line is now live. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. I was wondering about the issues the specs and the rate environment here. Wondering what you're seeing in terms of the consumer respond are you seeing that this period of where mortgage rates is actually increasing the attractiveness of specs with the sorter closing time? And also wondering as others talked about spec in terms of just the potential for lower margins are you seeing that or are you seeing that the specs are coming through essentially the same margins as to be built on? Mike Murray : Specs have consistently been a significant part of our business operations and those margins that we see now reflects 70% to 80% spec home deliveries every quarter and have for a long-long time. So we're not seeing anything, but solid margin performance across our communities and that's reflective of a lot of spec deliveries, which is very helpful as we compete with not just other new home sales, but with existing home sales as well. David Auld : Our operators are very disciplined. We're not just throwing inventory out there we plan our spec starts based upon demand within that community and position it to create a most efficiency we can building these houses through the - on a month-to-month week-to-week basis, which is part of our overall program. And I believe, we believe that it is the reason we've been able to maintain such stable margins for the past three, four years. Jessica Hansen : And Dan, in terms of the rate environment we haven't seen any impact to our traffic or sales in January as a result of mortgage rates, actually very pleased with our sales pace and in line with our business plan as we're finishing out the month here today. Dan Oppenheim : Jessica I specially meant more in terms of just does the - do the specs actually service incentive and help the conversion rate of traffic people can then close in? David Auld : Absolutely. Dan Oppenheim : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Please proceed with your question. Jade Rahmani : Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could give your updated thoughts around integrated off-site solutions in terms of preconstruction of various aspects of the home. How much potential do you see in this trend over several years? Mike Murray : We continue to look at different ways to be more efficient in the building process and we in various markets and we do penalization, in other markets it's more restrictable process and in a lot of places it's a combination of both on-site always looking for the most efficient way to deliver affordable home. But we continue to watch that and at this time, we don't really have any kind of a codified view on what impact that will have on the awarding, but with something rest assure that we're watching continually. Jade Rahmani : And can you also comment on labor availability and cost pressures, related to labor constraints. How are you managing that and where would you say the problems are most acute? Mike Murray : The problem really hasn't manifested itself for us, broadly across the board we - our spec strategy, our disciplined starting program of working to give an absorption in the community has allowed us to get the labor we need. From a high-level monitor overall build to see if we are having issues delivering homes and we've not seen any kind of elongation in our build cycle by our field production teams. They have done a great job staying on top of the labor. And then with the cost we have seen some increases in stick-and-brick cost that it varies from quarter-to-quarter is to how it's manifesting itself. But for the most part we have been able to get the pricing power to cover any of the cost increases that have come through. Jade Rahmani : Thanks very much. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Thanks, good morning. I had a question on labor, but that get answered as well. So I'll ask a question that I get a lot from my clients. Just about the tax law changes and how you guys might internally be thinking about, if these changes the standard deductions, state and local taxes and mortgage interest deductibility. Do you think that has any meaningful effect on buyer behavior, maybe between certain states this year or even next? Mike Murray : Buck with the homes we're looking to deliver primarily affordable homes that whatever customer segment we're serving. We are not expecting a significant negative impacted at all from the tax rate changes. In fact we're hopeful it put more money in people's pockets that they are more emboldened to be confident to make the decision to go and buy that new home and to buy an affordable home from D.R. Horton. David Auld : Buck the alternative is rents and if you want to lock in your housing costs, you pretty much got home and build equity [ph] all the time. So it's a strong economy, more money in their pockets those are both ramps for D.R. Horton. Buck Horne : Okay, thank you. And just a quick follow-up, have you guys given any thought to partnering or working with other single family rental operators for product that may be built for rent if that type of opportunity presented itself? David Auld : We get pitched a lot of things from a lot of different people. Right now we are very happy with the absorptions we're driving selling to single family homeowners. And to me you put too many renters in a community owned by one company you can end up creating problems for the homeowners. So, if that was a way to drive absorption and we were looking to drive absorption then we probably we think more about it. But right now today we like the model we work under and feel like we are offering long-term value to our homeowners and that's a winning combination for us. Buck Horne : Thanks, that's very helpful, I appreciate it. Great quarter guys, thank you. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April, to share our second quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, thank you for a strong first quarter and an outstanding start to 2018. We are proud to represent you up here. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good morning and welcome to the D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States, second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Donna, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website in investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q by early next week. Consistent with the first quarter, our consolidated financials present our homebuilding, Forestar land development, financial services, and other operations on a combined basis. The segment information following the consolidated financials in our press release includes detailed financial information for all of our reporting segments. And as a reminder, after this call we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix, and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid second quarter and the spring selling season is off to a strong start, with our sales increasing 13% from the prior year. In the second quarter, our consolidated pre-tax increased 26% to $445 million on a 17% increase in revenues to $3.8 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 80 basis points to 11.7%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our diverse product offerings, and the leverage of both our national and local scale across our broad geographic footprint. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while increasing our annual operating cash flows and returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 17.6%, an improvement of 160 basis points from 16% a year ago. With 29,400 homes in inventory at the end of March and 258,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2018 and future years. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the second quarter increased 53% to $351 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $229 million or $0.60 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Our effective tax rates for the quarter and year to date reflect the rate reduction from the Tax Act of 2017, an excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, and the February Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which retroactively reinstated the federal tax credit for energy-efficient homes. The current year's six-month period also includes a one-time non-cash tax charge of $108.7 million to remeasure the company's net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 26% to $445 million versus $354 million a year ago, and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 29% to $416 million compared to $322 million. Our current quarter results include $30.1 million of pre-tax inventory and land option charges to cost of sales, of which $24.5 million relates to the settlement of an outstanding dispute associated with a land transaction. Our backlog conversion rate for the second quarter was 100%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a result, our second quarter home sales revenues increased 16% to $3.7 billion on 12,281 homes closed, up from $3.2 billion on 10,685 homes closed in the prior-year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $299,000, up 1% from the prior-year quarter. This quarter, entry level homes marketed under our Express Homes brand accounted for 38% of homes closed and 30% of home sales revenue. Our homes for higher-end, move-up, and luxury buyers priced greater than $500,000 were 6% of homes closed and 15% of home sales revenue. Our active adult Freedom Homes brand is now being offered in 25 markets across 14 states and accounted for 2% of homes closed and 1.5% of home sales revenue in the second quarter. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The value of our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 13% from the prior-year quarter to $4.7 billion, and homes sold increased 13% to 15,828 homes. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 1% from the prior-year quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,600. And the 19% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the second quarter of last year. The value of our backlog increased 9% from a year ago to $4.8 billion, with an average sales price per home of $305,100 and homes in backlog increased 8% to 15,841 homes. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 20.8%, consistent with the first quarter and an improvement of 100 basis points from the prior-year quarter. 60 basis points of the improvement from the prior-year quarter was due to lower interest, litigation, and warranty costs, and 40 basis points was due to controlling construction cost increases while also reducing incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted absorption. Based on current market conditions and our results for the first half of the year, we now expect our gross margin will be in the range of 20.5% to 21% for the full fiscal year, with quarterly fluctuations that may be outside of the range due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation, and interest costs. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.8%, an improvement of 50 basis points from the prior-year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our expected growth. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $31.4 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 33% compared to $32.2 million of pre-tax income and a 37% pre-tax profit margin in the prior-year quarter. Financial services profit margin declined this quarter primarily from lower pricing on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market. 97% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 57% of D.R. Horton home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 722 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 45% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, consistent with the prior-year quarter. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We ended the second quarter with 29,400 homes in inventory. 14,200 of our total homes were unsold with 10,400 homes in various stages of construction and 3,800 homes completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 8% more homes in inventory, which positions us well for the remainder of the spring selling season in fiscal 2018. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our homebuilding investment in lots, land, and development during the second quarter totaled $862 million, of which $504 million was for finished lots and land acquisition and $358 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. We expect our homebuilding operations to invest approximately $4 billion in lots, land, and development in 2018. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At March 31, our homebuilding land and lot portfolio consisted of 258,000 lots, of which 124,000 lots or 48% were owned and 134,000 lots or 52% were controlled through option contracts. 103,000 of our total homebuilding lots were finished, of which 35,000 lots were owned and 68,000 lots were optioned. 8,700 of our optioned lots at March 31 were owned or controlled by Forestar. We have increased our option lot position 23% from a year ago, and we believe we can increase the option portion of our total planned and lot pipeline to 60% over the next few years, while keeping our number of owned lots near the current level. We plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across the country, as well as growing our majority-owned Forestar land development operations. Our 258,000 homebuilding lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and sufficient to support our expected growth. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: As most of you know, Forestar Group became a majority-owned subsidiary of D.R. Horton in October 2017. Forestar is a publicly-traded land development company with operations in 18 markets and 10 states. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar advances our strategy of expanding relationships with land developers across the country to increase our access to option land and lot positions and enhance operational efficiency and returns. The interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar continue to be extremely productive, and we're excited about the value this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. Forestar's operating results for the three-month period ended March 31, and from the date of acquisition are fully consolidated in our financial statements, with the 25% interest D.R. Horton does not own reported as noncontrolling interest. The segment information tables provided in our press release present Forestar's financials on its historical cost basis, while the impact of purchase accounting and interest segment profit eliminations are presented separately. During the quarter, Forestar sold a portion of its assets for $232 million. This strategic asset sale included projects owned both directly and indirectly through joint ventures and consisted of approximately 750 developed and under development lots, 4,000 undeveloped lots, 730 unentitled acres, a multi-family development site, and an interest in one multi-family property. This sale provided capital for future growth while also streamlining Forestar's operations. Both D.R. Horton and Forestar continue to identify land development opportunities to expand Forestar's platform. Since the acquisition closed in October, Forestar has been evaluating 38 opportunities primarily sourced by D.R. Horton and Forestar had closed on 21 of those opportunities as of March 31. All of the projects are located in high-demand markets that D.R. Horton currently serves. These 38 communities are expected to yield approximately 15,000 finished lots, the majority of which may be sold to D.R. Horton in accordance with the master supply agreement between the two companies. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Looking forward, we continue to expect Forestar to invest approximately $400 million in land acquisition and development this year, and to obtain a bank credit facility by the end of this fiscal year to help fund its working capital needs. In fiscal 2018 we also expect Forestar to deliver approximately 1200 lots and generate $90 million in revenue. In fiscal 2019 we expect Forestar to deliver approximately 4,000 lots, generate $300 million to $350 million in revenue, and access the public markets for additional growth capital as conditions permit. In fiscal 2020 we expect Forestar to deliver approximately 10,000 lots and generate $700 million to $800 million in revenue. Over the next three years we anticipate Forestar's stabilized pre-tax operating margins will be in the range of 10% to 12%, and Forestar is targeting a net debt to capital ratio of 40%. The expectations I just outlined are for Forestar's standalone results. Due to the impact of inter-segment profit eliminations we do not expect Forestar to have a material impact on D.R. Horton's fiscal 2018 earnings. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At March 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $529 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 380 basis points from a year ago to 24.2%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion, and we have $500 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, our homebuilding segment generated $90.7 million of operating cash flows and our consolidated cash used in operations was $98.8 billion. Excluding Forestar, we generated $59.5 million of cash from operations for the current year six month period. During the quarter we paid cash dividends of $47.1 million and we repurchased 500,000 shares of our common stock for $22.5 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at March 31, 2018 was $152.1 million. At March 31 our stockholders equity was $8.2 billion and book value per share was $21.72, up 13% from a year ago. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce or maintain debt levels and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. After increasing our guidance for pre-tax profit margin in our press release this morning, excluding Forestar, we now expect to generate at least $800 million of cash from operations in 2018 growing to over $1.25 billion annually in 2020. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Looking forward, and as outlined in our press release this morning, we are updating our expectations for 2018 based on current market conditions and our results for the first half of the year. We now expect to generate a consolidated pre-tax margin of 12.1% to 12.3%. We expect consolidated revenues of between $15.9 billion and $16.3 billion, and to close between 51,500 and 52,500 homes. We anticipate our home sales gross margin for fiscal 2018 will be in the range of 20.5% to 21% with the potential for quarterly fluctuations outside of this range. We estimate our annual homebuilding SG&A expense will be around 8.7%. We expect our financial services operating margin for the year to be around 30%. We are now forecasting a fiscal 2018 income tax rate of approximately 25%, excluding the one-time deferred tax asset charge we took in the first quarter, and we expect our outstanding share count to increase by less than 1% in fiscal 2018. And as David just mentioned, we now expect to generate at least $800 million of positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2018, excluding Forestar. For the third quarter of 2018 we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in the range of 87% to 89%. We anticipate our third quarter home sales gross margin will be in the range of 20.5% to 21%, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be in the range of 8.2% to 8.3% of homebuilding revenues. We expect our income tax rate in both the third and fourth quarters to be between 25% and 26%. Over the longer term and as we generate increased cash flows, we expect to pay down debt and decrease our leverage, increase our dividend, and repurchase shares to offset dilution with the target to keep our outstanding share count flat by 2020. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: To conclude and reiterate, our growth in sales, closings, profits, returns and cash flow is a result of the strength of our long-tenured people and well-established operating platforms across the country. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to continue to expand our industry-leading market share. We remain focused on growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while increasing our annual operating cash flows and improving returns in our business and to our shareholders. We are well-positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express, and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land positions, and most importantly our outstanding team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work. We look forward to growing and improving our operations during our 40th anniversary year, while preparing for great opportunities in the years to come. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question is coming from John Lovallo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. First question is Forestar's stock has held up really well, particularly relative to the group. And frankly, most of the investors that we speak with are aware and really very much on board with the asset-light thesis and the strategy to issue equity to not only fund the business, but dilute your stake down. I guess the question is why not do this sooner than later. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: John, thank you for the question. I think what we're focused on at Forestar first and foremost is building a great operational platform. When we bought the company in October, just about a little over six months ago, they had not really been focused on driving a community development business in the way we need it built. And so first things first is realigning the team and the people that are in place there, building the interactions between D.R. Horton and Forestar, and building a strong operating platform. We think that, building for the long term, will help any capital raises when we go to the markets next year. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And, John, fortunately, they started with a lot of cash. And so they had $400 million of cash at the date of the transaction, so from the standpoint of need for capital to fund that growth, it wasn't an immediate need. They were also able to generate cash by selling some of their legacy portfolio as well. And so we believe that focusing on operations, putting them in place to support us for the long term, which is really what will drive long-term value, is most important. And certainly then, capital raises, both equity and debt down the line from Forestar, will be an important part of their strategy, but it was not necessary here in this first year. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That makes sense, okay. And then clearly, there's a lot of concern in the market about interest rates and about construction costs. Your orders and margins should help ease some of those concerns there. But are you guys seeing in the field any caution from potential buyers on rates? And maybe if you could, just update us on what your stick-and-brick costs are running year over year, please. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're actually seeing more buyers come in and better qualified buyers today. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, our FICO score this quarter was 722, which is the highest it's been in several years, and that's with Express continuing to become a bigger piece of our business. So we're really not seeing rates have any noticeable impact on demand. And for us, it's all about jobs and affordability. So as long as those two things are good, we don't expect an impact on demand even if rates do continue to rise gradually as we move throughout the year, which I think is our expectation today. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The question about costs, John, our stick-and-brick cost per square foot was up low single digits. Our lot cost per square foot was up mid-single digit, and then clearly our revenue per square foot was enough to offset that, so the steady and improving year-over-year margin. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So really more of the same in terms of revenues outpacing stick-and-brick costs. Our guys have done a phenomenal job controlling cost increases in a rising cost environment, and we've been able to offset it with price. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And, John, it's David. I would say the optimism that's out there in the market today, the slight increase in rates that we've seen are really fueling demand. And if rates just continue to move slowly, I see a long, sustained housing market. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very encouraging, guys. Thanks for the time. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen East of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just following on Forestar a little bit, Mike, maybe you could give us an update on the buildout for Forestar, what you all are doing, so eventually this becomes the standalone operation other than Horton sourcing everything. And when would you expect to start to see that occur, where they are sourcing more than what Horton is bringing to the table? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Where they are sourcing more than what Horton's bringing to the table, that will be probably at some point down the road. One of the things we talked about last summer when we were working on this and explaining our strategy was that we have hundreds of people across the country today that are out. Their whole focus is to identify new land and community opportunities, And Forestar still has I think 35 to 40 people on the team. And while there have been some new folks added, and I think we will continue to see a team built out over the next 12 to 18 to 24 months, it's going to be a bit of time before they're able to source as many deals as we're able to source and provide opportunities for them to evaluate. So I don't see that in the near term. In the medium to long term, certainly that is a key goal for them to be able to be sustainable and independent of us in terms of their own lot supply and pipeline. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: This is David. We had the Forestar guys up yesterday, day before, just going over operational plans. And I think their primary focus, their internal goals, are to create independence from Horton. And they are looking at deals today that will be sourced directly by them, but they've got to have people. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The thing that makes us different is people, and they got to do that. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think in the past 90 days they've closed on two deals that were independently sourced. One had been in their process for quite a while. One was a more recent opportunity that presented itself they were able to take advantage of. So they are out, they are actively working it. It's just in this business it's a very large funnel where you start with the lot and you work it down over a period of time to get there. So the larger your starting number is, the more likely you're going to be able to close some of that. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And an important part of putting them in position to be able to do that down the line is expanding their platform across the Horton footprint, leveraging the Horton structure today to give them a presence in more markets than they're in today, and then that will then put them in position to source more land independently down the line. But fortunately, we've got the opportunity for them to show tremendous growth just to grow their operations by leveraging Horton in the short term. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, and one follow-up on that. Would that mean would rollups play a significant part in that? And then my other question just revolves around cash flow. As you look out, when would you start seeing your cash flow get better because of Forestar's activities? I didn't really hear any commentary about actively looking on the M&A side. Is that going to play into it also? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So on the rollup opportunities within Forestar, that is something that certainly we'll be evaluating as they're looking to build the team. And with that \u2013 like on the builder side, we'll be very opportunistic. We continue to look at various M&A opportunities on the builder side, opportunistically where it makes sense to add people to the team, potentially new products and new markets. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And our D.R. Horton cash flow guidance already includes what we expect as a result of Forestar and moving to 60% options here over the next few years and growing that cash flow number to over $1.25 billion annually by 2020. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner of Zelman and Associates. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: So a question on price point. Obviously, you guys have been an early mover at the entry level. We heard another builder yesterday who's more of a move-up builder just actually mention the fact that they're seeing less competition now as other builders have kind of moved into your space on the entry level side. And I remember last quarter; I think it was, you actually highlighted at some point maybe an opportunity might present itself to get more active at move-ups. So was curious if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics you're seeing across your portfolio? Do you still feel like entry level is a space that has a lot of runway to go based on the new entrants into that arena? And are you starting to see more opportunities unfold in move-up given I guess some builders leaving that space? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, we haven't really seen anybody leave that space. But I can tell you the entry level demographics and really the delay in what used to be the 25s buying houses to 35s, that group of people is, there's more demand than is currently being serviced. So we're focused on returns. The entry level is driving the best returns. I think as time moves, we will see that shift up the price curve. But right now today, it's awfully good in that $250,000 to $300,000 range. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it, great. Okay, good to hear. And then second question, if I look at your order growth, it was remarkably consistent across the regions, but just curious if you could talk a little bit about which markets you're seeing maybe the strongest pricing power relative to cost inflation and where you're seeing the best opportunity to drive growth going forward? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Texas, Florida continue be very, very strong markets. Arizona has come on incredibly strong for us over the last couple of years. There's a lot of stability in California at the price points we're selling. Northwest continues to be very, very strong and we're getting a little better in the Northeast. So we like to see that consistency. That's something we strive for, and really pretty proud of what our people are doing out there. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And then you see our supplemental data here in a little while, Alan. After the call, you'll see that really, our absorptions were up strongly across the board in all of our regions. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Any markets that jump out on the other side where maybe pricing's seeing a bit of a wall or absorption growth is a little more challenging? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I got to tell you, we're not seeing that right now, even what has been our weaker markets have stabilized, and we're seeing, if not significant absorption gains, we're seeing margin moving up a little bit. So the market is very good right now. There're a lot of people out there that don't own a house that want to figure out how to get in one, and they feel good enough to take the risk, to sign a mortgage and close. So job growth is strong. Consumer optimism is way up. Consumer confidence is way up; a lot of good things happening in the country right now. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Great. Good to hear. Good luck, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt of BTIG. Please go ahead. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about... Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning, Carl. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Good morning. I wanted to ask about flight count, which I think was flat or a little bit down. When do you expect that you might see a \u2013 sort of a reacceleration in the growth in number of communities year on year, especially given that the lot count is kind of building now behind the store count? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Carl, we do still expect to see growth over time in our community count. We've seen periods where we're slightly up. This quarter we were down 1% year-over-year. Over the medium to longer term, we expect to see modest growth there. Predicting exactly when that inflection point hits by quarter is a little bit difficult for us, but we've been seeing continued improving absorptions as we continue to improve our execution, and how we're meeting the markets across our markets. And that's been able to drive steady double-digit growth now for several years with very modest community count growth. But we do expect that to inflect, but predicting exactly when, it's a little bit hard. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Okay. Thanks, Bill. And then wanted to ask about co-broke costs, I know for a long time, you've looked at buyers brokers as a really important set of partners for you, and you've worked with them closely over a long period of time. How are you thinking about those relationships on sort of a longer-term basis? Are those kinds of costs that you have to payout something that you could work to lower over time? I'm just kind of interested in how you think about that sort of strategically and tactically? Thanks. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Strategically, we think of them as partners, and we're going to continue to work with that community at a level that really is unique in the industry. Now, over time, will their economics change? Will they have to become more efficient and more competitive? Yes, but at least in my mind, they're going to be \u2013 the resale market is so much bigger than the new home market, and whether it's online, whether it's some other type, that inter-reaction with people at point of sale I think is still going to be a part of how you get a transaction closed. So we love realtors. We're going to continue to support realtors. And to me, they're as big a part of the cost of the house, as a necessary part of the house as concrete and lumber, because they drive the industry. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and nice results. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, I wanted to go back to the shift to lot optioning and obviously, you've had a lot of success there. And with the most recent \u2013 this most recent quarter at 52%, you continue to make a very consistent, solid move towards that 60%. If you extrapolate 2% a quarter and not that one quarter is indicative of a trend, it could suggest that maybe you're going to get to that 60% not in a couple of years, but perhaps on a shorter timeframe. I was curious if that's a possibility to get to a 60% type of mark over the next 12 to 18 months instead of the next two to three years, and what might impact \u2013 and what impact that might have from a return perspective, return on equity, return on capital. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Michael, that has been a consistent driver of our improving returns on our investments. And as we look from where we were six months ago, we've picked up 2% in that mix. And so we're going to continue to push that business, so that we're buying more lots on an option basis, and engaging with developers, and looking for ways to work with them on an optioning basis. I don't know that we won't get there in 18 months, but it might also take us 30 months to get there. It's a little bit of a snapshot point in time as the quarter ends that we're measuring that, and land and lots are purchased and contracted on a dynamic basis throughout the year. So we're consistently looking to move that metric up and consistently looking to improve our returns. It's a big part of our regional presidents', division presidents' compensation plan is to be focused on returns. So they are the ones that make this happen, and they do it deal by deal and market by market. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our goal is not only consistency, but sustainability. And we've talked in the past about achieving something, if you can't grow it and maintain it, really is kind of a false achievement. So everything we're doing is set up to execute quarter to quarter a little better and sustain it off down the road into the future. Quarter to quarter, 52%, 53%, 54%, that's really not in our minds or anything that we spent a lot of time thinking about. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. I appreciate that. I understand. Second question, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the margin side, and kind of a two-part here. You were able to raise your gross margin guidance for the year, and I was just thinking about over the next year or two, is this 20.5% to 21% a range that you see as sustainable or do you see a little bit of possible upside to that as you continue to lever some of the fixed costs or get some more efficiencies? Conversely on the SG&A, just any thoughts around the fact that you reiterated the full year SG&A guidance ratio despite raising the revenues, typically, you'd see a little bit of leverage \u2013 incremental leverage if you were to raise revenues all else equal. And how do you think about SG&A over the next two or three years? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Michael, I'll kind of start at the bottom line and then we'll go ahead and go back to the pieces. We're first and foremost focused on improving our returns, and there's a lot of levers that allow us to achieve that. Certainly, as we've already touched on managing our inventory investments on our options is part of that. But we're very focused on improving our P&L metrics there as well to drive continued and improving returns. We're certainly seeing a good, healthy housing market, which is allowing us to see good stability and some lift in our margins, which has driven the adjustments in our guide on margin as well. And then with our volume, we're getting good leverage on SG&A as well. And we would expect to, we continue to do that, to work to improve that line item as well, all with the driver of improving our returns. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: As we've been working to improve returns, velocity of capital absorption pace within a given community is critical to achieving the returns. And so we're very pleased that executing on that strategy, maintaining the disciplined absorption and starts plans that we have in place community by community, we're able to see improving margins in today's environment. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I guess just being a little more specific though on SG&A, was there any type of reason why you weren't able to get a little bit more leverage off of a higher revenue base, all else equal? I mean the question is more evolved around are we kind of reaching a point where SG&A is at a natural level or is there incremental leverage there? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes, we're certainly pleased with where we are year to date on our SG&A. Our annual guidance from a revenue standpoint, we have increased the bottom end of our revenue range. Our top end of the revenue range is still in place. And so from an annual standpoint, we felt like our annual guidance was still realistic and reasonable relative to that annual revenue guide. But certainly, we're focused on achieving that and hopefully beating it. But at this point in time, we feel like the annual guidance was still at a reasonable level. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. So just getting back to rates and the impact on your buyers, the concern is obviously around sensitivity to rates, given your entry-level mix is higher there. But can you maybe speak to some of the tools that you guys have under your belt to offset some of that pressure for that buyer going forward? We've heard of point buydowns in some cases and longer rate locks. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're not seeing those kind of products with any kind of widespread use right now. As Jessica mentioned before, we're seeing an increasing pool of better qualified buyers, even with our larger exposure to the entry level in Express. Our mortgage company FICO score is the highest it's been in years this last quarter on current originations. And while interest rates are going up, I do think they're going up for the reasons we hoped is that it would strengthen the economy and we're seeing people with more jobs and better incomes, which are two of the primary drivers for household formations and home purchase decisions. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And what we would typically see first as buyers become more challenged if rates do continue to rise to a level that impacts affordability to any large extent is just a shift down in size of the home they're going to buy. So we have multiple floor plans in our communities. And right now, our average square footage in an Express community may be 2,000 square feet, but we've got a 1,500 or 1,600 square foot plan available that we're just not selling as many of. And as rates rise and affordability becomes more of a challenge, people still need to buy homes. They may just buy a little less home rather than the larger home. We're not seeing that today, as Mike indicated, but that would typically be the first shift, and we can flex very quickly to do that. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Right, that's helpful. And then switching to Forestar, as I look at the SG&A expense line, it's down 40% sequentially. So was that you guys just right-sizing the business this quarter? And when do you expect to get to that normalized 10% to 12% pre-tax margin by? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The first quarter for them, the prior quarter included a lot of their transaction costs, so they had a lot of unusual costs associated with the transaction, both deal costs associated with it as well as change-of-control type payments to employees. So this quarter is closer to a normalized SG&A rate for them. We would expect over time for their SG&A to need to grow, obviously, as they build out their platform. And then as they get to a normalized pace where they're delivering really the new profile of deals, the faster turning deals that they'll be delivering to D.R. Horton in 2019 and really by 2020, then that pre-tax operating margin of 10% to 12% would be our expectation at the current time. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, so you expect it by next year at some point. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think they'll be in that ballpark. They're still working through legacy assets, some of which are higher margin but lower turn. Newer assets will be a faster turn. And so I'd say by late 2019 and into 2020, you should start to see their profile get closer to that stabilized level that we described. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great, thank you. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thanks, Soham. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning, Ken. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I'd like you to comment on units under construction to improve investors' understanding of your business. With closings at 100% of backlog, I think that's less insightful than closings 44% of prior quarter's units under construction. So my one question has three parts. Please explain why you carry a spec unit for each unit in backlog, how you locally manage your construction cycles without a top-down infrastructure. And then, how does this help your asset velocity and lower your land risk, which is at 2.5-years supply? Thank you. That's it. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The first part of the question, why do we carry specs and what ratio is appropriate, we've managed the spec levels community by community, looking at construction cycle times, looking at sales demand in that submarket, and what the planned absorption is for that community. And we will start a number of homes that are unsold to meet the expected delivery demand that we're going to see. And our operating process is start the home and sell into that production cycle. But that's at a community-by-community level, and we will adjust those starts and that inventory level up or down depending upon market reaction and how our sales efforts are going. I'm not exactly sure what the second part of your question was about managing the construction cycle, essentially top-down because we certainly know that is a very local submarket by submarket with the teams in place that know their market the best, know their trades the best, what the trades are capable of doing, and how to maximize the efficiency with those trades to get the best labor pricing. On a national basis, what we're able to do on the pricing side is work with a lot of our national trade partners on leveraging our scale and purchasing power to keep our input costs as low as possible. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And then, you mentioned the asset velocity. And really what our local operators are doing when they're managing this community by community, when they open a community, they have a planned business plan and that is designed to strike the best balance between pace and price margin to generate the best return. And so they are executing to that plan and clearly asset turn, asset velocity, monthly absorption is an important part of that. And then, that's what they guide their business to. If they just start a little hot, and they sell a little bit more, they're more likely to moderate their pace to hit their absorption pace and push price and margin. If they're starting a little slow, they will push the absorption to make sure they stick to their absorption plan and make sure they do that to optimize their returns. So it's really governed by optimizing that balance to generate the best returns community by community. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And driving a return off of the land or lot investment does de-risk that land or lot investment, because we're going to move through that capital in the timeframe that we expected to at the outset of the project. Thereby, we pull that capital back into the company and we're able to re-deploy into current market. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And so the spec strategy is a key part of that in order to turn the land inventory and to keep that consistent pace going, having that inventory of specs in place to anticipate what we want to sell. What our absorption plans are for each month in that community is a vital part of it. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And having an adequate supply of specs in every committee makes this a viable alternative to the existing home sales that are out there, which as David mentioned before is a much larger market than the new home sales. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I have, by my count, Horton is the fourth builder this week to raise their full year gross margin targets. Can you talk about what's changed versus the last conference call, and maybe what you guys in the industry are seeing that gives you more confidence on that line item? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Jay, I would say three more months through the spring is really \u2013 we're seeing that the environment is good. We're seeing that we're hitting our absorption pace. We're seeing that we continue to have the ability to offset our cost with price community by community has given us that confidence level, and so we're pleased to be able to do that. And what we see today is continued stability, continued healthy market that we think the latter half of the year should support that higher guidance. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great. And then, I also wanted to touch on you guys with Freedom, you were one of the first movers on this empty-nester trend that seems to be gaining steam. Are you guys tracking anything in the field for your other product lines in terms of how many more empty-nesters or 55-plus buyers are coming in maybe versus this time last year or a couple of years ago? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Not really. I wouldn't say we're tracking. As we establish our Freedom flags in the markets, we're seeing better and better success. The Express communities have absorbed a lot of that 55 years, I call them blue-collar retiree, because it's just a lower-cost lifestyle. I mean that's a \u2013 that's a \u2013 from a demographic standpoint, it's a huge trend, and it also dovetails into the migration from high tax states to low tax states. So we believe it's not a long-term trend that we're going to see a lot of demand for the foreseeable future. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great, what are the long-term targets? Or how many Freedom flags you want out there? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're in 78 markets, some markets significantly bigger than others, but our goal is to get them rolled out, kind of like our Express program to a level in each market that the market will absorb. So it's going to be a big part of our growth over the next 5 to 7 years. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. Thanks very much, guys. And again, congratulations on the good results. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah. My first question actually relates to production efficiencies. Obviously you guys with the rollout of Express way before the competition, really got a jump on that, and it's been a huge part of the success of the company over the last few years. I was curious about what you thought about the opportunity to maybe take the next step in terms of productivity with the use of or the partnering with companies that do panelization or factory construction for the sake of simplicity, I'll call them E-builders. And so my question is basically two parts. One, what percent of the homes that you build today are using some extensive use of panelization, and is this an area that you're really focused on? And two, do you think the productivity gains that you might get will continue to be through low-tech strategies? Or do you think the integration of things like robotics or BIM [Building Information Modeling] modeling, logistics software et cetera, along with factory production holds real promise? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So first question, we do use panelization in various markets, and its market-by-market where those capabilities exist in the market, and can provide a timely and cost-effective solution for our local building operations. We are very happy using panelization, and we look to expand that and work with a trust plant in a given market to expand to see if they are capable of moving to the next step in panelization. So we do that. I don't have a percentage for you of what the breakdown is across the country, but it is something that we do monitor, measure, and continually challenge our existing assumptions about what the most efficient way is to deliver a home to a customer. In terms of the higher tech, I would say broadly, yes, Stephen, I think there will be production efficiencies to be gained in our industry through this. Do I know which one it is yet? No I don't. But we are evaluating those and we are watching those, and we're very interested in paying attention to what's happening there. I think there's some really interesting things happening, and we're excited to play a part in that. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC : Yeah, that makes sense. I just want to follow-up on that if I could, Michael. You mentioned that it depends \u2013 your use depends a little bit on if the local market can support your use of that. And I was curious if you -- that seems to suggest there may be some sort of a bottleneck in certain markets. And I was curious if that supply issue or bottleneck had to do with an availability of capital? And if that's so, if you would be interested in partnering with some of these kind of initiatives to sort of get them jump-started to get to the kind of scale where they could actually support somebody of your size? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Again, it is going to vary very much market by markets. Where there are markets, where there are very efficient labor sources that are able to stick frame a home and construct a home in the traditional fashion. It's a difficult barrier to overcome, the cost efficiencies, it takes to bring panelization in place. Other markets that are higher labor cost markets, we've seen more rapid adoption of panelization. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I will say, Stephen, affordability in housing is just going to become more and more difficult to maintain, and even at our Express level, there are still a significant amount of the population that's priced out of homeownership. So we have got to get better, and I think technology and different ways of thinking about constructing houses is going to be how that takes place. Because I don't see labor going down, and I don't see materials going down, and land, certainly, is not going to go down, so how you build a house, to me, everybody at some point in their life ought to be able to own a house. And that's just not the case today in the United States, and it's certainly not the case in the world. So that's something we think about a lot. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Over time, this industry and this company will put that puzzle together of marrying the technology, marrying the new techniques with the unique attributes of how you build out a community. Every piece of real estate is different, every local market is different, but marrying those things market by market will happen and will happen for this industry and for this company. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It was a very important thing to me when I was able to buy my first house. And I can tell you, I think that helped me become the success \u2013 whatever success I've achieved I think that was a part of it, so everybody ought to get to experience that. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC : That's great. I really appreciate it, and I wish I had bought the same house you did. I'm going to find out which house that is. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Don't be confused, and I lost money on my house, with a 13.5% interest rate and my payment was ridiculously high for a guy starting out, so. Stephen Kim - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Well, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. So I just wanted to ask about your updated thoughts on share repurchases. Obviously, the cash flow outlook is very strong, obviously, rates and the guidance for this year. And, obviously, Forestar is on track to be more self-sufficient next year. You maintained your intention to just buy back to the extent to offset dilution. Any updated thoughts on going beyond that? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Over the longer term, Nishu, yes, so we would expect that we would do that. But for the short run, we are getting established with being a consistent repurchase for our shares each quarter. As you know, we have not historically done that on a consistent basis, so we are in the early stages of beginning a long-term share repurchase program. And so right now we're starting at a level that we're comfortable with within our cash flow. Obviously, our cash flow is used for a number of purposes this year. We had a major acquisition early in the year. We continue to pay a dividend at a healthy rate as well. And so we're beginning the share repurchase at a modest level, but we would expect it would increase over time. First step is to offset dilution here by 2020. And then, as our share \u2013 as our cash flow grows, as our business grows, we would expect that to grow \u2013 to continue to grow over time as well. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Again, to us, it's about consistent and sustainable over a long period of time. The flash buys, in my experience, don't do much for shareholders long term. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And what do you need to see specifically to feel that \u2013 to conclude, basically, that you've been successful in creating a consistent cash-flow-generating machine? I mean, you're going to be over $800 million this year. And at this stage of the cycle when the market is going well, that's a very strong number. And I think you've maintained the $1.25 billion target for 2019, or even mentioned it. I would love to know if your real thoughts on that are different. So coming out of $1.20 billion, you will have been three years averaging about $1 billion a year. At that stage, do you say, yeah, we've been successful in our goals and maybe we can consider a sustainable program? What exactly are you going to use to judge that kind of metric or number wise? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, it's going to be on balance with all aspects of our business. What we see overall in our business, what we see in our opportunities to continue to invest in growing our business, what we see on the M&A front, as well is then what we just see in terms of our outlook on the market. So what I would say is we do believe that we have been very successful at building a cash-flow-generating machine. We've generated positive cash flow for three straight years. This will be the fourth year, and it gave us the confidence to begin the share repurchase program. And so now we will just build on that quarter by quarter, year by year. And as we continue to make progress quarter by quarter, then I would expect the share repurchase to increase alongside it. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got you. Got you. And... David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're going to stay opportunistic, too. I mean, the investment we made in Forestar we think is going to be significantly better for our shareholders than increasing our stock buyback by $500 million this year. So it's \u2013 we're out there looking at the market, and making what we believe are the best long-term decisions for our shareholders. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Got it. And on Forestar, the 10,000-lot delivery goal, I think that was the third year out, so \u2013 for fiscal 2020. As you've been developing the pipeline, any kind of updated thinking on what percentage of those might be delivered to D.R. Horton? And what percentage might be external? How D.R. Horton linked will \u2013 do you expect Forestar to be at that stage, especially now that you have some clarity with 38 deals having been vetted so far? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The first couple of years here, 2018, 2019, 2020, it's going to be very \u2013 more heavily weighted towards Horton than it will be over the longer term. Over the longer term, as David mentioned earlier, we met with the Forestar team this week and they would expect to deliver to other builders over the longer term 20% to 30% of their deliveries to other builders. It's going to take them a bit of time to develop their sourcing capabilities, but they do have existing relationships with other builders today, and are delivering lots to other builders today. But their sourcing capabilities are going to be largely driven by Horton here in the short run. But 20% to 30% would be a good range for the long term for other builders. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Donna. We appreciate everyone's time on the call and look forward to speaking with you again in July to share our third quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, another spectacular quarter, it's \u2013 it's \u2013 makes us proud to sit up here and be able to represent you. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica, please go ahead. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you Kevin and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next few days. Consistent with the last two quarters, our consolidated financials present our homebuilding, Forestar land development, financial services and other operations on a combined basis. The segment information following the consolidated financials in our press release includes detailed financial information for all of our reporting segments. And as a reminder, after this call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentation section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you Jessica and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined by Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our President and CEO, David Auld, sends his apologies for not being on the call today. He is not feeling well and we expect him back in the office in a day or two. The D.R. Horton team continues to produce strong results in 2018. In the third quarter, consolidated pre-tax income increased 39% to $616 million on a 17% increase in revenues to $4.4 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 210 basis points to 13.9% and our 12% sales growth was consistent with our business plan. For the nine months ended June 30, consolidated pre-tax income increased 30% to $1.5 billion on a 16% increase in revenue to $11.6 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the nine-month period improved 140 basis points to 12.6%. These results put us on track to meet or exceed our guidance on all metrics for the full year of 2018 and it reflects the strength of our operational team's diverse product offerings and ability to leverage our scale across a broad geographic footprint. Our continued strategic focus is to produce double-digit annual growth in both revenue and pre-tax profits while increasing annual operating cash flows and returns. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory was 19.1%, an improvement of 280 basis points from a year ago. For the nine months ended June, we generated $534 million of cash from operations excluding Forestar. With 29,800 homes in inventory at the end of June and 278,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for the fourth quarter and to support further growth in 2019. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the third quarter increased 57% to $454 million or $1.18 per diluted share compared to $289 million or $0.76 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased 39% to $616 million versus $445 million a year ago and homebuilding pre-tax income increased 42% to $590 million compared to $415 million. Our backlog conversion rate for the third quarter was 89%, at the high end of our guidance range. As a result, our third quarter home sales revenue increased 16% to $4.3 billion on 14,114 homes closed, up from $3.7 billion on 12,497 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $302,000, up 3% from the prior year quarter. The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 13% from the prior year to $4.4 billion and homes sold increased 12% to 14,650 homes. Our third quarter sales growth was driven by a 15% increase in community sales pace offset by a 3% decrease in our average number of active selling communities. Our average community count was flat sequentially from the second quarter. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $298,000 and the 21% cancellation rate during the quarter was consistent with the same quarter last year. The value of our backlog increased 7% from a year ago to $5 billion with an average sales price per home of $301,000 and homes in backlog increased 9% to 16,536 homes. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We are experiencing healthy market conditions across most of our markets with solid demand, especially at affordable price points. And the supply of new homes remains limited. In this environment, we are reducing sales incentives or raising prices in communities where we are achieving our targeted sales base while striving to ensure that our product offerings remain affordable. Land and construction costs are generally increasing and we are utilizing our scale and relationships to control cost increases. Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter improved 110 basis points sequentially from March and 210 basis points from the prior year quarter to 21.9%. 120 basis points of the improvement from last year was due to net sales price increases in excess of lot and construction cost increases. An additional 60 basis points of the increase was due to lower litigation and warranty costs, 20 basis points was from lower interest costs and the remaining 10 basis points of improvement was due to less impact from purchase accounting. Based on current market conditions, we expect our fourth quarter home sales gross margin will be relatively consistent with the third quarter. However, as a reminder, we may experience quarterly fluctuations in our gross margin due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and interest costs. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of our revenues was 8.1%, an improvement of 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 8.7%, which was also down 30 basis points from the prior year period. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our expected growth. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $30.3 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 31% compared to $33.9 million of pre-tax income and a 37% pre-tax profit margin in the prior year quarter. Financial services profit margin declined this quarter primarily from lower pricing on loan origination sales due to competitive pressures in the mortgage market. 97% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 48% in the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 46% in the same quarter last year. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We ended the third quarter with 29,800 homes in inventory. 14,000 of our total homes were unsold with 10,400 in various stages of construction and 3,600 completed. Compared to a year ago, we have 8% more homes in inventory. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our homebuilding investments in lots, land and development during the third quarter totaled $929 million of which $502 million was for finished lots and land acquisition and $427 million was for land development. During the nine months ended June, we invested $2.7 billion in lots, land and development consistent with the same period last year. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of 278,000 lots of which 122,000 or 44% were owned and 156,000 or 56% were controlled through option contracts. 109,000 of our total homebuilding lots were finished of which 34,000 were owned and 75,000 were optioned. 11,100 of our option lots at June 30 were owned or controlled by Forestar. We have increased our homebuilding option lot position 23% from a year ago and are making progress towards our target to have 60% of our total homebuilding lot pipeline optioned while keeping our number of owned lots near the current level. We plan to continue expanding our relationships with land developers across the country as well as growing our majority-owned Forestar lot development operations. Our 278,000 homebuilding lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage in the current housing market and sufficient to support our expected growth. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded lot development company, now operating in 20 markets and 11 states. At June 30, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 19,100 lots, of which 1,200 are finished. 11,100 of Forestar's lots are under contract with D.R. Horton, or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement between our two companies. Our expectations for Forestar are consistent with what we shared on last quarter's call. Forestar is on track to grow its annual deliveries to approximately 10,000 lots, generating $700 million to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2020 with a stabilized pre-tax profit margin in the range of 10% to 12%. These expectations are for Forestar's standalone results. Forestar's long-term success will be dependent on its ability to maintain strong operating liquidity and raise growth capital. We are pleased to report that Forestar's process to obtain a bank credit facility is going well and is expected to be finalized by the end of this fiscal year. We also expect Forestar to file a shelf registration statement and to access the public debt and/or equity markets in fiscal 2019 as conditions permit. Forestar is targeting a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or less. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar is advancing our strategy to increase our access to option lot positions and enhance our operational efficiency and returns. We are very excited about Forestar's growing operating platform and the value this relationship will create over the long-term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar's shareholders. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At June 30, our homebuilding liquidity included $748 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 260 basis points from a year ago to 22.2%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion, and we have $500 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. During the first nine months of fiscal 2018, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $306.5 million. And excluding Forestar, we generated $533.8 million of cash from operations for the nine-month period. We expect to achieve our target of greater than $800 million in operating cash flow for fiscal 2018. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $47.2 million, and we repurchased approximately 609,000 shares of our common stock for $27 million. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $8.6 billion, and book value per share was $22.80, up 15% from a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board of Directors increased our share repurchase authorization to $400 million, effective through September 2019, replacing the prior authorization. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility, and we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding leverage and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have been actively pursuing select acquisitions across the country and expect to deploy more capital for this purpose over the next year. This quarter, we purchased the assets of two small private builders for approximately $18 million. We acquired Lexington Homes to enter the Spokane, Washington market and Permian Homes to solidify our position as the largest builder in the Midland/Odessa market in Texas. We welcome the Lexington and Permian teams to the D.R. Horton family. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: As we mentioned in our press release this morning, based on current market conditions and our results for the first nine months of the year, we're increasing our guidance for consolidated pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2018 to a range of 12.7% to 12.9% on expected consolidated revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.3 billion this year. In the fourth quarter, we expect our number of homes closed will approximate a beginning backlog conversion rate in a range of 90% to 93%. We anticipate our fourth quarter home sales gross margin will be relatively consistent with the third quarter, and we expect our homebuilding SG&A in the fourth quarter to be around 8% of homebuilding revenues. We expect our income tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 26%. Our expectations are based on current market conditions. Our preliminary expectations for fiscal 2019 are for consolidated revenues to increase 10% to 15% and to achieve a consolidated pre-tax margin of approximately 13% for the full year of fiscal 2019. We anticipate our tax rate for fiscal 2019 will be approximately 25% and that our outstanding share count will remain consistent with fiscal 2018. Looking further out, we expect to continue to grow our annual revenues and profits at a double-digit pace and increase our annual operating cash flows, excluding Forestar, to over $1.25 billion by fiscal 2020. We also expect to maintain our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory around 20%, beginning in fiscal 2019. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: To conclude and reiterate, our growth in sales, closings, profits, returns and cash flows is a result of the strength of our long-tenured people and well-established operating platforms across the country. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry-leading market share. We remain focused on growing both our revenues and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while increasing our annual operating cash flows and improving returns in our business and to our shareholders. We are well positioned to do so with our solid balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, diversified product offerings across our D.R. Horton, Emerald, Express and Freedom brands, attractive finished lot and land positions and most importantly, our outstanding team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work. We look forward to finishing our 40th anniversary year strong, while preparing for great opportunities in the years to come. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host any questions. Operator : Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you and good morning, everybody. First, I'll start with the land. The option jumped up to 56%. It's a big jump you all have been talking about getting to 60%. It seems like now maybe that 60% is readily achievable. So just would like to understand your thoughts there? And then, how did Forestar play a role in any of that jump, and what we should expect moving forward? I know they've acquired \u2013 as of last quarter, they had 21 deals. How many deals do they have in place now? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well, Stephen, good morning. We are very excited about the progress we're making towards increasing our option percentage. We're at 56% this quarter, but we do expect fluctuations up and down in that number. It's a fairly dynamic measurement. And it can move a little bit day-to-day. In fact, it does move a bit day-to-day. We are making progress in the right direction, but we expect to see that continue to fluctuate. But we do believe we will be achieving the 60% target, probably not going to be by the end of this week, but we will be doing that over the next couple of years. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the Forestar lot count in our option position is 11,100 of our 156,000 option lots. So it is playing a role in that percentage moving up. We're not planning to provide project counts anymore. We're providing their market counts, their owned and option lot position each quarter going forward. We would, of course, expect to update guidance as necessary for lot deliveries and revenues. But we really believe that their lot position is the best indicator of progress and their future growth. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough, fair enough. And then as you look at your order growth, lot of talking in the markets and we've seen some builders not deliver particularly good order paces. Could you talk about a little bit but what you saw in demand through the quarter? And then what you all were seeing out West and in particular California? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Stephen we saw a good demand throughout the quarter. I mean there was normal seasonality played itself out in the quarter as we expected it would. But we had very good demand across our footprint, specifically out West in California. At the the price points we're serving, we see a lot of buyers, a lot of demand, a lot of traffic. We don't have a lot of standing available inventory out in our West region at all, especially in California. Demand has been very strong. Our absorptions per community I think out West were up 15% and really excited about the projects that the team has positioned us in there and the execution against those projects. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. John Lovallo - Bank of America : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my call. The first question is a very interesting comment about your balance sheet strength, liquidity and earnings growth increasing your strategic and financial flexibility. I just want to maybe dig in a little bit deeper there and how you guys are thinking about A, acquisitions, are there bigger targets out there that might make sense for you guys to get deeper in your markets? And then B, your appetite for share repurchases, considering the $400 million that you put in place and what we think is a pretty big dislocation between your current stock price and reality? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: John, good morning. I'll take the acquisition part of that question. It is very much a big part of our capital allocation plans. We've been actively looking and we are actively looking. The two acquisitions we did this quarter were somewhat small, but they were \u2013 put us into a new market and was accretive in another market that we really like and believe in. We have several more that we're looking at over the next few quarters in the year and probably $400 million to $600 million of purchase price on those is what we're looking at today. We continue to be primarily interested in private builders with very high quality teams where we either consolidate share in markets that we already operate in or enter new markets and further expand the footprint across the country. That's been the primary focus to date. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah and John this is Bill. In terms of our capital allocation, obviously flexibility is key to us right now and we still see great opportunities in our housing markets to continue to invest in that and aggregate market share. And obviously acquisitions are an important part of that as well. With that flexibility, we have begun to repurchase shares. We began repurchasing shares about a year ago. And as we've stated before, we want to be consistent in that. We want to be able to do that consistently over a long-term with our first step or first benchmark in that beginning to keep our outstanding share count flat. And clearly we're on track to do that here by fiscal 2019. And I think the key for our share repurchase program is we want to be able to continue to do it consistently and then increase it incrementally over the next year, and then over the longer term we will evaluate that alongside all of our other opportunities at different points in the market. John Lovallo - Bank of America : Okay that's helpful. And then as a follow-up, in fiscal year 2019, you guys reiterated that there'll either be a debt or equity raised out of Forestar. What will it take kind of to get things moving there on that front? I think clearly issuing the equity out of Forestar I think would be a major catalyst for your shares. And what do you guys kind of need to see before you'd be comfortable doing that? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Well we've been focused first and foremost on putting a bank facility in place. And so that is ongoing. That's going very well. We expect that to get completed by the end of this next quarter \u2013 by the end of the fiscal year, which has been our target. And alongside that, we'll begin the process of preparing Forestar for the public markets. So filing a shelf, working with rating agencies to prepare for the debt markets with the target of then having them in position to go to the public markets next year. Now we would probably anticipate a debt offering first, as they have very little debt on their balance sheet. And so we would do that, certainly demonstrate the ability for them to raise debt capital and then have an eye on the equity markets as well. We certainly believe that an equity raise for Forestar is an important part. I do agree with you there. But at this point we're focused on bank facility first and then likely debt market second. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And Forestar has $370 million of cash on their balance sheet today, which is sufficient for their near term working capital needs, especially once they get the bank credit facility in place. John Lovallo - Bank of America : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey guys. Good morning. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Great job on the orders. Very impressive considering some of the other mixed data points we're seeing out there. So I generally think about your inventory \u2013 your homes in inventory that you provide us every quarter as a pretty good leading indicator of where you kind of see the volume side of the business going since such a high percentage of your sales are specs. I think you mentioned inventory is up about 8% year-over-year, which is obviously solid growth, a little bit below kind of the double-digit range you've been growing the business recently. So I guess I was just curious if you think about your 2019 guide for 10% to 15% top line growth, do you have implied in there kind of an implicit organic growth expectation versus what you might expect to see coming through M&A given the pipeline you're looking at today? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In our forward guidance on growth, Alan what we're looking at is purely organic. The M&A work we're planning to execute it but our 10% to 15% growth we believe is very achievable with the organic lot positions we have today. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Okay. So any M&A would be potentially additive to that? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: To within a 10% or 15% yeah, so if... Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Okay. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: ...within that range. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Within that range. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. And second question again kind of on the inventory topic within the industry. We have seen new home inventory starting to climb up a little bit. I think some of that might be a function of maybe some of your peers entering the entry level space and expect more than they traditionally have. It doesn't sound like you're really seeing much pressure on the incentive front or pricing side from competitors. But as you look into the back half of the year and you look at some of the results your peers are reporting, is there any conservatism on your side under the premise that some other builders might incentivize to drive their volume numbers up? Obviously you guys have grown very consistently, but others have not been quite as consistent. So if they do start to incentivize, how do you think about that affecting your business and your overall inventory position? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So, yeah the decision to incentivize or not and how it impacts us is a community by community decision and very specific. And we would monitor and react or proactively take action at a given community. And that's what our local teams are monitoring that day to day to day, ensuring that we're having the sales pace we desire for a given community while maximizing returns in that community. So from a macro level at sort of the perspective we have here at the corporate office, we are entrusting our local divisions to make those right decisions to drive their pace and achieve the returns they're looking for. Not feeling that we're going to see a lot of competitive market margin pressure broadly space because we're seeing that every day to day and we're posting margin returns that we are at today from the communities. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah and generally we would agree we're still not seeing much inventory growth out there especially at the affordable price points. We're still at very limited supply in the marketplace which is allowing us right now to raise price and reduce incentives which is showing up in our margin. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: That's great to hear. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats on the results. And also hope David is feeling better. First question I just kind of wanted to circle back to a question on demand. Obviously you've gotten a couple of questions already on it. But I think it bears warrants some focus just given what's gone on in the market the last week or two and some of the, as previously said, mixed results from the competitors. Your results really stand out in contrast and kind of recognizing that you said you thought there was good demand throughout the quarter and across your footprint even California. Clearly it seems like there is some contrasting data points out there and couple of builders pointing to May being a little softer. Even your competitor earlier this morning talking about even some weakness on the first-time front, which is particularly surprising. So again I guess I just wanted to, in my first question, just revisit and maybe asked another way, the order growth that you saw or the sales pace that you saw, obviously adjusting for seasonality, that \u2013 was there any I guess change in patterns? Was May a little bit weaker? Or was June a little bit stronger that's of note? And as it relates to the first-time strength, do you feel that you're perhaps just better positioned from a price standpoint and an affordability standpoint that allows you guys to perhaps be a little bit better insulated from any minor or moderate demand volatility? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure. Mike, I'll take a stab at that. I think you have several questions in there. So I hope I'll hit them all. But for the quarter, we saw a typical seasonality. So we saw a very strong demand as we moved throughout the quarter and just typical seasonality as we moved into the early summertime. We do believe that our outperformance as it pertains to our sales really is because of our positioning and our product offerings across the country. If you look at our results this quarter, it'll be posted in our supplementary data after the call, but Express was 37% of our sales and closings and our new Freedom brand is now 3% of our sales. So those are very affordable product offerings that we are very focused on keeping affordable. So there's still extremely limited supply at affordable price points. And so where we can get that product on the ground, we continue to see very robust demand and no sign of weakness at those price points. So I think that's the main reason that's differentiating us when you look at our sales versus some of the others out there in the industry today. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Appreciate that Jessica. So thank you for that. I mean I guess second question just the strength on the gross margins coming in above your guidance and you expect it to also be achievable in the fourth quarter. It seems like some of that will carry over into fiscal 2019 as well, as you're expecting a little bit higher pre-tax. And I'd assume kind of driven roughly equally by gross and SG&A. I guess as the demand environment, to the extent that it does change at all, is that something where \u2013 I mean when you're looking at the gross margins where they are today, do you see that as kind of a peakish-type number where you feel that the gross margins don't necessarily need or shouldn't go much higher and that now you can use more of a pivot if you need to towards maintaining or ensuring that volume growth? Or is that something that you'd like to see go even higher over the next year or two? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah Mike. Thanks Mike. As we've stated pretty consistently, we're first focused on returns. And so we operate our business community by community making the decisions each day balancing pace and price, margin and absorption to generate the best return on our inventory investment. And in this limited supply environment, with very strong demand and with our positioning, in a great position for that demand at affordable price points, right now the market is giving us the opportunity to reduce incentives and increase prices. And that results in higher gross margin. So in a market environment such as this, we're seeing that opportunity. But we will continue to focus on returns regardless of how the market may change in the future. We're really primarily focused on returns first and foremost. That being said, with what we can see in the market today, we see a healthy market. We see very good demand. We still see a very good balance of supply and demand. And so that's reflected in our guidance both for the fourth quarter and our preliminary guidance for 2019. We see an environment where we should be able to maintain our gross margins in the range of where we are today and where we reported in the third quarter. There could be quarters that are slightly higher than. There would be quarters slightly lower. But we expect to be able to maintain margins at a sustainable level around the same level as Q3. Implication for our operating margin increase next year assumes relatively flat gross margins with the current level with continued leverage on SG&A. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning all. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: So we were out looking at places in Northern California since everyone is talking about it just the other day and it was very clear to us that your spec approach enables you to get orders intra quarter versus someone taking an order for let's say January or February. So I think that helps support what we're seeing in your orders. But relative to that, could you comment on the spread of specs versus backlog orders, the gross margin, A? And then B do you think there is an impact of rising existing inventory on new home sale pace within their specific markets? Thank you. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah first Ken on the margin on specs. Clearly in a market like today, with limited supply, our margins on specs are better than usual. The spread between our margins on specs versus build jobs is tighter than normal because we're in a rising price environment, limited supply and we have inventory on the ground. So that's resulting in better margins than normal. And then in terms of the order pace and the reports of orders in a market is certainly affected by the amount of supply, hard to sell houses if there's not much supply. So clearly as we have introduced new communities, introduced product at affordable price points in markets that did not have it before, I do believe we're unlocking demand and releasing pent-up demand that's in markets today. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And as we look at existing supply that's out there in the marketplace, the first place we look at available supply is in our own neighborhoods. And we're seeing that less than half the homes we have in our inventory are available for sale. We're selling a lot of homes before they're completed, before \u2013 during the construction process. And so we're not seeing excess new home supply coming to bear in the places we're most concerned about, which is at or near our neighborhoods. Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Bill the comment that you made of raising price and reducing incentives in environment where some are seeing a little bit of a pause in orders. Just can you talk a little more about that? I know you just spoke to where inventories are but what do you think that you're doing that's allowing you to have that success during the period of time where it's perhaps wobbling a bit for some others? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think it starts with positioning. It's positioning our product in our communities at an affordable price and having available inventory as well our spec strategy. I think customers are looking for a home that they can have some certainty on when they can move at. And so I think that's put us in a good position to be able to move price and not have to incent very much today. We balance that always with first and foremost focusing on returns and achieving our target sales pace in each community. And we're also always keeping an eye on making sure that our products remain affordable. So while we are certainly seeing some increase in pricing and net incentives today, we will continue to make sure that our products remain affordable. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And our scale, clearly both nationally and locally, is a huge driver of us being able to keep our costs in check. Nationally, on the materials side, we've got fantastic partners that are helping us navigate a rising cost environment. And when you look at our true stick and brick or just building cost, our purchasing teams have done a fantastic job on that front as well. And our local scale has really helped us along with our Express Homes business model, limiting floor plans, limiting options and building the same floor plan and house over and over and over again, so our trades can be very efficient and we can pay them less for that work, but they can make more money because they can get through so many more houses being that much more efficient. We continue to see this quarter our revenues slightly outpace our stick and brick costs on a per square footage basis on a year-over-year basis and the cost inflation we saw on the stick and brick and both the lot \u2013 the lot cost side was right around the mid-single-digit range. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Then roughly Forestar it seems like you're off to a good start. As you project out 12 or 18 months, how do you think how the business is run and what the results look like is influenced by Forestar? How's life different as you have that integrated and start to scale that? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah as we see life, we're starting to see that life take shape now where we're being much more collaborative early on in deal flow and working with Forestar and determining which projects would be good candidates for Forestar to bring to market. And they're identifying some opportunities organically that will be accretive to the Horton portfolio as well as their third-party builder sales. So we're excited about seeing that growth that they have, the capital that they have today and will increase over the next year, is going to be an exciting time for them to recruit more folks to their team and continue to build out their operational capabilities over the next 12 to 18 months. And that's what \u2013 frankly what we're most excited about is really putting a great organic team together that's going to be a national lot developer with access to deep pools of capital at a cost advantage to what that marketplace is like today. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: That's helpful. Great. Thank you. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the response to one of the prior questions on costs. I think you said stick and brick was up mid-single digits, A, was curious if you could give us whether that includes labor and then B, outside of lumber, what are some of the other areas that you're seeing the most meaningful cost pressures? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So mike the stick and brick when we use that phrase we really mean labor and materials. So it's all inclusive. We continue to see that mid-single digit cost inflation being driven almost solely by labor. Although we think we're doing a great job keeping our labor costs in check, it is a tight labor supply environment and we're having to continue to pay a little bit more to get our houses built, but we're more than happy to do that in the market we're in today. And are working to continue to be as efficient as possible to reduce labor costs where we can. Outside of \u2013 lumber has been a cost pressure. It probably is the headliner. A little bit of noise commodity-wise to concrete. But generally speaking, anywhere we've seen an increase we've had a category where we've been able to offset it. We're now nationally exclusive in over 30 product categories. And those don't all renew at the same time. So each year when we go back out to market with our national exclusive agreements that are renewing, we've had very good success in either just locking in our current pricing and not having to take a price increase or even reducing our prices further. So really appreciate all of our trade partners out there today that are helping us along the way. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's interesting. Thanks. Then on the gross margin conversation, as it relates to next year, it's interesting because just given how quickly and meaningfully you've ramped up your option portfolio over the past year-and-a-half plus, would think that a greater mix of deliveries next year will be coming from land that was originally optioned and normally you'd see some trade-off on gross margin. So can you just talk to are we seeing that mix occur and just the pricing power is such that you're able to overcome that or just how should we think about that over the next year? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah Mike we've been seeing that mix shift over the last several years. Three years ago or so we were around 30% option lots and now we're north of 50%. And so we've been able to \u2013 we certainly pay more for a finished lot when we buy it from a third-party developer. But we've been able to obviously improve our returns through that process. And with our focus on executing well community by community, we've been able to offset that increase in lot price and still maintain good margins. And so we still believe we're in good position that even as our option percentage continues to rise further, we believe our operations are in great shape to be able to absorb that and keep our margins at the level relatively close to today's level. Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit to I guess the rollout that you're seeing within the Freedom product. I mean it sounds like that's definitely gaining some momentum there. And so can you talk to what you're seeing on that side? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah, Susan. Thank you. We are enjoying some success with Freedom. It's rolling out slower certainly than Express rolled out, but we expected it was going to be slower but it's growing. I think it's about 3% of sales right now, which is a significant increase from where it was. It's growing as a part of our overall product mix. And that's overall against a growing backdrop. So it's doing really well. We get that product on the ground and we see the buyer really like the product that we're offering, the sense of community we're trying to create in an affordable platform for those buyers where we can take a retiree that's a little concerned about monthly expenses and still try to give them a lot of the lifestyle value of the Freedom Home or the Active Adult neighborhood in a plan that's exactly right for their lifestyles, two bedrooms, a flex room, two-and-a-half bathrooms, it's a great focus for us in a one-story home. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So you'll see in our brand stratification that we'll post after the call, the ASP on Freedom today is right around $260,000 and that typical home Mike talked about is about 1800 square feet. So focused on keeping it as affordable as possible just as we have with our Express brand. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. That's helpful, that color. And then I guess can you talk a little bit to what you're seeing just in terms of some of the labor and the raw material side of things there. Obviously we're hearing of a lot of inflation coming through with some of the suppliers. Can you talk to how you're thinking about that? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Certainly on the labor side one of the things we look at is our build times. And we have seen our teams maintain consistent build times for the past several years from when we start a home to complete it, that time has not moved but by a few days up or down on our completions and deliveries. And so part of that speaks to the spec strategy we have, part of that speaks to the local scale we have in given markets and long and deep relationships with those labor suppliers. And as Jessica mentioned before our returns-focused approach to the communities to drive to the pace, we believe is appropriate and creates a more efficient platform for that labor, so that they're able to get to more houses, get to more simplistic processes in those houses. And they can frankly charge us less per square foot but still make more money for themselves on a day-to-day basis. So we're really excited about the results we're seeing there and how our teams are delivering and staying on top of that labor. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So going back to the gross margin question. Very, very strong performance here and looks like it will be sustained into next year. As we think about earlier in the cycle, normal margin range was closer to 20%, now we're 150, 200 basis points above that. What do you see as the major drivers of that? And also just related to that, on new deals, do they pencil to the higher gross margin rate in the pro formas? Or do we need to see this favorable price versus mix to kind of sustain this higher level that we're seeing now? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I know I sound like a broken record a little bit. But we do focus first and foremost on returns. And then the market in each community then and our ability to achieve our sales pace then helps us determine whether the margin will be higher than pro forma or lower than pro forma. So when we are pro-forma-ing a project, yes, typically the gross margins are in the high teens to the low-20s. It's usually somewhere in that range. But really our underwriting hurdle is to achieve a 20% net return on inventory investment based on the pre-tax income of the project. And that is always at 20% or better on every investment that we're making. And so, yeah, we're in a good environment right now. There's very \u2013 I think the \u2013 really, the main driver is there's very limited supply of new homes in the market, especially at affordable price points. And with our positioning and the execution of our teams and the continued improvements in efficiency throughout our business, I believe those are the primary drivers behind what has now manifested itself in our gross margins here this quarter. One other aspect in our gross margins, which we've talked about a bit last year, we had a period where our litigation and warranty costs were a bit higher than normal. The last three quarters or so, those costs have been at a more normal range. And so this quarter, 60 basis points of our year-over-year improvement in gross margin was from a reduction of litigation and warranty costs. We do expect those levels to remain pretty consistent going forward, which is again as part of our guide for margins to remain consistent. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: The other sustained improvement in our gross margins that we expect is from lower interest costs as we continue to de-lever our homebuilding business. And we think that's a big advantage in terms of what we've done with our balance sheet and the limited interest costs we now have to carry and cover in our gross margin. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it, got it. Very helpful. And second question on Forestar, obviously, with the successful rollout of the Forestar plan. Looking ahead to the capital raise, the 40% leverage ratio on a net debt to cap basis that you're targeting for that, that's normally what you would see for a homebuilder? One might think that on a land development business somewhat higher risk might merit lower targeted debt to cap. Obviously, there's no debt at the moment or so far off from it. But just wanted to understand the thinking behind that to that level? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure. We stated 40% or less. Today it's significantly less than that. Today they have a negative leverage. And so as we look at the 40%, we look at that as a longer term cap, really kind of a maximum level that they would operate at, which certainly is comparable to some homebuilders, but when you look across the homebuilder universe, there's builders operating at a higher level of leverage than that. But they're not going to be at 40% overnight. It's something that as they grow out their platform, as they grow out their earning capacity, that that would be kind of a maximum level over time. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the way we expect to run Forestar is really not what, I think, people traditionally think about a historical land developer platform. We're really thinking of Forestar as a lot manufacturer that's going to have D.R. Horton, the largest builder in the country, as one of its largest customers who needs an immense amount of finished lots. And there is a shortage of finished lots across the entire country today. So we think Forestar has a very unique opportunity to take advantage of that opportunity in the market. And plan to run with the modest leverage to help them grow that platform that there is a need for in the industry today. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: That would be a much more efficient model than you've seen in the land development business and not going to be large concentrations of individual assets. It's going to be spread across a broad geographic footprint with fast turning lot deliveries. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Production focused, return focused developer. Nishu Sood - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, Good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. Just wanted to revisit the issue of buyer behavior and wanted to see if you guys are seeing any change there today in terms of square footage being bought or buyers moving to ARM loans today? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No, we're really not, which really to us points to the market still being affordable, at least where we're positioned in the market. We continue to see our FICO score be very strong. We saw our first-time homebuyer percentage tick up. Our average square footage is relatively consistent. And really even the percentage of our buyers that are purchasing an attach product, whether it be a duplex or a townhome, hasn't risen that much either. So kind of all of those signs for us point to the market still generally speaking, in most parts of the country, is pretty affordable. There's just a lack of supply which does impact demand. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay great. That's helpful. And then second one was on order growth next year. And so sort of as we think about the drivers for growth next year, how much of your order growth is going to be driven by community count versus an improvement in pace, especially as you face higher land, labor and material costs? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So Soham, we don't ever guide to community count officially for a reason. It's one of the hardest things for us to manage. We really focus internally more first on our houses and our lot position. And that'll tell you where we're headed. As long as we have the houses and the lots that tells you that we are going to be replenishing at a minimum our community count if not ultimately growing it. We have said that we would expect it to grow at some point. We still haven't seen that. It was down 3% year-over-year, but it was essentially flat sequentially. So feel very confident about our ability to meet our 10% to 15% consolidated revenue targets with 278,000 lots owned and controlled and almost 30,000 homes in inventory today. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : I guess another way to ask it is do you continue to see pace improvement into next year? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Beyond today? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yes. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Thanks very much. My first question related to the West. I think you indicated that you are continuing to see some very strong results out there. I think you said absorptions worth about 15%. I think that would imply that the community count was probably down about a comparable amount since your orders were about flat and so I was wondering if you could... Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Steve, I was actually \u2013 I probably pulled the number out of my head and I should've looked at the schedule. Our absorption pace was actually up 7%. Yeah... Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Okay. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: ...in the west. So the community count would imply to be about down 7%. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : All right. Well that defuses that question because 7%... Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sorry about that. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : No problem. So let me shift gears then. One of the things I was thinking about was related to your capital allocation and in particular repurchases as well as the M&A. So on the repurchases side, I think you said that you upped your authorization \u2013 or you have a new authorization of about $400 million. That replaces I think a $200 million authorization, but you've only used I think a little less than half of that over its life. And so I was curious if you could talk about the degree to which the $400 million is likely to be pursued opportunistically, or if it's going to be programmatic. And if there was any sort of valuation metric that you would be using to get opportunistic if that's what you chose to do? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Steve. As we've begun our share repurchase program, we are programmatic about it. We're going to be consistent for the time being. Our expectation is to keep our outstanding share count flat in 2019. Our authorization for $400 million is essentially a 15-month or a 5-quarter authorization to extend it out through September of 2019, whereas previously was ending in July. But we do expect to spend the majority of that authorization. We expect to spend a higher percentage of that authorization than we did the prior authorization, which ended in July. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's helpful. And then on the M&A side, historically as you've looked to acquire companies, the main focus generally centered around land banks. And historically you and many others also focused very much on a price-to-book type valuation methodology. Was curious if you could talk about the $400 million to $600 million that you think you might be willing to spend in the upcoming year or so. If there would be anything different about that this go around? And if so, what would those differences perhaps be? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think, we're going to look at those metrics you referenced and attributes of a good land or lot position. Most importantly, we're looking at good operating teams and the people that would be joining the company. We're looking at what their particular lot supplies are, what markets they serve, whether they are in geography that we currently exist in and how we would be complementary to each other there, whether they are in a new geography. And is that a place we'd like to get into and expand our footprint? It's a lot of the same ways we've always looked at it. And most importantly bringing on good people has been consistently the thing that pays back on an acquisition year after year, are adding good people to the team. That's the most important part of the whole process for us. Because after the land bank you acquire on day one is gone, you have the people. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Got it. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Great job. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now live. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. First question, any color on July, what you're seeing from order trends? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Really just more of the same in line with our business plan and I think we're very well-positioned to finish the year out strong. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then a two-part question on California. Could you talk about what percentage of the current community count is located there, and then also just talk about land availability. You've got a couple of tough comps coming up for orders over the next two quarters and just seeing what the land availability is like to drive the neighborhoods and the order growth out there? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think in the short-term, we feel pretty good about the \u2013 the land availability is already kind of crystallized in the lots and flags for short-term sales. In terms of the longer term, California is always a challenging land market and we have teams that are very focused on positioning us to be in front of what we believe is the best part of the market, which is affordable housing, below certain price points in various submarkets. And that's what our focus has been to continue to execute against those price points and that's where we're seeing our growth coming from by and large. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And then Jay we don't disclose our community count by state or by region. However, I can assure that California is about a third of the exposure this cycle is what we had last cycle. Really by choice we've got more diverse product offerings and a more diverse footprint where we can go find acceptable and attractive returns across the entire country. So although we really like California and we're very happy with our investments there they are at a lower level this cycle compared to prior cycles. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And Jay I would tell you that within California and across our geography the travels that D.R. has had, Davis had, I've been out on the road the past six to eight weeks, we continue to see the same things. Very enthusiastic and energized sales teams and the models seeing good activity and demand in our communities and neighborhoods and the land positions that we're looking at are very strong, opportunities we have under contract, about to have under contract and are currently bringing through development or our third-party developers are bringing to market. Really excited about the position we have against a backdrop of a market that has good job growth, undersupplied in housing, still a very accommodative interest rate environment and good consumer confidence on the outlook for the economy. So we are very enthusiastic about where the market is right now. Jay McCanless - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. It sounds great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in November to share our year-end results. And to the D.R. Horton team, on behalf of D.R. and David, again we thank you for your efforts every day to continually make our company better and take care of our customers. Go deliver great fourth quarter and keep the machine driving in the next year. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time. And have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Thank you. You may begin. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R.

After this call, we will post updated supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations Section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary information includes our previously released data on changes in active selling communities and brand stratification updated to also include the data on our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margins, price stratification and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team finished the year strong. Pre-tax income for the fourth quarter increased 25% to $608 million on $4.5 billion of revenue, and our pre-tax operating margin improved 180 basis points to 13.5%. For the year, we delivered results in line with or better than the original fiscal 2018 guidance we shared at the beginning of the year, with consolidated pre-tax income increasing 29% to $2.1 billion on $16.1 billion of revenues. We closed 51,857 homes this year, an increase of 6,106 homes or 13% over last year. Our consolidated pre-tax margin for the year improved 140 basis points to 12.8% and our homebuilding return on inventory improved 360 basis points to 20.2%. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations was $1 billion in 2018, our fourth consecutive year of generating positive operating cash flows during a period when our annual revenues have doubled. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands. Sales prices for both new and existing homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years, which coupled with rising interest rates has impacted affordability and resulted in some moderation of demand for homes, particularly at higher price points. However, we continue to see good demand and a limited supply homes at affordable prices across all of our markets. And economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid. We are pleased with our current product offerings and positioning to meet demand in the current market, and we will adjust to future changes and market conditions as necessary. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share, while growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits generating strong cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With a conservative balance sheet that includes 29,700 homes in inventory and an ample supply of owned and optioned lots to support future growth, we are well-positioned as we began 2019. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Net income for the fourth quarter increased 49% to $466 million or $1.22 per diluted share, compared to $313 million or $0.82 per diluted share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter included a tax benefit of $16.1 million due to the reversal of a portion of Forestar's valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 25% to $608 million in the fourth quarter from $486 million. And homebuilding pre-tax income increased 26% to $578 million from $458 million. As previously reported, our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 9% to $4.4 billion on 14,674 homes closed, up from $4 billion on 13,165 homes closed in the year-ago quarter. Our backlog conversion rate for the fourth quarter was 89%, up from 87% a year ago. Our average closing price for the quarter was $298,500, down 3% from the prior year, primarily due to geographic mix and a 3% decrease in the average size of our homes closed, which reflects our efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: As also previously reported, our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 11% from the year-ago quarter to 11,509 homes on a 3% decline in the average number of active selling communities. The value of homes sold during the quarter increased 10% to $3.4 billion. Our average sales price on net sales orders decreased 1% to $298,100, and our fourth quarter cancellation rate was 26%. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 21.6%, up 130 basis points from the prior-year quarter. 70 basis points of the year-over-year increase in gross margin was due to reducing incentives, or raising sales prices in excess of cost increases, 30 basis points was from less warranty and construction defect costs, 20 basis points was from lower interest costs, and 10 basis points was from less impact from purchase accounting. Homes sales gross margin declined slightly from 21.9% in the third quarter, primarily due to the average cost of our homes increasing by more than the average selling price. We continue to focus on achieving our targeted absorptions to maximize returns in each of our communities, because a consistent pace of start, sales, and closings with the right product positioning drives both the highest returns and pre-tax profit margins. Our fiscal 2019 home sales gross margin will be determined primarily by the strength of the spring selling season. We currently expect our home sales gross margins in fiscal 2019 to range from 20% to 22%, with potential quarterly fluctuations outside of this range due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact from warranty, litigation, interest cost and purchase accounting. We will update our expectations as necessary each quarter, as we have better visibility to the spring and the full year comes in focus. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.4%, down 20 basis points from the prior-year quarter. For the full year, homebuilding SG&A improved 30 basis points to 8.6%, compared to 8.9% in 2017. As our increased revenues improved the leverage of our fixed overhead costs. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to further leverage our SG&A in 2019. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Financial services pre-tax income in the fourth quarter was $33.8 million and the pre-tax operating margin was 33.1%. For the year, financial services pre-tax income was $118 million on $375 million of revenues, representing a 31.4% pre-tax operating margin. 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operation and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 43% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 49% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 44% in the prior-year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We ended the year with 29,700 homes in inventory 16,400 of our total homes were unsold, of which 4,000 were completed which is down slightly from last year. Compared to year ago, we have 13% more total homes in inventory putting us in a very strong position to start 2019. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1 billion, of which $615 million was to replenish finished lots and land and $432 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.8 billion in lots, land and development. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We are making good progress on increasing the option portion of our land and lot pipeline and believe we can continue to increase our option lots over the next few years, while maintaining our number of owned lots relatively flat with current levels. At September 30, our land and lot portfolio consisted of 289,000 lots, of which 125,000 or 43% are owned and 164,000 or 57% are controlled through option contracts. 35,000 of our total owned lots are finished and 82,000 of our option lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We have increased our option lot position by 40,000 lots from a year ago. And we plan to increase our option lots further by expanding our relationships with lot developers across the country and continuing to support the expansion of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform. Our balanced and well-positioned lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage. Mike? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot development company now operating in 24 markets in 14 states. At September 30, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 20,100 lots, of which 1,600 are finished. 13,600 of Forestar's lots are under contract with D.R. Horton, or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement between our two companies. Forestar delivered 1,279 lots and generated $109 million of revenue for the 12 months ended September 30. Our growth expectations for Forestar are consistent with what we've shared on prior calls. Forestar's still on track to grow annual deliveries to approximately 10,000 lots, generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue in fiscal 2020. We expect Forestar to be consistently profitable with future pre-tax margins of at least 10%. These expectations are for Forestar's standalone results. Forestar is making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar obtained a three-year $380 million unsecured bank credit facility and completed the filing of the self-registration statement, which is now effective. Forestar still plans to access the capital markets in fiscal 2019 to provide additional capital for long-term growth. However, Forestar's current liquidity, capital base and lot position are sufficient to support its fiscal 2019 and 2020 planned growth in lot deliveries and revenues. Forestar's separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is targeting a long-term net debt-to-capital ratio of 40% or less. D.R. Horton's alignment with Forestar is advancing our strategy of increasing access to option lot positions and enhancing our operational efficiency and homebuilding returns. We're excited about Forestar's growing operating platform and the value this relationship will create over the long-term for both D.R. Horton and Forestar shareholders. Bill? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: At September 30, our homebuilding liquidity totaled $2.3 billion, consisting of $1.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 260 basis points from a year ago to 21.4%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at fiscal year-end was $2.4 billion and we have a total of $500 million of senior notes that mature in March 2019, which we will likely repay from cash flow at maturity. Our consolidated cash flow from operations was $239 million during the fourth quarter and $545 million for the full year. Excluding Forestar, our fiscal 2018 cash flow from operations totaled $875 million, exceeding our publicly-stated $800 million target. Fiscal 2018 homebuilding cash flow from operations was $1 billion. During the September quarter, we paid cash dividends of $47.1 million and we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock for $52.6 million. We ended the year with a shareholders' equity balance of $9 billion and book value per share increased 16% from year ago to $23.88. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2019, our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.15 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $225 million to our shareholders in fiscal 2019. And our remaining stock repurchase authorization for fiscal 2019 is $376 million. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings growth and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility. And we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company. Our top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we mentioned on our last call, we have been actively pursuing select homebuilding acquisitions across the country and we still expect to deploy $400 million to $600 million of capital for this purpose over the next few quarters. Jessica? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Looking forward for the first quarter of 2019, we expect consolidated revenues of $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 11,000 and 11,500 homes. We anticipate that our first quarter consolidated pre-tax margin will be in the range of 11.4% to 11.7%. Our full-year fiscal 2019 results will be significantly impacted by the spring selling season. Due to uncertainty based on recent market conditions, we are only providing first quarter revenue, closings, and pre-tax margin guidance at this time. However, we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit growth in fiscal 2019 subject to the strength of the spring selling season. We will update our expectations each quarter as we have better visibility to the strength. We still forecast an income tax rate for 2019 of approximately 25% and we expect our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2019 will be flat with our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2018. We also expect to generate homebuilding cash flow from operations of at least $1 billion in fiscal 2019. David? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: In closing, the strength of our team and operating platform across the country allowed us to grow our revenues 14% and our pre-tax profit is 29% while generating $1 billion of homebuilding cash flow from operations. We also improved our annual homebuilding return on inventory by 360 basis points to 20.2%. We are focused on consolidating market share, while growing both our revenue and pre-tax profits generating strong cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balance sheet, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly our outstanding experienced team across the country. We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on our 17th consecutive year as the largest builder by volume in the United States and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations in 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : Good morning you all. Good to talk to you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the impact of weather on \u2013 your 4Q hurricanes et cetera if that impacted covering the fixed portion of your COGS and SG&A? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Certainly, there was some impact from the hurricanes in September on our closings. One of the reasons, why we pre-reported our closings and at any time we fall a bit short of our plans on our revenue line, our leverage on SG&A is impacted, and I would say that, that's the primary reason why our SG&A came-in higher than we had guided for the quarter. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And we don't actually have any fixed costs in our cost of goods so the gross margin was not impacted by the hurricanes. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : So just SG&A. Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of your guidance for Q1, so a little bit below what we were looking for. So you had some delays that moved into that quarter. Is this really just a function of your expectations that backlog conversion goes down or just sort of a as you look out orders feelings softer in an environment with higher rates and higher prices? And then, can you also you talk a little bit about your incentive activity and what you're looking and planning and whether or not incentives are having sort of an elastic, there is a reaction by the consumer that's elastic to your incentive so they're buying when they see lower prices or you've seen that you have to drop prices sort of more than you thought? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: This is David. Market conditions really over the last four, five weeks have been pretty choppy. We haven't seen kind of the consistency at the flag-to-flag level that we have grown to expect. So when you are the size we are, you kind of get a sense that maybe a little momentum is slipping from the market to you. You have a hard time driving the number of sales it takes for us to grow double-digits. So I'd say, Q1, we're giving you a good picture of where we are right now. Expectation-wise, I can tell you, I believe we are positioned as well as we have ever been. Our operators out there in the field have plans to produce double-digit, and we'll see what happens. Given some kind of \u2013 any kind of market at all in the spring, I think we're going to have a great year. But right now, it's been a very few quarters where we've had to come in and release because we had given guidance and then fell a little bit short of it at the quarter. So maybe part of it's our own conservative nature up here. We don't want to put a number out there we can't hit. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: From an incentive standpoint, Carl. In the fourth quarter closings, we saw a very slight sequential tick-up in incentives from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Year-over-year, incentives were still at a lower level in the fourth quarter than they had been historically. As we move forward, as we're in a more choppy environment, as David said, community-by-community, we're working to maximize returns by community. And in some cases, if giving some incentive to increase pace or to maintain pace will improve return, we'll be doing that. And so, generally, you would expect in the choppy environment for incentives to tick-up a little bit. That's reflected in our guidance here for our margin expectations in Q1. But then, we do believe fundamentals from the economy, from demographics, from housing fundamentals especially at affordable price points, is still very solid. And so, our positioning, feeling great position for the spring selling season, but realistically right now we were not to the spring. We don't have a visibility to the spring yet. And so, that's why we're maintaining a bit of flexibility here in terms of our forward guidance, because we just don't have that visibility yet. Carl E. Reichardt - BTIG LLC : All right. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, and good morning. Just following on Carl's question a little bit. Are incentives working, are they getting people to make the decision to buy? And I guess I'm wondering a bit or is it more sticker shock are you seeing at that entry-level qualification becoming more problematic there? And just on the orders, by product you mentioned that entry-level was better. But if you could give us a little bit more detail on what you're seeing at the various price categories, if you would? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Good morning, Stephen. It's only October, so it's really kind of hard to read in too much. But it has been choppy. I would say that our affordable price point flags, we continue to see good traffic and good demand. Incentives have probably not been as heavy at those levels. Anecdotally, we're seeing that in some of the higher price points, not a huge positioning for us, less than \u2013 about a third of our closings are coming from the price point above $300,000 nationally. That buyer is probably little bit affordably stretched and taking a little bit of time to reset to a changing mortgage rate environment and some of the media conditions. We are hopeful with the midterms behind us that people can get back and focus on their lives, and we'll be moving forward. But a lot of that is really going to play itself out over the next three months. And we're excited to get to the Super Bowl, not because we're Cowboys fans necessarily, but because that's typically when the selling season kicks off. And so, that's really what we think we're going to see. And right now, it's been choppy, as we said. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And the price point really varies from market to market. But very generally speaking, Texas across to Florida up into the Carolinas, if you can put a house on the ground for a sales price under $300,000, we still see very robust demand. The further West market, call it, under $400,000, once again very generally speaking submarkets have different dynamics, but generally speaking under $400,000 in the West. So a lot of the new flags we have come to market that we are behind on some of those legs getting opened are focused on those price points. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. And then, along those lines, you really haven't had any community growth over the last three years; it's all been absorption growth. You're still pivoting toward that entry-level, which I assume your absorptions will improve this year also. But as you look forward in 2019 and 2020, to me it looks like you've got to get some community growth going to reach that double-digit type of growth rates. Just what are you all expecting there, and am I thinking about it the right way? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: You exactly \u2013 are thinking about exactly right. And we've been frankly planning for community count to be more stable or slightly growing for the past 18 months. We got two dynamics in play. One, our communities are running at faster absorption than we probably expected. And so, we were closing out of communities faster. And then, frankly, it's taking us longer than we anticipated to get communities open. And we had continue to respond to the challenges we face and try to adjust our business plan to reflect the realities that we face in getting communities through planning, through approvals and through development. But it has taken us longer to get the new ones open and the ones that are open are selling at faster clips than we probably anticipated. So it's a function of two things on the community counts. We would expect to see community counts stabilize and trend up in 2019. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And we have the lot to show that it's going to happen. David mentioned our option lot position is up 40,000 lots from a year ago. So that is the direction the communities will come over time. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And, Stephen, we did believe we would be growing community count last year and really just couldn't get the communities online. So that is certainly in the plan for 2019. Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess it's in terms of potential acquisitions, David, you mentioned. Are you seeing a greater willingness for some of the smaller competitors that come to table now? And I guess secondarily, if you do pursue acquisitions, it seems like they would be kind of tuck-in type deals. And it wouldn't necessarily be a straying from the asset light thesis. Is that correct? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think you're going to pretty much see a continuation of what we have been doing. We are very interested in the culture and the ability to bring these companies into our company. So the great big deals, heavy lot deals probably don't make a lot of sense to us right now. I can tell you the deals that were closed on a very, very good companies, very good culture. People that I think will fit well within our company. So we'll see if we can get them done. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: John... John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Yeah, go ahead. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. Willingness of potential buyers. I'll tell you is the one that we're close on today, are ones that we've been talking with for quite some time and working with for quite some time. But we would expect that going forward to the extent that there is a little more inconsistency in the market. We would probably see \u2013 expect to see some buyers or some potential sellers have a bit more willingness to sell going forward. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Bill mentioned we've been talking to these guys for quite some time. We really are serious about the cultural fit. So it is a courtship and the typical deals probably two years from the time we start to when we close on what we're working on right now. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're not going to rush to the alter, okay? John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is it the shift away from becoming \u2013 using Forestar to become more asset light or is it just part of strategies be? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No. This fits right in with that \u2013 this has to do with market consolidation. In a couple instances getting a platform in a new market. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Growing our platform in existing market, giving us more places to invest with Forestar. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No, no. We are on track with our overall option lot growth, trying to become less reliant on self-developed land and lots. So, that's not going to change. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then maybe just following up on that. In terms of the capital raise out of Forestar, I mean there's, obviously, been market volatility and Forestar's stock has pulled in a bit here. Has that affected your views on the timing of potential equity raise? And I know you mentioned that Forestar is pretty well capitalized, but it does feel like the best time to raise capital, but you really don't need it. So any comments on that would be appreciated. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sure, John. This year \u2013 this past year, the effort has been to begin building the platform at Forestar. And fortunately, Forestar was very liquid, it still is. Had a lot of cash on the balance sheet at the date of acquisition, have been \u2013 has sold some of their legacy assets over the course of the last year, raised a lot of capital and is still on a very liquid position here at September, 30, made a lot of progress on the capital structure standpoint, getting the banks' credit facility in at $380 million capacity provides significant capital flexibility there to Forestar as well, and so very pleased with their positioning. All along, any plans for public capital raising either in the debt or the equity markets, it would be subject to market conditions and timing. Forestar is working to be in position to raise capital in fiscal 2019 as the plan has been all along. And the timing of that will be dependent on when we feel like the best market windows are. Fortunately, Forestar is in a very good position today with their capital, with their lot position to drive the growth targets that we've been talking about for fiscal 2019 and 2020 without raising additional capital. However, their plan is still to raise capital in fiscal 2019. If we were to go-to-market today, I do agree with you, the best time to raise capital is when you don't need it and they don't need it right now. But if we were to go-to-market today we would likely go to the debt market, given just where the equity markets have been recently. But the long-term plan for Forestar does still include both equity and debt and when market conditions are favorable for equity; equity is definitely part of the plan. John Lovallo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Thanks a lot, guys. Good job in the quarter. Just wanted to ask a little bit about your guide and the decision not to give the full-year guide. I know you talked about the uncertainty in the market and wanting to wait until the spring selling season. And so, in that regard, I wanted to ask about your 1Q guide. You gave us the pre-tax margin, you talked about gross margin for the full-year next year 20% to 22%. But you said there could be volatility outside of that range. In 1Q, given your pre-tax guidance would seem like it might be a quarter where you could go outside of that range. And so, I just want to make sure we're thinking about that right. Is it your belief that the margin in the 1Q for gross margin would be at or below that 20% range? Is that kind of what we should be thinking about? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No, Steve. When we look at that consolidated pre-tax profit margin range that incorporated our thought of 20% to 22% being a range. And 20% would be a pretty dramatic move from where we are today. So we wouldn't expect that level of choppiness in our gross margin as we move from quarter-to-quarter. But we do believe is we move throughout the year until we see the spring, we don't ultimately know what gross margins will look like for the full year. So we wanted to give a slightly wider band than what we gave, say, a quarter or two ago. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Okay. Yeah. That's encouraging. Thanks for that clarity. And then the second question relates, just sort of generally, to the market environment and your \u2013 this asset allocation decisions. In particular, I'm wondering about land spend, so it was kind of running about 24% of rev this quarter and this past year. Again, given the uncertainty in the market and your decision to sort of wait until the spring selling season to give you sort of a good heads up on where the market's going to be going, I was curious if we should expect land spend to similarly be put a bit on hold here in the first six months of the fiscal year, your fiscal year, accordingly. And then also, with respect to options, can you give us a sense for how takedown prices are typically negotiated in your options? Are they set and fixed at the time you strike the option? Or they're more flexible? And what percent of the purchase price your deposits typically constitute in aggregate right now? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Let me \u2013 this is David. Let me speak to the land spend positioning. Right now, it's my personal belief that we're going to continue to see double-digit growth in 2019. And we are continuing to position for that double-digit growth. What we've seen so far in October is \u2013 when we start putting numbers together, the range of possibilities becomes so broad and so lighted, it's meaningless to even put it out there. So, our look is at Q1 \u2013 and I believe any way that we're going to have a good year and we are going to continue to position to that. Now when we get into the spring, if this choppiness that we're seeing now turns into \u2013 continues or gets worse, then yes, our land spend, every spend is going to significantly curtail. But right now, today, we're not giving up on the year. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We don't ever make any drastic business decisions in October. October to December is always the seasonally slowest time of the year. And so we really want to wait and see what the spring looks like before we make any big business plan decisions. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And then with your question as to the option pricing, those prices are generally struck at the time the option is entered into, typically, there's an opening price for the initial takedowns. Oftentimes, there is a fixed-rate escalator that will start running from the initial takedown until all the lots are taken down. Not in every case, sometimes it's there maybe in a small minority of option contracts or maybe some adjustment based upon pricing achieved with the house. That's pretty rare these days. I believe the aggregate earns money deposit today is about 6% to remaining purchase price. So that's sort of a \u2013 and again that's a collection of a lot of lot purchase contracts. So those are some generalizations and averages, but that's kind of what's out there guiding us. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Mike you said 6% of remaining purchase price just to be clear, so that include these deposit you've already put down and then you got another 6%? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: No. That's \u2013 so the 6% is what we have, we have put on deposit... David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Total at-risk. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: ...or the future lot of businesses. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : Okay, got it. Perfect, got it. Perfect. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Sorry. Stephen Kim - Evercore ISI : No, no. No, that was my confusion. Thank you very much, guys. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Thank you. I heard the commentary about the strength of demand in the two-thirds of your business that's $300,000 and under. It sounds like you're talking about the demand has softened in the upper-third of your business and upper price points. Would love to hear a little bit more color if that's indeed what you're seeing? And then if you've seen anything changed within that two-thirds of your business that's in the more entry price point piece of the market? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think \u2013 you would think at the higher-price points maybe interest rates impact the buyers less. But what we're seeing debt to income issues when you get over that $300,000 in most of our markets. It just seems like that buyer is having a more difficult time getting qualified. And housing valuations have been so good for so long that when people go out and take a look at a house, they could \u2013 two years ago, they can afford a much nicer house than they can today. So, there is kind of that sticker shock process going on. And as far as demand at under $300,000, there's just not very much out there in any of the market. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Supply. So not much supply. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Supply. Yes. Not much \u2013 the demand is there, there's not much supply. So, even though demand may be restricted by affordability, there are still more buyers out there than there are that can afford it than there is product. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And financing availability is not the issue for those buyers. It really is the supply. We continue to see our credit metrics improve even on our Express buyers that utilize our mortgage company today, their FICO scores continue to risen to this quarter at 710 compared to just our company average of 720. And our cumulative loan to value on those is actually ticked down slightly to 90, almost right in line with our company average. So financing is there. There's just not homes on the ground for those price points for those buyers. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And certainly, we're seeing at the higher price points there is more supply available relative to the demand that's there. So the buyers have more choice whether it's an existing homes or other new homes. At the more affordable price points where communities are established and the sales process, the mortgage process is there to support that first-time homebuyer. That's where we're focused on opening flags and bringing those products to market. I think about half of our mortgage company's closing this last quarter were, too, first-time homebuyers. And so we're really pleased with what we're seeing there and that buyer is coming into the market. They, call it, 10 years out of school now. They may have come out of school in 2008, not the greatest time to start your career. And they've hit a point in their lives where they are ready for home ownership. And we're very excited to see them coming into the sales offices. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: So let me just ask the question a little bit more directly. Is the change that you're seeing in the upper-third of your business, or you also seen a change in demand in the entry first-time piece of your business? That's what I guess I'm trying to figure out. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Primarily at the upper-end. That's where we primarily have been seeing weakness. And then, as David said, last four, five, six weeks, it's generally been choppy, but we would not necessarily say that's an indicator of any change in demand at the lower price points. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And maybe to answer this a little more directly. The person that came in three or four months ago at the below $300,000 price point, they could buy a 2,200 square-foot house. Today, for that same payment, they're looking at maybe a 2,000, 1,800, 1,900 square-foot house. They still want a house, they still need a house. But their expectation of \u2013 we've seen this every time there has been an increase in rates over a relatively short period amount of time. There's an adjustment time, where the reality and expectation had to realign. So again, the alternatives are very, very limited. So if they're going to buy a house, the demand is there I guess is I'm trying to say. That it does create choppiness and it does create maybe a less consistence sales pace. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So it really comes down to us as positioning. Every community, every market, positioning our homes, positioning the floor plans that we offer to make sure that they're at that affordable payment for that core buyer in that market. And that means it's a smaller house or buyer is going to select more of our smaller floor plan that's what we expect to see. In fact, we started seeing that this quarter. Our average square footage on our homes closed this quarter was down 3%. And so we're positioning ourselves to make sure that there's a home for that buyer that has had to reset their expectations. Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Hey, guys. Good morning. So, obviously, your business model you mentioned previously, it really thrives when you have a consistent pace of start, sales and closings. In last few years, all of those have been very consistent. So, I guess, the question is, if the choppiness on the sales front continues, at what point do you actually adjust that start pace? Because right now, David, you mentioned you're still optimistic for double-digit growth for 2019. So is it not until the spring where you start to really adjust your start pace, or could it happen potentially sooner than that if the next few months are also choppy? David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We really do look at sales week to week to week, project by project. So we have not made any adjustments so far. My expectation is in the last couple of years we have seen, especially after the 2016 election, we saw sales pickup early the spring market started in December. Not sure that I am 100% bought in. We're going to see that same thing this year. But I can tell you, it would not surprise me. And again, like Jessica says, we've seen about five or six weeks so far this year. That's not a lot. But to answer your question, yes, we won't wait till April to adjust our start. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And, Alan, I'd also like to point out that at the end of September we had 4,000 completed homes that were unsold, which is actually less than we had ending fiscal 2017. So we're still seeing the projects working at the community level and we are monitoring week-to-week, community-to-community, our teams do great job of staying on top of that. They have a plan for what they believe in is happening in their sub markets and continuing to execute against that. I mean we are taking market inputs and looking at the sales pace in every community to look at the sales to adjust the starts. But we watch it very closely, and we still believe we have positioned and are positioning for 2019. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And our Division Presidents are going to make sure they're starting homes in the right communities. That's what they're adjusting on a day-to-day and week-to-week basis is putting the starts on the ground in the communities where we're seeing either more consistent or more robust demand to meet the sales and demand that's out there. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. I appreciate all that color. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We talk a lot about the right home on the right lot at the right price. So... Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Okay, thank you for that. So second question, if I could. Just obviously it seems like there's a little bit more turmoil in the market today. We've heard from other builders as well. You guys I think have been running at a cost inflation rate somewhere in the low-single digit range. So I guess as you're having conversations with your trades, how have those been going? Are you starting to see any relief there? Obviously, lumbers come down. But is it a situation where cost inflation could actually slow here over the next several quarters given the softness in demand? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think we'll be seeing that Alan. I think we will be seeing some cost pressures alleviate a bit, which will be \u2013 what has been a headwind certainly has been the tight labor market for construction. And the lumber, I think we'll see that lumber become a bit of a tailwind probably into our late second quarter, third quarter deliveries or second quarter and third quarter deliveries, late first quarter potentially. And then, we will see I think a little bit of labor moderate as others perhaps adjust their starts. Alan Ratner - Zelman & Associates: Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just around can you talk to what you're seeing from a competitive perspective in the sense of maybe some of your private peers? Are you seeing them adjust at a similar rate to what's been going on in the last few weeks? Or how are they thinking about the setup into the spring? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's hard to generalize what any one individual private homebuilder or any other builders thinking about. But generally, and this is from talking with a lot of private builders, their focus is generally not on returns. Their focus is generally margin house-to-house-to-house, and so they maybe a bit slower to respond to market conditions and others. They are also typically more focused on building homes to order rather than building homes to market demand and providing product that's kind of more readily available for the entry-level buyer. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, given some of the changes that we're seeing in the market is there any change to how you're thinking about your capital allocation especially maybe as it relates to your share repurchase activity? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We've taken the balanced approach. Thus far, we have ample liquidity and flexibility to really still grow our business as well as continue to pay down debt and provide return to shareholders through our dividends and our share repurchases. We have been incrementally increasing our share repurchases, and we expect incrementally increase them further this year to offset our share price or our share creep, so they will keep our outstanding share count at least flat, no more than flat this year. But we do have room to be opportunistic. With our authorization we have room to be opportunistic there as well and so we will balance the opportunities in our potential share repurchases alongside our other opportunities as well. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And do plan to continue to reduce our debt as we said in the scripted comments that $500 million maturity this March. We believe that the lower interest costs in our business really are competitive advantage, and as we continue to pay down debt that's just one more tailwind to help us offset cost pressures in our gross margin. Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the detail. Looking at the first quarter guidance and appreciate, obviously, all builders are kind of dealing with that choppiness. But the closings growth of, I believe the range is 2% to 7% and you talked about October been choppy. Are we to think about order growth in a similar type of mid-single-digit range? And obviously you don't kind of guide to order growth per say. But given the choppiness in the market, obviously there's been an amount of reduction in sales pace, and I presume that it takes a while to get the community count growth up and running. Should I be thinking or should we be thinking that perhaps orders were down a little bit in October? And it might be in the low to mid-single-digit range for the quarter? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's fair Mike. As we said, we don't comment our guide specifically on sales. But as we've said several times on the call about the choppiness we've seen this fall and we are behind our business plan, albeit only one month into the year. And as we said, we continue to see the good demand at affordable price points. So we're very well positioned to continue to go out sell the industry and whatever the market is out there to continue to consolidate share. But with that closings guidance that would tell you that, yeah, we're behind our plan one-month into the year so far. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. No, I appreciate that. I guess just following on to that. I mean, last cycle, you guys were pretty aggressive in being kind of a leader in terms of any types of incentive adjustments or price adjustments and pretty strong in terms of being able to, let's say, get cash flow and turnover your inventory as the market was turning. At this point, though given the nature of where we're seasonally, it sounds like you're still holding off any more aggressive type of wholesale adjustments to price, or incentives obviously still making the smaller adjustments as needed. But is that the right way to think about it in terms of obviously still expecting a 20% to 22% margin for the year and anymore type of aggressive adjustments to the pricing strategy? We probably wouldn't expect to occur this quarter more as the spring comes together? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I think you're right Mike. We're one-month into our fiscal year. We are in the slowest seasonal period of the time, historically slowest seasonal period of the time. And also occurring in that period of time, we saw interest rates move up that the buyers are dealing with. The buyers dealt with a lot of media coverage that was crazy. And so, we're not going to make any \u2013 as Jessica said before \u2013 any significant business decisions based upon this is the small step into the year we are so far. But we will continue to monitor every community at the same operating strategy we have. What pace price combination drives the best returns for each one of those communities, and the market is going to help us make those decisions. Our fiscal 2019 margins in the range, we've given it's largely the spring selling season that's going to determine what those margins end up being. So we are very pleased with the positioning the teams have done in terms of building out their sales and construction and customer care teams, and the lot positions and the homes we have in inventory and that's going to be the execution in the spring against that's going to determine where fiscal 2019 comes out. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're going to know a lot more in January than we know today. Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jade Rahmani with KBW. Please proceed with your question. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Good morning, this is actually Ryan Tomasello on for Jade. Just for the industry overall, I was wondering if you have an internal forecast of where you expect the new home sales and housing starts to be in 2019 for the overall market? Do you expect the market to see growth overall next year? And obviously, this wouldn't be read as a direct correlation to your results given your internal growth targets? Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We honestly utilize our bank research coverage for the economist. We don't have an economist on staff that doesn't fit into our SG&A budget very nicely. But we're looking at it all of the same things, most of the people on the line probably are. And clearly, demographics are favorable the economy seems to be on very good footing. And so really as we see it today, we would believe there could be growth in the industry next year, particularly at affordable price points. So, we'll adjust as we need to, to meet market conditions. But yes, I think we would expect if builders are putting the right-priced houses on the ground. There should be growth in the industry as a whole. And whatever that growth ultimately is that D.R. Horton would outpace that. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the land market I was wondering what you're seeing there in terms of any changes in competition given the slowdown we're seeing or any changes in pricing? And as a follow-up to that if you see any risk of increased impairments and then your land purchase earlier this year or last year as you adjust the product mix to fit the buyer base? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: We're not seeing much change in sort of the land market conditions of where we have been. And we certainly don't expect any impairments or impairment risk on recent purchases based on where market conditions are today. In spite we talk about them being choppy, we're still not any kind of alarmed relative to valuations of our projects. Ryan Tomasello - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please proceed with your question. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning. In your prepared remarks, Mike, I think you touched on the decrease in home size by 3%. Can you maybe speak to what percentage of the portfolio you're seeing this? And is there a particular price point that those decreases are coming in? Michael J. Murray - D.R. Horton, Inc.: I don't know they have exactly driven in by brand or price stratification where those are in front of me \u2013 I know Jessica's flipping through. So if we don't have it here we'll try to give it back to you. In the aggregate it's kind of where that number is that's going to be reflective across the whole thing but the majority of the lion share of our portfolio is within the D.R. Horton brand and the Express brand. So that's what's going to be driving any kind of an average \u2013 overall average movement. And it has come down a little bit as we've been starting houses in line with what we believe our buyers payments, tolerances are and then the buyers are making some of those selections to gravitate to those smaller part \u2013 smaller homes. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Yeah. The 3% square footage decline was a year-over-year metrics. So this isn't apples-to-apples to that but I do have our sequential Q3 versus Q4 by brand in front of me. And our square-footage across all four brands declined slightly sequentially, which would be right along with what we've been saying for a while now as interest rates rise, people who need or want to buy house, just buy a little less house. Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: So that combined with a little bit more of a mix shift towards more first-time buyers would generally be buying a smaller house as well would be the other component of it. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Right. That make sense. And then in your cash flow statement just noticed that you guys started breaking out multifamily expenditures this quarter, I believe, for the first time. Is there something to call out there? Or and then maybe thoughts on how you are approaching the market going forward? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: You know we have \u2013 I think we've mentioned it a couple of different times. We've been in the process really for the last 2 to 2.5 years of starting out internally, the capability to build multifamily communities. We've done this on land that our homebuilding operations already owned. And so it's a very synergistic business with our homebuilding business. In the past we've typically sold of partials that were zoned for multifamily. But we have developed the capabilities to build those in house, we made very good progress on that. Currently, we have four projects actively under construction and two projects that are substantially complete. One of which is actually being marketed for sale right now. So that we've been building that \u2013 slowly internally, but it is growing. And we would expect in the coming year for it to grow a bit more and begin to see some sales of assets there as well along the way. So we felt like just in terms of our presentation, and our cash flow as it begins to grow a bit, is a small component of our business to call out that cash that would be a prudent move. So that everyone can see. You have better visibility to that portion of our cash. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: And more accurately be able to calculate a free cash flow number, which I think is what most people do, since it has been so small, it's previously been in PP&E. So we wanted to get it out of PP&E to keep free cash flow clean. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Is there sort of a target you guys have internally to get that business to a certain point? Bill W. Wheat - D.R. Horton, Inc.: It's incrementally growing, but again we have six projects going, we've got projects planned to start in the coming year. And we do believe that it's a very synergistic business to our business and there's some natural advantages that we have as with our relationships on the material side, on the land side and the synergies with our homebuilding business to build something that can create value for our shareholders over the long-term. Soham Bhonsle - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Okay, thank you. Jessica L. Hansen - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the callback over to David Auld for closing remarks. David V. Auld - D.R. Horton, Inc.: Thank you, Devon. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in January to share our first quarter results. And to the entire D.R. Horton team. Don Horton and this Executive Group, thank you for your continued hard work and incredible focus in delivering an outstanding 2018. And for insiders only, just want you to know we awarded Mr. Horton his purple shirt, last night at dinner. Have a great day. And thank you. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica, please go ahead. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our Web site at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post an investor presentation and supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary data relates to our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid first quarter of 2019. Our consolidated revenues increased 6% to $3.5 billion. Pre-tax income was $376 million and our pre-tax profit margin was 10.7%. For the trailing 12 months, our homebuilding return on inventory improved 230 basis points from a year ago to 19.3%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands. As we discussed on our call in early November, sales prices for both new and existing homes have increased across most of our markets over the past several years, which coupled with rising interest rates has impacted affordability and resulted in some moderation of demand for homes over the last few months, particularly at higher price points. However, we continue to see good demand and a limited supply homes at affordable prices across all of our markets. And economic fundamentals and financing availability remains solid. Our net sales orders during the first quarter increased 3% versus the last year. As we indicated on our last call, our sales in October were down from the prior year. However our sales comparison improved in November and December was a good sales month. We are pleased with our positioning of affordable product offerings for the upcoming spring selling season, and we will adjust to future changes in market conditions as necessary. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and land to support growth, we are well positioned for the remainder of 2019 and future years. Mike? Michael Murray : Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the first quarter increased 52% to $287 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $189 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. Our prior year quarter includes the impact of a higher effective tax rate primarily due to the remeasurement of the company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter was $376 million versus $391 million a year ago. And homebuilding pre-tax income was $354 million compared to $374 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 7% to $3.4 million on 11,500 homes closed, up from $3.2 billion on 10,788 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $296,600, essentially flat with the year ago quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 3% to 11,042 homes and the value of those orders was $3.2 billion, flat with the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from both the prior year quarter and sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired during the first quarter, our net sales orders increased 2% and our average number of active selling communities was flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $292,100, down 3% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 24% compared to 22% in the year ago quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 20%, down 80 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 160 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. The majority of the sequential decrease in gross margins was due to cost increases, less pricing power, higher incentives and to a lesser extent purchase accounting from our recent acquisitions. We continue to focus on achieving our targeted absorptions to maximize returns in each of our communities because we believe a consistent pace of start, sales and closings with the right product positioning drives both the highest returns and pre-tax profit margins. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2019 will be determined primarily by the strength of the spring selling season. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we currently expect our gross margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 19% to 19.5% due primarily to less pricing power and higher incentives on our first quarter sales activity as well as the impact of purchase accounting. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of our revenues was 9.5%, flat with the prior year quarter. We remain focused on managing our SG&A efficiently while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our opportunities to consolidate market share and grow over the long term. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter increased 6% to $23.6 million from $22.2 million in the prior year quarter. Financial services pre-tax profit margin for the quarter was 27.7%, up slightly from 27.4% in the prior year. 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 54% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time homebuyers represented 50% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 43% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike? Michael Murray : We ended the first quarter with 33,700 homes in inventory, 20,100 of our total homes were unsold with 15,200 in various stages of construction and 4,900 completed. Our increased inventory homes puts us in a great position for the spring selling season in fiscal 2019. We manage our home starts at a community level each week and we will make adjustments to our starts as necessary throughout the spring to align our inventory levels with our sales pace in each community. Our homebuilding investments in lots, land and development during the first quarter totaled $1.1 billion, of which $440 million was for finished lots, $200 million was for land and $450 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. David? David Auld : We increased the option portion of our land and lot pipeline again this quarter. At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of 309,400 lots of which 128,500 or 42% were owned and 180,900 or 58% were controlled through option contracts. 37,000 of our total owned lots are finished and 89,000 of our option lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We have increased our option lot position by 47,000 lots from a year ago. And we plan to increase our option lots further by expanding our relationships with lot developers across the country and continuing to support the expansion of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform. Our balanced and well-positioned lot portfolio is a strong competitive advantage. Mike? Michael Murray : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot development company now operating in 35 markets across 16 states. At December 31, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 25,600 lots, of which 2,400 are finished. 18,800 of Forestar's lots are under contract with D.R. Horton, or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement between our two companies. Forestar\u2019s revenues in the first quarter increased 25% to $385 million compared to the prior year quarter, $38.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. And pre-tax income increased 23% to $4.9 million. During the first quarter, Forestar delivered 518 lots and is on track to grow its annual deliveries to 4,000 lots generating $300 million to $350 million of revenue in fiscal 2019 and to approximately 10,000 lots generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue in fiscal 2020. We expect Forestar to be consistently profitable with pre-tax profit margins of approximately 10% by fiscal 2020. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s stand-alone results. Forestar is also making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. Forestar's current liquidity, capital base and lot position are sufficient to support its fiscal 2019 and 2020 planned growth in lot deliveries and revenues. Forestar\u2019s current liquidity of $531 million and a debt to capital ratio of only 14%. Subject to market conditions, Forestar plans to access the capital markets in fiscal 2019 to provide additional capital for long-term growth. Forestar will post an updated presentation to the Events & Presentation section of their Investor Web site at investor.forestar.com at the conclusion of this call. This presentation describes Forestar\u2019s unique business model and its significant growth and value creation opportunity. We encourage investors to review it. Bill? Bill Wheat : At December 31, our homebuilding liquidity included $538 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $901 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 270 basis points from a year ago to 23.2%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion and we have $500 million of senior notes maturing in March, which we plan to repay at maturity for liquidity and cash flow. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $56 million and we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock for $140.6 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at quarter end was $234.9 million. At December 31, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $9.1 billion and book value per share was $24.45, up 17% from a year ago. David? David Auld : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet's strength, liquidity, earnings and cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility. And we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company. Our continued top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding leverage and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have been actively pursuing select acquisitions across the country to expand and enhance our operational platform. During the first quarter, we purchased the homebuilding operations of three private builders for approximately $321 million. In November, we acquired Westport Homes, a top five builder by volume in Indianapolis and Columbus which are both top 50 U.S. housing markets. And in December we entered Iowa by acquiring Classic Builders, the largest builder in Des Moines and we enhanced our market position in Raleigh, North Carolina by acquiring Terramor Homes. We\u2019ve welcomed the Westport, Classic and Terramor teams to the D.R. Horton family. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, based on current market conditions, we expect our number of homes closed in the second quarter will be in the range of 12,800 to 13,300 homes. We expect our second quarter consolidated revenues to be in a range of $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion. And as we stated earlier, we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be in the range of 19% to 19.5% resulting in a lower consolidated pre-tax profit margin in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our revenues and profit margins for the full year of fiscal 2019 will be determined primarily by the strength of the upcoming spring season, so we are not providing full year revenue or margin guidance at this time. We expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 25% for the remainder of this year. We also continue to expect our homebuilding segment to generate cash flow from operations of at least $1 billion in fiscal 2019. And we expect our outstanding share count to remain relatively flat with the current level for the remainder of the year. David? David Auld : In closing, my results reflect the strength of our long-tenured and well-established operating platforms across the country. We are striving to be the leading builder in America in each of our markets and to expand our industry leading market share. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits generating strong cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. We are well positioned to do so with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly our outstanding experienced team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations throughout 2019. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. First question, Dave, are your comments on November kind of sales pace improving and December being a pretty solid environment was clearly encouraging. Have you seen improving traffic and overall business trends kind of continuing to January particularly given the rate pullback? David Auld : John, we have. We\u2019re feeling better and better as we progress into the spring selling season. Week-to-week we\u2019re seeing a little better sales, little better traffic. And really the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve been happy. John Lovallo : Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to hear. It looks like you\u2019ve bought back more stock in the first quarter than you guys did in all of 2018 and it seems like the blended price was around 34 and change, which is obviously very well timed. Should we read this as you\u2019re expressing confidence not only in your business and in strategy, but perhaps in the fact that the first quarter was kind of the market bottom here and things are looking potentially to improve? Bill Wheat : Yes, John, this is Bill. I think it\u2019s just a continuation of our strategy. We\u2019re remaining flexible and staying in a flexible position. And repurchases is part of our capital allocation strategy. I expect we want to be consistent over the long term in our program but when opportunities exists when our valuation is down in the stock, we\u2019re going to maintain flexibility to be opportunistic. And I would view the level this quarter as clearly an opportunistic buy, but we do expect to be a consistent buyer going forward. But the levels will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter depending on what the valuation of the stock is. David Auld : John, just to build on that a little bit, we are very confident. The job growth numbers, the overall economy comes down to positioning and having the right house in front of the people that are out there trying to buy. So we\u2019re working very hard on that. And we do not believe that this is a great demise of housing. We believe that it\u2019s going to be a good year. John Lovallo : Good stuff, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Stephen East : Thank you and good morning, everybody. Maybe just following on that first question a little bit, David. As you look at what\u2019s happening, what\u2019s going on, getting a little bit better, a little bit better, how much of that is in your mind incremental incentives and you all or your peers meeting the market more versus the buyer behavior really stepping in and you all not needing to ramp incentives, say, in January or even December and January? David Auld : Steve, I feel like there was more pressure on the incentive side to try to get the pace reestablished in November than it was in December and even less so in January. It really \u2013 to me it comes down to taking advantage of the traffic that coming in the door. And as more traffic comes in, you got to be a little less aggressive to hit the targets. Because we\u2019ve been planning a long time, but we really do look at it subdivision by subdivision, market by market against a plan that incorporates sale starts and closings to maximize some kind of return. Jessica Hansen : We did guide to the lower gross margin particularly related to the choppiness in Q1, so the 19 to 19.5 for Q2 is because of what we saw in the market in Q1. But we are optimistic that we\u2019ll find a good pace in the spring and begin to see some level of margin stability as we move forward throughout the year. David Auld : I can tell you we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve seen a month-over-month or year-over-year down number in a long time. Stephen East : Okay, all right, got you. David Auld : It was a tough -- Stephen East : And in the end that was the only one, okay. We\u2019ve been hearing of layoffs with several of your public competitors. One, I guess, are you all seeing that out in the market? And are you seeing them take a different stance on going to market and say you all are doing \u2013 being aggressive with the same incentives and moving on pace? Are you seeing them try to go to market differently and are you seeing them back off land deals at all? Michael Murray : I would say that we\u2019ve heard of the same \u2013 some of the same layoffs. And we\u2019re looking to meet the market and the market\u2019s defined by the buyer behavior and it\u2019s defined by other competitor behaviors as well. I don\u2019t think anybody is as well positioned as our teams have got us into both in terms of product affordability, the communities we have that are now open and the inventory position we have coming in right now. So hard to generalize where we see it, but we empower our local teams to make market decisions every day and to drive their neighborhoods to the right pace to improve the returns on them. And the last part of your question I think was dealing with the land deals. We probably have seen a couple \u2013 anecdotally you hear of a couple of land deals coming back around. Maybe it\u2019s a little more than normal. It\u2019s hard to exactly gauge that. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s measured very rigorously. But we do see some opportunity that come back around a bit. Stephen East : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate it. Again because I know this is what everybody is really focused on, I wanted to delve a little bit if I could into the tone of the market and your stance towards that strategically and also the impact on margins. So to frame it a little bit, David, when we met up a month or so ago I think, maybe a little bit over a month ago, you had indicated that you weren\u2019t as a firm looking to get particularly aggressive on incentives until you had had January sort of under your belt. January\u2019s not quite under your belt but your commentary suggest that things have improved to the point where perhaps the level of incentives that you had contemplated you might need to do in the fourth quarter or your first quarter, the fourth calendar quarter, is not what you\u2019re expecting you\u2019re going to need to be able to do. So I just want to make sure first of all that you have sort of held back in terms of some of the incentives that you were thinking you might have had to do relative to what you had previously thought. And then also if you could remind us where various incentives show up on the income statement? So like some of those actions you do like, whether it\u2019d be rate buy downs or whether it be closing costs or things like that, landscaping, just which ones show up in the gross margin and which ones may show up elsewhere? Jessica Hansen : To start with the latter and then I\u2019m sure David will also chime in on incentives and margins and his commentary on that, Steve, but any incentive we offer essentially shows up in our home sales gross margins. So whether it be a price reduction, which would impact revenue or any of the myriad of things you just looked at, those would all flow through cost of sales. Stephen Kim : Excellent. Okay. Thank you. David Auld : And I can tell you, Stephen, the market is performing I would say pretty much as we expected, maybe a little better given the first quarter. So it is \u2013 you got to get on budget, you got to keep the community on plan. When you get on budget, it\u2019s easier to maintain it than it is to create it. Creating momentum is always more difficult than maintaining it. So it\u2019s my expectation that it\u2019s going to be a little easier to get people on contract through this spring if it continues. The big debate is a lot of things happen in the market as far as politically, as far as internationally. We take the rates rising in conjunction with cost rising created affordability issues. And coming out of a higher fiscal 2018 and it\u2019s kind of the combination of two people paused or became choppier, whatever term you want to call it. They weren\u2019t buying houses. So we\u2019ve seen the market come back. If you talk to Don Horton he\u2019d tell you it\u2019s better than he thought it was going to be. I can tell you it\u2019s pretty much what I expected. But I\u2019m always been more optimistic than Don Horton. I don\u2019t know if that helps or not. Jessica Hansen : The very short answer is the very early signs, because it is still early, the very early signs for spring are good. Stephen Kim : Sound great. Thank you. And then second question I had relates to the political environment to some degree. The shutdown obviously has been lingering on for a while now. There\u2019s been some thought that some delayed paychecks might have caused some folks who on the margin would have been looking to get into their first home might make it difficult for them to do that and that maybe once this thing is resolved and you get some back pay hitting and maybe also with some tax refunds hitting as well that later in the spring where the spring starts to take shape you might actually have a little bit of boost. So I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on what you see from a cash flow perspective hitting some of these affected people as well as the tax refunds, whether or not you think it\u2019s reasonable to think that it might be a little bit of a boost a little later on in the year? Jessica Hansen : I think that might be a reasonable take but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re counting on or really have expectations for as it relates to the current government shutdown. Fortunately that\u2019s been relatively minimal on our business and we\u2019re keeping a close eye on the guidance day-to-day. But really it\u2019s impacted USDA which for us is a very low-single digit percentage of our business, it\u2019s less than 2% generally of what we\u2019ve been running including this quarter. So our mortgage company is doing a great job of managing our backlog accordingly. But other than USDA and as you mentioned government employees who aren\u2019t getting a paycheck today, there\u2019s still ways to work around that from an income verification and the different types of things you have to do. Could it be a modest help down the road? Maybe, but not something we\u2019re really worried about right now or relying on being a big uptick. David Auld : I will say, Stephen, government\u2019s a huge part of the economy now and the shutdown is going to have ripple effects throughout all the industries. And yes, you just look at consumer confidence and when you have lack of ability to work together at that level, you see confidence coming down which is a big part of our \u2013 that\u2019s a big part of our business. People got to be confident to buy a home. Again, it just adds to the kind of uncertainty about committing to a number out there in the future today. But if it gets settled, I think it will be a very positive impact or when it gets settled. Stephen Kim : All right, great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live. Carl Reichardt : Good morning, guys. I wondered \u2013 you guys are in 80 plus markets now I think. Could you talk a little bit maybe about the two or three markets that produced the most positive surprise or strength this last quarter from an orders perspective and maybe two or three that were softer than what you thought? And I\u2019d just be curious as to whether or not you feel like across your product mix the trends are effectively the same to the quarter in terms of the improvement? David Auld : Yes. Carl, as far as markets go, we\u2019re still very, very happy. We have the concentration assets in Texas, Florida and the Carolinas. Those have been solid markets. They continue to be solid markets. And don\u2019t see any change in the future really. Upside surprise, markets have seemed to be performing better from our standpoint. I\u2019ll tell you the Utah market has been somewhat of a pleasant surprise. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time positioning there. We\u2019ve got a long term with the company, very focused operator running that market and he has positioned us incredibly well. So very happy with that. It\u2019s probably going to be a record year for us in Utah this year. California continues to be soft. Chicago continues to be soft. I do think we are very well positioned in both California and in Chicago with the markets we got. And our operators there I think are doing are better job than at any time I\u2019ve ever seen in this company. So again, it\u2019s people, product and price and you get them aligned and you can have good markets, you can have bad markets. Our goal is to outperform any market. So that\u2019s what we focus on. That\u2019s what we get up every day trying to do. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thanks, David. And then since I asked two in one, I\u2019ll just repeat the second one which is I\u2019m just curious when you\u2019re looking across your mix set and you have expressed you\u2019ve got the other brands, the traditional Horton and then maybe especially Emerald brand. Is the traffic performance in orders as you work through the quarter you called out weakness at the higher end and I\u2019m just curious if you could expand on that if the strength that you\u2019ve seen is really coming out of the most affordable stuff which is certainly what we\u2019d expect? Michael Murray : We did see good traffic. I think some of the rate spike that we saw in our first quarter did affect some of the entry level buyers. So like 50% of our deliveries were to entry-level buyers, but I think there was a bit of an adjustment period for those buyers with that rate change. And then certainly the moderation was helpful there. I think a lot of our \u2013 over the past years we\u2019ve been focused on even in our Horton brand positioning that product to make it very affordable relative to the alternatives in the marketplace and provide efficiencies to the buyer with that. And so we saw probably a good performance in the Horton brand relative to Express. Carl Reichardt : Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Michael Murray : Thank you, Carl. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : Hi, guys. Good morning. Nice job taking share in the choppy demand environment. I guess a question on the margin. I think last quarter, Jessica, you kind of implied that for margins to get down to this 20% level would be a pretty dramatic move I think is the word you used based on where you were running previously. And you got there and now it sounds like the next quarter might be a bit below that. So I guess you sound very positive on January which I think is encouraging. But if you wanted to take the flipside to that where maybe this is a bit of a temporary bump from the rate pullback, as you think about that price versus pace dynamic, how low are you willing to take that margin in order to hit the desired absorption pace that you target in your communities? Jessica Hansen : We continue to focus first on returns, so we\u2019re going to continue to make adjustments community-by-community to drive the best possible return and the margin really is just what that drives based on hitting the best return on a community-by-community level. So we do still think of maintaining our consistent production and sales pace is going to drive not only the best returns but the best margins and particularly pre-tax margins. So we did end up at the low end of our range. I would tell you that October and November and December even though November and December got better, still were weaker than we expected. And so we did give up some margins to find that sales pace again, as David indicated. But typically once you can get back to a consistent sales pace that\u2019s the best way to find stability in your gross margin. Bill Wheat : Alan, I\u2019d also like to point out that typically roughly a third to better of our closings in any one quarter were sales in that quarter. So we\u2019re very quickly reacting with pricing to the marketplace to maintain our pace and our return focus at every community level. In our first calendar quarter, we probably had a large percentage of the homes closed were started late spring or early summer when lumber was just some of the highest prices we ever seen. So those cost pressures we\u2019re cycling through against a time when we were kind of marking our homes to real-time market to maintain a pace. And those two things were a fair bit of headwind to margin. And so we did see a rather dramatic move. But because so much of our deliveries in any one quarter are reflective of market conditions in that quarter, sales market conditions, we will see as we talked about in the past volatility in margins that can move rather quickly. So we expect going forward we\u2019re going to see some of that cost headwind fall away. We\u2019ll have more of our closings being delivered from starts at a time when lumber was less expensive. So that coupled with the sales trends and the pacing that we\u2019re looking at it in every community now week-to-week, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic we should see some stabilization in the margins. Alan Ratner : Understood. I appreciate that and I think it definitely is a benefit of the sales strategy in the model. Second question when I look at your land portfolio and obviously the mix shift towards more option has benefits on the balance sheet, but also in a softer demand environment I guess at some point it does give you the ability to go back to the landowners and attempt to renegotiate some of those contracts. So are you at the level in any markets or any communities at this point? And if so, how have those conversations being going? David Auld : I will say we are at the level every quarter of every year irrespective of whatever the market is. Our goal is to enhance the value of our shares for our shareholders and we do that by making money and being very conscious of the fact that capital is a precious commodity. Alan Ratner : So from that standpoint then, David, I guess the question is are you seeing land sellers, I don\u2019t know if capitulate is the right word, but are you seeing them a bit more receptive given the \u2013 it seem like a softer fourth quarter for sure or calendar fourth quarter to renegotiate or are they still pretty set in their pricing? David Auld : The guys that probably are most vulnerable to that are the people that put contracted land to our competitors and our competitors are not in a position to take close it. We are \u2013 I\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re punitive to somebody coming back with a deal they didn\u2019t sell us the first time, but we are punitive to sellers coming back with \u2013 really didn\u2019t sell us work on. Alan Ratner : Got it. David Auld : I can tell you it\u2019s a choppy \u2013 this is not a market where you\u2019re going to see huge revaluations. It\u2019s choppy. I think the way we positioned our focus on operations over the last \u2013 since the downturn, started coming out of the downturn has put us at a position to operate pretty well, outperform the industry in pretty much any market. And I\u2019m not going to tell you we\u2019re excited about a market that could be correcting, but we\u2019re certainly not scared of it. So we\u2019re going to continue to build, close houses and drive returns across the country. Alan Ratner : All right. Good luck, guys. Michael Murray : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Would love to hear you expand a little bit more on the moving parts in gross margin, specifically the optimism about what you\u2019ve seen recently and the 2Q gross margin year-over-year contraction I think is worse than in this current quarter. I know there\u2019s obviously some timing of what\u2019s going on in the business, but if you\u2019ll just expand within the moving parts in gross margin and how we should think about that into 2Q and then into the second half of the year? Bill Wheat : Sure and some of this information will be in our supplementary data that we\u2019ll post as well. But if you look at the first line of that margin analysis that you see there, that is kind of what we would call our core gross margin. Sequentially from the September quarter to the December quarter, that was down 140 basis points. So that was the lion share of the change in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis that was down 90 basis points. And then as you kind of move through the pieces, interest and property taxes sequentially was actually an improvement of 10 basis points, year-over-year was 20. Warranty and litigation sequentially was flat, year-over-year was an improvement of 10 basis points. And then purchase accounting is the final piece of that. Sequentially that was a 30 basis point negative impact on our margin with the acquisitions we did during the quarter; year-over-year that was a 20 basis point negative impact. So it\u2019s still mainly in the core business related to the sales activity in Q1 as we work to meet the market and get ourselves paced back on track. And then that\u2019s really what\u2019s \u2013 the Q1 sales activity in our current backlog that\u2019s a result of that is really what\u2019s driving our guide for Q2 to be down a bit further from Q1. But then our recent sales activity I\u2019d say in December and then what we\u2019ve seen thus far in January would indicate that we\u2019re much better back on track. And if we can continue that momentum, we do see signs that we should be able to see some stabilization in our margins and we certainly have some costs tailwinds that will start to kick in as well late in our fiscal Q2 and into Q3 that gives us some cautious optimism that we\u2019ll see stability and hopefully some opportunity to start regaining some of the margin that we\u2019ve given late in the last quarter or two. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly, I know that you\u2019re continuing to defer a bit on full year guidance, but is it up 10 year [ph] of delivery still in the making here? Bill Wheat : We wouldn\u2019t rule it out. We\u2019re not providing guidance yet because it\u2019s too early. Until we get into the spring, sales in February, March, April will be a big driver of it. But we\u2019re guiding to 4% to 8% closings growth in Q2. And so if we see good momentum in sales and we certainly have the inventory to go deliver as well, we wouldn\u2019t rule that out. David Auld : Eric, we\u2019re positioned to accomplish that. Operator : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. You line is now live. Nishu Sood : Thank you. I wanted to come back to the share buybacks. Obviously there was a nice pickup, an opportunistic pickup in your December quarter. But thinking back on how you had been framing your share buyback strategy, you had said earlier that your plan is to just offset dilution and if I look at the activity in the fourth quarter I can look at it as just offsetting dilution even though it was a pick up. But from your comments earlier it sounds like you\u2019re willing to go beyond just offsetting dilution. So I just wanted to kind of come back to that. Are you now saying that you will be willing to on a continual basis here go past just offsetting dilution or is that still your kind of main way you\u2019re going to approach it? Bill Wheat : Nishu, our base plan for the longer term is to continue to offset dilution. However, we are keeping the flexibility to remain opportunistic. And so with the buy in the first quarter, that\u2019s certainly brought our share count down slightly as we will see further dilution in future quarters and we want to continue to be consistent in our repurchases to offset that. But the comment we made around remaining flat with the December share count level would keep us flat from this point going forward. Nishu Sood : Got you, okay. And on Forestar, obviously continued nice pickup in the spread of operations out of Forestar; a number of states and markets that you\u2019re operating in there. How does this choppiness in demand affect your approach there? Does it give you the opportunity to \u2013 since you still feel good about the market for '19 to maybe be a little bit more aggressive, there are probably more opportunities out there or does it give you some pause in what kind of portfolio you\u2019ll build out of there? And also on the capital raising side, how does it affect your plans there? Michael Murray : I think from the market perspective we\u2019re not seeing any of the sales choppiness we experienced earlier in our fourth quarter and our first quarter, the calendar fourth quarter, impacting any of the operating decisions at Forestar. Our underwriting guidelines for each of our communities and each of our investments whether it\u2019s on the Forestar side or the Horton side are reflective of current market conditions. So to the extent that that\u2019s impacting valuation or term discussions, that\u2019s just going to be incorporated in as normal course of business. But if there is extended choppiness and it creates other folks pulling back in their opportunities, then it may create some ability for Forestar to participate more broadly in more deals. But we\u2019re not seeing that broadly yet nor are we counting on that in the growth. We still feel really good about Forestar\u2019s ability to create its growth \u2013 obtain its growth objectives in the current market conditions what we\u2019re seeing out there every day. With regard to the capital raise, it\u2019s somewhat market condition dependent. We feel good about the capital position Forestar is in today. It has adequate capital to support its growth plans for '19 and '20. And the market conditions will dictate largely when we access the market for longer term growth capital. Nishu Sood : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, everybody. David Auld : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Zener : So I get why you\u2019re trying to build steadily. It helps for a variety of reasons. Your total units in inventory, which I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re highlighting that, is up about 19% year-over-year, obviously above orders. So that\u2019s what I want to focus on. I know you guys do a lot of spec, but if you look at your 2Q closing range, it does imply a lower percentage of your units that are construction closing. And related to that I want to ask you, some of that\u2019s obviously coming out of backlog, some of that\u2019s obviously spec which I think you\u2019re being judicious around. So what is the margin differential? So I think last year historically in the 2Q you have about 40% plus of orders were actually closing. So what are we seeing right now in terms of the margin spread from backlog and spec? Michael Murray : From backlog and spec, so from a build job pre-order versus a spec? Kenneth Zener : Right. Sort of homes that you\u2019re for instance usually close about 40% plus in 2Q from spec. What is \u2013 that\u2019s not backlog by definition. So what is that kind of spread that you\u2019re seeing right now? Because I think and it sounds like when you say meet the market, you\u2019re talking about both backlog but more importantly homes that you\u2019re closing into the quarter. Could you highlight if that\u2019s a 200 basis point spread or 100 because it has to do with how many units you have under construction? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Typically about a 200 basis point differential between call it a pre-sell or a build job versus a standing spec. Now then it also depends on the age of the spec. So the way you could see even more of a gross margin differential is if we had a completed spec that has been sitting and unsold. But the vast majority for a period of time \u2013 the vast majority of what we\u2019re selling and closing in the same quarter is very timely and so it\u2019s only about that 200 basis point differential. Kenneth Zener : Okay. Bill Wheat : Ken, your comment about the closings in Q2 or our projected closings in Q2 being a lower percentage of inventory, I would say our positioning going into the spring is much stronger this year. The last several years we had really been trying to catch up with community openings, getting our starts out. And I\u2019d say our positioning with our community openings and our starts in our homes and inventory is better this year than we\u2019ve seen in several years. And so we\u2019re in great position to really be able to drive sales, drive growth in the spring with our inventory position today. Kenneth Zener : But I guess because you guys don\u2019t give community count, when you\u2019re saying you\u2019re better positioned if you can maybe clarify? So I see you\u2019re adjusted for your acquisitions, your total units are up about 19% year-over-year, but you\u2019re saying you\u2019re happy with that despite community count you\u2019re saying flat year-over-year sequentially. So you\u2019ve actually intentionally increased your units \u2013 your spec per community and that\u2019s actually where you want to be right now. You were trying to play catch up is what you\u2019re saying. So it\u2019s not excessive in your view? David Auld : For the last couple of years going into the spring selling season we had planned on having more houses coming out of the ground and more lots available to start houses on. This year we are better positioned to hit the plan than we have been at any point in the last four, five, six years. So I do think \u2013 when Bill talks about positioning, we are very happy with the way we\u2019re positioned and believe that we will be able to drive absorptions and generate very high returns. Jessica Hansen : And that\u2019s analysis community by community, homes and finished lots that can still deliver a home on this year. It\u2019s better positioned than each of the last few years. David Auld : And if you look at our ASP, there is still a tremendous amount of demand at the price points we\u2019re delivering homes into. And there is some competition but it is significantly less on competition at $100,000 to $150,000 higher. Kenneth Zener : Right. And I guess if I could make my one last question, it\u2019s not as complicated but if the pricing is fine at the low end which everybody says I get it, how much do you think pricing is off at the high end? Does that have to go down like 3% or is it like 10%? Considering you\u2019re giving us this relative demand, how much is price off at that high end? Thank you. David Auld : Let me take this. We\u2019re all kind of looking at each other with -- Bill Wheat : Blank empty look. I think Ken let me \u2013 to look at what pricing needs to adjust for us to give a number that it needs to be X%, Y% or Z%, we just don\u2019t know. What we see is what our sales demand is, what our net sales \u2013 our teams are able to go out to the market and meet the market with the sales to hit pace, and they\u2019re working with customers, working with buyers and writing contracts and then delivering those homes. And we\u2019re watching the margin that\u2019s coming in on those sales contracts and the margin that\u2019s coming in on the closings. And they\u2019re meeting it. And we\u2019re not necessarily trying to globally measure from an index price or any other price for the community. It\u2019s what is that price house by house, what is that margin house by house and we focus on this business one home, one lot, one family at a time. And it kind of rolls up to what it is and it is \u2013 it can me a fairly dynamic number, because a large percentage of our deliveries in any quarter reflect the market conditions of that quarter. So we saw that in our first fiscal quarter, we saw a change in the base level, lot level, house margin. Kenneth Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question today is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Michael Rehaut : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. David Auld : Good morning, Mike. Michael Rehaut : Good morning, Dave. First, I just wanted to get a little bit more insight I guess into the November, December, January trends and I appreciate the detail there so far. I think what everyone\u2019s trying to triangulate is your performance versus the underlying market because clearly if you go back to the last downturn, Horton was kind of a first mover. Often times as the market softened, you were typically a little bit more aggressive off the bat and it\u2019s consistent with your approach today in terms of volume and returns and meeting the market. So I just wanted to get a sense, number one, what are you seeing there in terms of your performance versus the market vis-\u00e0-vis fair gains? Do you feel like the underlying market is a little bit softer than what you\u2019ve been able to put together in terms of results? And secondly, when you talk about December being good and January being better, particularly on the comments of January, is that more of just the typical sequential improvement for the spring or are you talking about sales pace actually growing or accelerating on a year-over-year basis? Jessica Hansen : So, Mike, it is a sequential improvement particularly in January which is what we would normally see with traditional seasonality. But to be specific about November and December, our October sales were down on a year-over-year basis. Our November and December sales were both up on a year-over-year basis. Then as we move into January what we\u2019ve referred to is really just traditional seasonality in terms of week to week improvement in sales. It\u2019s too early still. We\u2019ve got a lot of January left to give a full read on what January looks like. Michael Rehaut : Okay. And in terms of the fair gain question as you kind of see it over the last two or three months, any sense for how you performed versus the underlying markets? Bill Wheat : Mike, we would expect that we performed better than the underlying markets. That\u2019s our goal every day and that\u2019s been kind of our performance over the past several years is to continue to grow market share. And for our teams they\u2019re very competitive and they like to win. Michael Rehaut : Great. Bill Wheat : But we don\u2019t have any empirical data to that today. Jessica Hansen : We\u2019ll see as everyone reports, just like you do over the coming weeks. Michael Rehaut : Right. And just lastly on the gross margin front, you had talked about hoping to see some stabilization there with the potential tailwind in perhaps the back half of the year for lower lumber. At the same time obviously you\u2019ve been buying land over the last two, three years. I would suspect that there\u2019s still somewhat of a rising cost basis from a land perspective in your inventory books. So when we talk about stabilization, are we to think of the upcoming second quarter low 19 range as something where all else equal given that sales pace has come a little bit back in response to the incentives. That\u2019s kind of the new base and even \u2013 I guess the real question is stabilization at those levels and would a lower lumber kind of just offset higher land cost in the back half. Bill Wheat : Mike, as we sit here today and based on the recent sales trends we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re hopeful \u2013 we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we are going to see some stability in our margin and the cost relief we\u2019ll get on the lumber ruling for our closings in the latter half of the year should be a part of that. In terms of the land cost, we\u2019ve actually seen our finished lot cost as a percentage of our overall revenues stay relatively consistent over the last year or two. So I would say to think we have any headwinds coming in terms of our lot cost as a percentage of revenues. I think part of that reflects the fact that we\u2019re buying more and more of our lots on a finished lot basis in the current market and so that\u2019s adjusting community by community based on market conditions. Michael Rehaut : Okay. But just to be clear the stabilization we\u2019re talking about is coming off of 2Q levels. Is that fair? Bill Wheat : Yes. I think that\u2019s where we would start. And in terms of some cost relief coming and stability in sales pace, it should provide stability in margins. It starts with stability. And if we see good momentum, hopefully we would have the opportunity to improve on it. David Auld : Mike, as we\u2019ve gone through all these numbers and I keep going back and looking at the first quarter that our people put on the books, first quarter SG&A is 9.5% on operating margin at 10.7%. Those are historically incredibly strong numbers. I got to tell you I\u2019m pretty proud of our people. Michael Murray : Yes, we are focused first on returns and returns don\u2019t happen with us selling and closing houses. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to meet the market. And margin is what we solve for, but then obviously improving margins improves returns as well. So it\u2019s always a balanced community by community to drive the volume, hit the sales pace, generate the best returns we can get at the best margins we can get. Michael Rehaut : I appreciate it. Like I said, you\u2019re definitely at the Vanguard in the last downturn and it looks like you continue to be here, so congrats. Michael Murray : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. David Auld : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is with the choppiness that we have seen in the market, has that changed the appetite of some of the M&A opportunities that you see out there? Are sellers maybe a bit more willing to sort of get out before things perhaps get a little softer? Michael Murray : I think we\u2019ll probably see a fair bit of that and people are engaging where they are in their markets and where they are in their horizons and think it may not get a whole lot better going forward potentially, and so they might want to take a little off the table. And it may affect bringing some of the bid/ask spreads a little bit. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then my second question is just in terms of some of the raw materials, the inputs for labor, have you seen any changes there? How should we think certainly about the lumber prices coming down as we move through the year and anything else that\u2019s in there? Jessica Hansen : Nothing real noticeable other than the lumber cost that we have already talked about that will still be a headwind in Q2 but then should be more of a tailwind going forward. You typically hear us talk about our stick and brick costs on a per square footage basis. So on a year-over-year basis, our stick and brick costs were up just a little over 4% and our revenues were just slightly behind that, which was some of our margin issue. Sequentially, our revenues per square foot were essentially flat and our stick and brick costs were up about 2%. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live. Jade Rahmani : Thanks very much. Any change in investor purchases of homes in your communities, any opportunistic purchases as a result of the moderation in sales? Jessica Hansen : No. We track that very closely as it\u2019s something that did cause a big impact last cycle that we\u2019re very cognizant of. So we have limited sales to investors that are essentially one-off. In individual communities, we don\u2019t do any big bulk sales transactions to investors. We really want to focus on the for-sale, live-in-the-house part of the business and to keep our communities in good shape. Jade Rahmani : And can you give the percentage of closings that came from spec? Jessica Hansen : Almost 80% this quarter I believe. It traditionally runs right in the 70% to 80% range very tightly. There\u2019s some seasonality to it. Jade Rahmani : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today. I look forward to speaking to you again in April to share our second quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, thank you for a solid first quarter and a strong start to 2019. It\u2019s your focus and hard work that has put us where we are. We appreciate it, we thank you for it and expect it to continue. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings. And welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead, Jessica. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Before we get started, today\u2019s call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there\u2019s no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post an investor presentation and supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentation section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary data relates to our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, product mix and our mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I am pleased to be joined by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid second quarter of 2019. Our consolidated revenues increased 9% to $4.1 billion, pre-tax income was $463 million and our pre-tax profit margin was 11.2%. The spring selling season is going well, as our net sales orders increased 52% sequentially and 6% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton\u2019s scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands. As we have discussed on our last two calls, affordability concerns have caused some moderation in demand for homes since late 2018, particularly at higher price points. However, this spring we have continued to see a good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, while economic fundamentals and financing availability remains solid. We are pleased with our product positioning and our people sales trends to-date. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position, with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and land to support growth, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2019 and future years. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the second quarter of both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 was $351 million. Net income per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was $0.93, up from $0.91 last year due to our lower share count this year. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter was $463 million and our homebuilding pre-tax income was $400 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 8% to $4 billion on 13,480 homes closed, up from $3.7 billion on 12,281 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $295,300, down 1% from the prior year due to product mix and the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, both reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 6% to 16,805 homes and the value of those orders was $4.9 billion, up from $4.7 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 8% from the prior year and 4% sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired earlier this year, our second quarter net sales orders increased 3% and our average number of active selling communities increased 2% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $294,100, down 2% from the prior year. The cancelation rate for the second quarter was 19%, consistent with the same quarter last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 19.3%, down 150 basis points from the second quarter last year and down 70 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. This sequential decrease in gross margin was in line with our expectations and was due to cost increases, less pricing power and higher incentives. Based on today\u2019s market conditions and expected cost moderation, we currently expect our home sales gross margin to be flat or increase slightly sequentially in the third quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9% compared to 8.8% in the prior-year quarter. The increase in our homebuilding SG&A percentage from the prior-year was mainly from higher employee costs due in part to compensation accruals related to increases in our stock price and the public equity markets this quarter. Year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A expense was 9.2% of revenues compared to 9.1% last year. We remain focused on managing our SG&A efficiently while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our opportunities to increase market share over the long-term. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the second quarter with 32,100 homes in inventory excluding models. 17,800 of our homes were unsold with 12,500 in various stages of construction, and 5,300 completed. Our current inventory of homes puts us in a solid position to achieve fiscal 2019 closings guidance we provided in our press release this morning. We manage our home starts at a community level and we adjust our starts if necessary to align inventory levels with current sales pace in each community. Our homebuilding investments in lots, land and development during the second quarter totaled $740 million of which $340 million was for land and finished lots and $400 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remain consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash development within 24 months. David? David Auld : We increased the portion of our land and lot pipeline that we control through land purchase contracts again this quarter. At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of 316,400 lots of which 120,900 or 38% were owned and 195,500 or 62% were controlled. 35,000 of our total owned lots are finished and 103,000 of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We plan to continue to increase our lot position, being developed by third parties, by supporting the expansion of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and continuing to expand our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our lot portfolio with an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points is a strong competitive advantage. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial Services pre-tax income in the second quarter increased 8% to $34 million from $31.4 million in the prior year. Financial services pre-tax profit margin for the quarter was 33.5% up from 33.1% in the prior year. 98% of our mortgage companies loan originations during quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 56% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage company volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 53% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 45% in the prior year, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike? Mike Murray : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer now operating in 41 markets across 17 states. At March 31st, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 31,400 lots, of which 3,600 are finished, 21,700 of Forestar\u2019s lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to right of first offer under the master Supply Agreement between our two companies. Forestar\u2019s revenues in the second quarter increased 189% to $65.4 million over the prior year quarter and pre-tax income increased 257% to $16.4 million. During the six months ended March 31st, Forestar delivered 1,066 lots and is still on track to grow its fiscal 2019 deliveries to 4,000 lots, generating $300 million to $350 million of revenue in its fiscal 2020 deliveries to approximately 10,000 lots, generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue. Forestar is a profitable business today and we expect Forestar to remain profitable throughout a significant growth period, with expected pre-tax margins of approximately 10% by fiscal 2021. These expectations are Forestar\u2019s stand-alone results. Forestar is making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support a significant growth plans. Forestar\u2019s liquidity, capital base and lot position at March 31st are sufficient to support its fiscal 2019 and 2020 planned growth and lot deliveries and revenues. To support investments for revenue growth in 2021 and beyond, earlier this month, Forestar issued $350 million of 8% senior notes due in 2024. Subject to market conditions, Forestar expects to opportunistically access the equity and debt capital markets if necessary to provide additional capital for long-term growth, while managing their balance sheet at a net leverage ratio of 40% or less. Forestar will host an updated presentation to the Events and Presentation section of their Investor site at investor.forestar.com at the conclusion of this call. This presentation describes Forestar\u2019s unique lot manufacturing business model and its significant growth and value creation opportunity. We encourage investors to review it. David? David Auld : DHI Communities is our multi-family rental company focused on suburban garden-style apartments and currently operates primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. DHI Communities has four projects under active construction and two projects that were substantially complete at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its first apartment project of 432 units located in McKinney, Texas for $73.4 million and recognized a gain on sale of $29.3 million. DHI Communities total assets were $170 million at March 31st and it is reported as part of other business in our second financials. Bill? Bill Wheat : At March 31st, our $1 billion of homebuilding liquidity was comprised of $557 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $447 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 130 basis points from a year ago to 22.9%. During quarter, we repaid $500 million of senior notes at their maturity and the balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion. We have $500 million of senior note maturities due in the next 12 months. During quarter we paid cash dividends of $56 million. We also repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $75.6 million bringing our total repurchases for the first half of the year to 6.1 million shares and $216.2 million. Our remaining stock repurchase authorization at quarter end was $159.3 million. At March 31st, our stockholder\u2019s equity was $9.4 billion and book value per share was $25.09, up 16% from a year ago. David? David Auld : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet\u2019s strength, earnings, and annual cash flow generation are increasing our flexibility and we plan to utilize our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the company. Our continued top cash flow priorities are to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding leverage and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward and as outlined in our press release this morning, we are providing our current expectations for the full year of fiscal 2019 based on today\u2019s market conditions and our results for the first half of the year. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of between $16.7 billion and $17 billion and to close approximately 55,000 to 56,000 homes. We are forecasting a full year fiscal 2019 income tax rate of approximately 24.5%. We continue to expect to generate homebuilding cash flow from operations of at least $1 billion for the full fiscal year and we expect our outstanding share count to be down slightly at the end of the year compared to the end of fiscal 2018. For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in a range of $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion and to close approximately 14,500 to 15,000 homes during the quarter. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 19.3% to 19.8% and our homebuilding SG&A in the third quarter to be approximately 8.2% to 8.3%. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our long-tenured and well-established operating platform across the country. We are striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets and to expand our industry leading market share. We are focused on consolidating market share, while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns, and maintain a flexible financial position. We are well-positioned to do so, with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offerings across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced team across the country. We thank the entire D.R. Horton team for their continued focus and hard work. We look forward to working together to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Stephen East from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Stephen East : Yeah. Thank you, and good morning, everybody. David, maybe I will start with the progression through the quarter. What you all were seeing with traffic trends with order progression and probably maybe most importantly the incentive progression through the quarter and if you can shed any light on what you are seeing in April with those. David Auld : Stephen, I\u2019d say it was kind of a traditional seasonality. It got a little better in January, a little better in February, a little better in March. The market is \u00fb it seems pretty solid out there. It\u2019s -- and April is pretty much as we expected. So I would tell you kind of a pleasant surprise given our first quarter, so we are happy with what we are seeing out there right now. Stephen East : Okay. If you look at the incentives progression either with what you all were doing or what you think you were seeing in the market, is that also unwinding as you move through the months? David Auld : We have seen it unwinding, yes, incentives are certainly lower today than they were first quarter, and that progressively, we have been able to hit our sales targets with a little less incentive each month. Stephen East : Okay. All right. David Auld : Okay. Stephen East : Fair enough. And then the other thing. Go ahead? David Auld : I said pretty much as we expected. Yeah. Stephen East : Okay. And then the other thing, just looking at your capital allocation moving forward, your option lots up to 62%, I know you don\u2019t like, 60% was your target that you stood by, but we are already past that. So maybe a compound question here. One, if you can talk about how you expect that to progress and then looking at your capital allocation moving forward, you do have some debt coming due. Your net debt to total cap is probably a little bit or a whole lot higher than D.R. wants it, et cetera. How do you look at allocating your capital? David Auld : I have got to tell you, Stephen, we are kind of maintaining as much flexibility as we possibly can, in Don Horton\u2019s world, any debt is bad debt, I can tell you this from a return base and capital priorities, some debt is not a terrible thing. Bill? Bill Wheat : And Stephen, with respect to the option percentage, certainly, we are pleased with the progress we are making. We expect to continue to progress from here, but we are not going to put out a set target necessarily, but we do expect to continue to increase the percentage of our lots that are controlled through purchase contracts and that\u2019s giving us more flexibility. What that sets up is the potential to increase our cash flow from operations over the next few years and with that increased cash flow that gives us more flexibility for our capital allocation. We have been able to fold in share repurchases into our allocation over the last year-and-a-half or so and pleased with the progress we have made there and expect to continue to keep that as an important part of our allocation. Stephen East : All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. David Auld : Good morning. Carl Reichardt : I wanted to ask about Texas. So it\u2019s been sort of a quarter of your business, 20%, 25%, I think, for a bit, and your orders were slightly down flattish there. We have seen some of your peers report better numbers out of Texas. Some of them have talked about it being effectively the best market they have got in terms of turnover. So it looks like you lost some share this quarter just going orders. So can you talk a little bit, David, about what\u2019s happened in that particular market for you particularly over the last quarter given your strength there historically? David Auld : Carl, I can tell you Texas is a great market. We are seeing solid performance across all of our divisions. We are coming off very tough comp of second quarter last year and we are dominant market share in the four major cities, so it\u2019s -- we are very happy with Texas. We like what our operators are doing out there. And the truth is our targeted growth in Texas is probably low-single digits to mid single-digit for the year, and we think we are well-positioned to hit that. Jessica Hansen : We have got a lot of markets across the rest of the country, Carl, where we don\u2019t have that kind of dominant position, and that\u2019s where a lot of our growth is coming from this year, while we maintain or continue to gradually improve our share in Texas. Carl Reichardt : Right. Okay. I appreciate that, Jessica, thank you. And then, in terms of community count, you had an increase this quarter, you are starting to grow those again. Can you give us sort of a sense as you look maybe over the next year or so how you are thinking about the expansion of outlet count ex-acquisitions, is that something we can expect to accelerate beyond just acquisitions? Thanks. David Auld : I wouldn\u2019t say accelerate. We have markets where we are not dominant and our focus is to be in a significant, if not dominant, market position in every market. So a lot of growth opportunities. A flag in Texas typically helps at a much higher pace than flags in other markets. So it\u2019s balanced, it\u2019s disciplined and it\u2019s something we are focused on continuing. Jessica Hansen : We have a great lot position that we will continue to replenish our communities, so we wouldn\u2019t probably anticipate anything more than flat to slightly up organically going forward. Carl Reichardt : Great. Thanks Jessica. Thanks all. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions as well. First question is your outlook for a flat sequential gross margin at the low end of the range at least would seem to imply a fairly meaningful year-over-year step-down in core margin versus what you saw in the first quarter, despite, I guess, should be a lumber benefit for one and an improving market. Could you just help us understand some of the moving pieces there? Bill Wheat : I think you see, John, that we are expecting some benefit from the lumber softening we saw last year as those closings come through and we start to deliver those. We have started and will continue to deliver those. But the market did take a step backwards in our first quarter and the pricing incentive levels that we are pushing off of right now are going to allow us to be a little stronger in the margin but it\u2019s difficult to gauge the full extent of how much and when any of those concessions we gave up in the fall are going to be back and showing up in closing margins. Trying to take a measured pace to looking at margin. John Lovallo : Got you. And then, I guess, just more broadly speaking in terms of just the overall environment. I mean, are you guys fairly confident that things are reaccelerating at this point, I mean, would you expect growth to kind of trend higher as the year progresses here for D.R. Horton and for the industry itself? David Auld : Re-accelerating, that\u2019s a tough question to answer today. A lot depends on interest rates. I can tell you we are very happy with the spring market so far. We are going to know a lot more as it rolls along, if it continues through May and early June, it\u2019s going to be a great year. Bill Wheat : We would look and see that some of the demand that was displaced in the fall will probably elongate as selling season this year in the spring and into early summer as those buyers have returned and more continue to come to the market, so it\u2019s still a great time to buy a home. Jessica Hansen : Our annual guide for closings and for the 6% to 8% increase in closing and 4% to 6% increase in our consolidated revenues, so we are a little less pricing power this year, but we have got a great housing position to go drive outsized growth as compared to the industry. John Lovallo : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. David Auld : Hi, Alan. Alan Ratner : Just on that last question on the last point, I guess, I think, if you take a step back 6% to 8% growth given how you started the year, certainly very impressive especially compared to what we have seen in the market. I know you guys have talked historically about 10% to 15% kind of where you hope to be annually, so I am just curious as the way you think about spring is unfolding you kind of put some of the softer demand in the rearview mirror. Is that still kind of the hope and the intention and kind of the thought based on what you are seeing right now in the market that you could eventually get back to that 10% to 15% annualized growth or have those plans changed for some reason? David Auld : It\u2019s always possible. We try to be conservative, disciplined in what we say, and then do what we say we are going to do. So it depends on the market. As we get through the spring, we will take a look at it and then how this year ends up, we will take a look at next year. I can tell you, our operators all have the Horton DNA in them and they want to drive growth, so. Jessica Hansen : We are continuing to focus on returns though and so if you look at what we did experience in the late fall and as we are moving into this spring, there\u2019s a balance between price and pace and we are striking that on an individual community level to drive the best possible return. And in today\u2019s market, that may mean that 6% to 8% growth rate rather than the 10% to 15% rate to continue to maintain or improve upon our overall returns. Alan Ratner : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Jessica. And then, second, you gave some stats on the mortgage business and the profitability this quarter was actually quite impressive, given some of the challenges in the mortgage space today. I was hoping you could just comment quickly on what you are seeing regarding the changes out of FHA. I know your average metrics are very favorable, but there\u2019s a piece of your business that goes outside of the mortgage business. So has there been any fallout or any impact at all from the adjustments FHA made in March? Bill Wheat : We have not seen material impact in the business at all. At the margin, there are certainly individual customers that may have to wait and work on a different loan program, or are getting delayed in their process, but we have not seen any significant impact whatsoever. Alan Ratner : Got it. One final one if I could sneak it in. Jessica, I might have missed it but there was there a pre-tax margin guidance for the full year, I think you typically give that. Jessica Hansen : No. There was not. We just gave gross margin and SG&A guidance for the third quarter. Alan Ratner : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jessica. Mike Murray : We need to see the rest of the year to really guide beyond Q3 or the rest of the spring to guide beyond Q3. Jessica Hansen : We are continuing to sell and close 30% to 40% of our homes. It was actually even higher than 40% this quarter and so to get a feel for gross margin much further out than a quarter is pretty difficult. Alan Ratner : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks a lot. And just a follow on there with Alan\u2019s question on the full year profitability projection, in the past you have talked a lot about how you kind of run your business with a 20% to 22% kind of gross margin range. I am gathering from your commentary that much like the topline, historical range 10% to 15% growth isn\u2019t necessarily the dominating factor in the way you are running your business right now, but rather returns. That similarly on the gross margin side, we could see this year be a little bit below your 20% historical range and that wouldn\u2019t be inconsistent with how you are positioning yourself for the longer-term in a difficult market. I just want to make sure that I am hearing you correctly. And then, could you with respect to margins talk about the degree to which mix may be impacting your margin. Is it -- in other words, is Express still generating gross margins comparable to the company average or maybe a little better or just give us some sense about mix in terms of your margin makeup right now? David Auld : Yeah. In terms of the gross margin, yes, we are balancing pace and price, margin and volume, to generate the best returns we have. So, yes, those are levers that may move up and down within our range. I would say our longer-term range on margin has been 19% to 21%, or a little bit broader 18% to 22%. And so margin in the 19% is certainly not unusual for us and in the current market coming off the incentive levels that we had to put in place to regain momentum back in Q1, we feel good about the level that we are at and the ability to potentially start to carve some margin back going forward. In terms of the gross margin profile across our brands, we are still seeing pretty tight range in terms of margin and still seeing very good margins within our Express brand and that\u2019s still the heart of the market, where we are seeing strongest demand and the lowest supply of inventory in the marketplace, so still seeing very solid margins in Express. Stephen Kim : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then with respect to M&A, I think, you talked about maintaining a balance and disciplined approach. Recently we have seen a couple of what I would basically call asset purchases in local markets, Pulte just announced the American West and then Lennar, we understand bought level homes in Raleigh. And so, I guess, I am wondering, do you see the competition for local deals meet midsize sort of private names in local markets. Do you see that competition intensifying in the current environment, and if not, or I should say in a situation where that is actually happening, can you talk about how D.R. Horton is positioned or prepared to approach those kinds of opportunities. Do you think that this is something that you would, for instance, at this point, favor share repurchases just because of an intensifying competitive environment for M&A? David Auld : I would say, Stephen, that we look at the M&A as opportunities to add to the long-term profitability and capabilities of the D.R. Horton company overall. So where we can expand with great teams into new markets or deepening share in existing markets with great teams of people. That\u2019s our primary focus and we are frankly very selective on where we are going to get aggressive and any kind of a acquisition opportunity. Having said that, we need to continue to look at lots of opportunities and acquisitions, and we certainly think that DHI is an attractive acquisition opportunity as well for us in terms of our share buyback. You can see that as we have allocated more capital to that this fiscal year than in prior, so it\u2019s a balanced approach. Stephen Kim : Yeah. So you are kind of drawing a distinction between the way you would approach M&A in other words, being basically your personnel-oriented and talent-oriented as opposed to what we have seen from, let\u2019s say, Pulte most recently in terms of primarily being asset acquisitions, right? David Auld : It certainly is as a component of the overall acquisition, but the determining factor for us is generally going to be the people and the talent rather than simply the lot position or the lot portfolio. That is what justifies for us the effort, expense, and potential risk you have with an acquisition is the long-term playback of adding to your platform. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was just kind of the pace that you have seen over the last two months or three months, perhaps, relative to your expectations, so far as some of the other builders have reported, they have pointed to not just seasonal improvement, but a little bit of improved year-over-year trends. In other words, the year-over-year growth improving as well from January to February and to March, maybe not every month, but certainly towards the end of the quarter, and perhaps even into April. So I was curious if you could give us a sense if that year-over-year growth accelerated as well particularly on a sales pace basis. And when you talk to similarly incentives improving sequentially, obviously, they are still up year-over-year, I was wondering if that year-over-year delta on incentives perhaps has moderated as well. Jessica Hansen : Mike, we generally don\u2019t comment on individual months within a quarter in terms of the year-over-year improvement. As David said, we are very pleased with our sales pace. We did see normal seasonality as we move throughout the quarter from month to month to month, and incentives for us are always on a community-by-community basis. So we have got communities where we have been able to roll those back fully from what we have had to do in the fall and we have got some that still have some elevated incentives out there. But as we continue to move throughout the spring, we are hopeful that we can continue to dial those back in communities, where maybe we haven\u2019t been able to fully yet. David Auld : I would say we are not seeing anything outside of normal seasonality. It\u2019s been a good spring. It\u2019s been a solid spring. But we would say it\u2019s consistent with what we would expect to see in normal seasonality thus far. Michael Rehaut : Okay. So unless I am interpreting that differently, it seems like perhaps again on a year-over-year trend basis, again, I know you kind of punted on the month-to-month, but it does, it sounds like normal seasonality means that, again, unless I am reading the tea leaves of your answer a little too finally that, perhaps, it was more steady it sounds like rather than improvement. I guess, second question maybe just to zone in on a region here. Appreciate the color commentary on Texas. Another big focal point has been California, and in particular, some of the real improvements month-to-month over the last two months or three months, 4Q was pretty rough. Just wanted to get a sense again if there\u2019s been anything outside of normal seasonality or would you say that by contract anything a little bit more from an acceleration standpoint? Mike Murray : I spent the last four to six weeks traveling our California market, driving communities, very impressed with the effort execution of our teams out there. I don\u2019t think our California market is on fire by any stretch of the imagination. But I will say in my world, effort and execution is what separates us from our competitors and I was very happy with what I saw from our people. The overall market in California appears to be getting a little better. It was not good in the first quarter and there\u2019s some portions of it that had -- gives you a sense that it is coming back fairly well. We are focusing as affordable as you can be in California. I was very happy with what I saw, I will say that. Jessica Hansen : And, Mike, when we post our supplemental data after the call, you will see we have been talking a lot about in the west part of our issue had just been getting the communities online and this is the first quarter in several quarters our west region community count on average is up 5% year-over-year and it\u2019s even up 4% sequentially. So we are getting those new communities online and we are very excited about the product that we are bringing to market. Bill Wheat : And I think you will see those new communities contribute more meaningful in Q3 and Q4 to sales than in the first month \u00fb the first quarter of their opening. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks very much. See you in a few weeks. David Auld : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. Jessica Hansen : Good morning. David Auld : Hi, Ken. Ken Zener : So could you just start with your spec completed number? Bill Wheat : It\u2019s 5,300. Ken Zener : Okay. And I apologize, just kind of going through calls this morning. But you gave guidance for 14,500 to 15,000, is that correct for 3Q? Jessica Hansen : That\u2019s correct. Bill Wheat : That\u2019s right. Jessica Hansen : Yeah. Ken Zener : So let me ask you this question. If you look at your units in inventory, it appears that your conversion rate of closing is decelerating versus kind of the past, which would imply and that\u2019s been happening in recent quarters, so it\u2019s one of two things, obviously, there\u2019s fair demand or your inventory on average is just a little bit younger. Is it because your -- why is that, is it because you are building more specs and you just tend to have more younger inventory versus something that was more backlog-ish and what exactly was the intra-quarter order of closings, please? Bill Wheat : Intra-quarter closings would be those that we sold and closed in the same quarter. I believe it was over 40%... Jessica Hansen : Yes. Bill Wheat : \u2026in the second quarter. Looking at the age of our inventory, the number of unsold homes that we have in inventory completed over six months was the same at March 31, 2019 as it was at March 31, 2018. So the inventory is still young, to use your word. And looking at that, we did have some I don\u2019t want to use the W word, but we did have some events this quarter that effected some production. So we do have some of those completions coming a little bit later, from the winter and into the early spring. Ken Zener : Yeah. How -- okay. Let me look at this another way. I mean, obviously, you guys are issuing guidance, because the last six months are pretty much already growing vertical. How do you think about your spec position as it relates to backlog? So, obviously, you want to achieve even flow, which you do that by reducing your December quarter units in inventory as much as you did historically and others do which helps you with market share. But how do you think about how you are running spec versus what you are seeing in terms of orders. I mean, you always going to keep basically your units under construction at a 2 :1 ratio backlog? Is that your approach in general or how should we think about how that spec will turn relative to the lower industry growth rate that we are seeing? Mike Murray : Generally, we look at a snapshot of inventory position of around 50% of sold to unsold homes in total inventory that will vary higher and lower at different points in the year. But -- and that\u2019s sort of a result of every one of our operating divisions evaluating their communities one by one, looking at a trailing sales pace along with an expected forward sales pace based upon where they are in the year and what they are seeing in those sub-markets. And then they are adjusting their spec inventory kind of relative to the construction cycle of that community and managing it week-to-week-to-week based on sales, closing and production completions. And there are varying starts on that basis, so the sum result of it comes up to about a 50% ratio plus or minus throughout the year. Ken Zener : Thank you. Mike Murray : Thank you. So 2 :1 is a good ratio. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matthew Bouley : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the closing guidance. I think 3% to 6% in the third quarter and it seems that the full year guide suggests some acceleration of that growth in the fourth quarter. So, I mean, is that third quarter guide, I guess, the 3% to 6%, is that a fair reflection for how you are seeing, I guess, the sales environment today, obviously, as you just mentioned, 40% orders and closings in the same quarter. And then, what kind of gives you confidence in that acceleration in the fourth quarter, is it really just the timing of your spec completions or I guess what else can you say there? Thank you. Bill Wheat : I think, yes, we touched on for spec completions, as well as a bit of an elongated demand cycle this spring is what got displaced from the market in the fall. Still the same people that want to live in a home from the fall. Still want to live in a home. They still have a housing need, and we are positioned to supply that need this summer. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on the purchase accounting. Can you \u00fb do you have the numbers for what that was in the second quarter and then how that will trend into the third and fourth quarters? Jessica Hansen : Sure. So, Matthew, we saw actually 20 basis points of impact in our March quarter. Honestly, probably a little bit lighter than we would have expected. We did \u00fb not that we like to talk about weather, but some of our acquisitions are in markets that do experience a little bit more extreme weather than a lot of the markets we already operated in. So a little bit of that purchase accounting impact has been delayed really until this quarter, Q3 and into Q4. So wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that 20 basis points of impact in March ticks up in June. Matthew Bouley : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nishu Sood from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Nishu Sood : Thank you. Just wanted to ask about the DHI Communities, appreciate the incremental details on that. Now that part of your business seems to be maturing, just wondering if you could give us some kind of broad brush strokes on how you expect that to grow, how big a part of the business it can become, what regions of the country you might ultimately expect it to be and then whether it would kind of stick to the garden style apartments or whether it might broaden in terms of product lines. Just wanted to kind of get whatever longer-term visions you can provide right now? David Auld : We are, I think, very happy with the progress to-date, building out a team, identifying sites. The whole key for us is sustainable and scalable. So it\u2019s going to play very closely in with our homebuilding operations. The sites that we are building on right now are pieces of property that were a part of our larger communities where we are building houses. It seems very synergistic to what we are trying to accomplish. It allows us to reach affordability of buyers or not buyers, but homeowners, future homeowners, it gives them -- we start a relationship with them, so we are very excited about it. I think right now, we have four projects under construction. Two pretty much completed and were in lease-up and a pipeline of deals across the country of more than 20. So, over time, it\u2019s going to be a pretty significant business for us. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks. Mike Murray : And from some very early-stage projects to more robust further down the line. We still expect the next couple of years, we are not going to see a sale of recorder, but there will be occasional sales as we deliver the first set of projects that have been in the pipeline the last couple of years, but then over the longer term certainly expect some growth there. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks. So coming back to the annual guidance, I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions about it and it\u2019s been a very difficult environment over the past six months to nine months to even think about what \u201819 might have looked like. Investors generally looking at the market, rates have fallen, the outlook for the year, obviously, from what builders have been saying has improved. And so just wanted to dig into how are you reflecting that in your guidance that you have given? I mean, if you look at the volume guidance, for example, acquisitions are a big part of it and gross margins you are expecting some modest improvement. So -- and of course we appreciate your more kind of level approach to giving guidance through these periods of volatility, but how should we think about how your guidance is reflecting improvement in demand that the market has seen in recent months, should we think about their potentially being more upside against your guidance or it\u2019s a de-risk to guidance or how should we think about that? Jessica Hansen : I would tell you the first thing I would take away is we feel good enough to give guidance again. So that to me is the biggest takeaway is that the spring has been good enough. We felt comfortable to sit here today and provide that level of guidance. We will continue to update quarterly as we can, but with six months left in the year, the houses we have under construction, the spring sales we have seen to-date. As -- we don\u2019t want to put guidance out there, we don\u2019t feel comfortable that we can hit, but I\u2019d tell you that we think the 55,000 to 56,000 annual homes is a very realistic range at what we would expect to deliver for this year. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to follow-up on Nishu\u2019s comment or his question about the DHI Communities, just wondering, I guess, are you considering a build to hold strategy or are these all going to be built for sale at some point and also would you consider JV partners or some other capital structure to scale that up more quickly? Mike Murray : Currently, we are in a kind of a build-for-sale operation. We would evaluate alternative capital structures. David mentioned before, we are looking for something that\u2019s scalable and sustainable and that would certainly be more accretive to returns in that business. First thing for us was simplistically wanting to figure out and kind of understand the business and looking at how we can build that business as sort of a combination with our homebuilding platform across the country. So a lot of the initial pipeline that we have been working within current projects have largely been on land parcels that are part of larger master plans we have been developing and building homes in and rather than in the past typically selling off those corners of land to other developers, look to develop the capabilities to monetize that land and add that value ourselves. So as we look to roll it out forward and accelerate it, we would certainly be looking at the capitalization of that business with a lot of options open in front of us. Buck Horne : Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And on the debt that you have coming due in the next 12 months, I think, you mentioned another $500 million. Is there a plan to possibly pay that off sooner or would you wait until the maturity on that? And also just related to Forestar\u2019s Capital Plans, how are you thinking about the market timing for their debt or equity? Mike Murray : In terms of the Horton Capital Plan, no plans to pay off the next maturity early, we will be then evaluating our cash flow, our investment plans for fiscal 2020 and as we put those plans together, we will determine whether we simply pay that debt off or whether we refinance all or a portion of that. In terms of Forestar Capital, very pleased with the progress that has been made with respect to building the capital stack at Forestar. Them issuing their first issuance of senior notes here in April was an important step to getting the capital to start making investments for fiscal \u201821 revenues for Forestar. Certainly equity is in the plans as well, and we want to be prepared and in position for Forestar to issue equity when the opportunity presents itself. I have been very pleased that Forestar now has three equity analysts covering them, and the management team at Forestar really alongside the Horton team here as well is starting to hold more meetings with investors. We will begin attending some investor conferences and basically getting the story out there. I would encourage investors to look at the Investor deck that\u2019s on the Forestar website. It\u2019s very helpful in describing the lot manufacturing business model at Forestar and certainly look forward to them being able to expand their float in the future. Jessica Hansen : And Forestar will start having a stand-alone conference call beginning in the June quarter. Buck Horne : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live. Soham Bhonsle : Hey. Good morning, guys. This is actually Soham Bhonsle on for Jack this morning, just on your gross margin guide for third quarter, I know you guys are on the lower end of 19.3, which is flat. But how do we sort of get to the higher end of 19.8? Can you just maybe talk through some of the moving parts of how we could get there? Bill Wheat : Sure. We do have some cost tailwinds that we do expect to start coming through our closing in Q3, primarily from lumber pricings having dropped in the latter part of \u201818 and as we have talked about a bit as we have been able to pull back our incentives gradually through the spring, that should result in some improved margins versus the closing we have seen in Q2, say, those are our primary factors that we would expect to see some sequential or potential for margin improvement. Soham Bhonsle : Okay. Great. And then, on sales pace, it looks like core sales pace was ex the acquisitions, was up 1% but down 2% if you were to include the acquisitions, can you just confirm that? And then, in going forward should we expect order increases to be more a function of pace improvement at this point or more of community count year-over-year? Jessica Hansen : So on your first question, our absorption kind of on the same-store basis is up 1% year-over-year and it was up 49% sequentially. So that\u2019s kind of right in line with traditional seasonality and even ex-acquisitions and then the second question? Soham Bhonsle : Just in terms of how should we think about order improvement year-over-year, is it pace-driven or community count? Jessica Hansen : Oh! Well, our community count did tick-up organically this quarter and then even further because of the acquisitions, so I\u2019d anticipate the community count remaining up through the remainder of the year. We will see what comes from absorption versus communities, but we haven\u2019t given a specific guide to sales. Soham Bhonsle : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. David Auld : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is just can you talk a little bit to what you have seen across your various brands? You have got such a range in there with Freedom, Express, Emerald. Can you just talk to maybe some of the differences that you have seen and especially maybe as things have improved as we have moved through the quarter? David Auld : We are very happy with the performance of all the brands. I mean, we are growing Freedom. I think that\u2019s going to be a very important part of our future offerings. Emerald has stayed fairly steady at about 3% of our deliveries. The Horton brand maintains dominance and Express, it\u2019s pretty much fully rolled out, so I think that 30, 35 may go up a little bit, percent of deliveries will remain constant. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then can you just talk to any updated expectations as it relates to input cost. You have talked in the past about lumber coming off and how that could provide some offset within the gross margins to some of the pressures that are there. Has anything changed in there or anything that we should sort of be thinking about in the back half? Jessica Hansen : No. Su, I mean, we do expect that cost moderation to primarily come from lumber as it pertains to other material inputs. We have always got some costs that are rising, but we generally find ways to offset those so we would expect lumber to be a tailwind to gross margin in the back half of the year. Labor costs haven\u2019t come down, even with some of the softness. But in terms of trade availability, that\u2019s helped a little bit as some builders have slowed their starts this spring as compared to maybe what was anticipated. I don\u2019t think we have given our revenue and stick-and-brick per square foot yet that we typically provide on the call, so on a year-over-year basis our revenues per square foot were up about 2% versus our stick-and-brick costs which were up 4%, so that goes right in line with the year-over-year decline in gross margin we saw. Sequentially that was a much tighter range. Our revenue per square foot was essentially flat and our stick-and-brick cost per square foot was just very, very slightly up. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Your line is now live. Alex Barron : Thanks. I wanted to ask along the lines of the multi-family rental business, whether you guys have given any thought or have started any plans to build out single-family rental communities for sale. David Auld : Something we are always looking at opportunities, Alex, and as we get further into that, if we get further into that, we will certainly let you know. Alex Barron : Okay. [Inaudible] Mike Murray : If the question is have we given it any thought, absolutely, w watch everything going on in the industry. Alex Barron : One last one if I can ask on the other one, the multi-family, I don\u2019t know if you guys if I missed it or did you guys give any specific guidance. Can we expect another of those communities to be sort of report another gain next quarter or not necessarily? David Auld : We have not given specific guidance, Alex. We are still in the early stage. This was the first project sale in the multi-family division. We do have four projects under construction and two projects that are substantially completed in the lease-up phase. So we sort of would expect we would have two projects in the coming quarters. But we don\u2019t expect to see a sale every quarter. So we are not in a position yet to provide more specific guidance than that. Alex Barron : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Take care. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in July to share the third quarter results and to the D.R. Horton team, incredibly proud of what you guys have accomplished out there over the last six months. I just want to thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Please go ahead. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q this week. After this call, we will post an investor presentation and supplementary data to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. The supplementary data relates to our homebuilding return on inventory, home sales gross margin, changes in active selling communities, our product mix and mortgage operations. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid third quarter of 2019. Our consolidated revenues increased 11% to $4.9 billion. Pre-tax income was $627 million, and our pre-tax profit margin was 12.8%. The spring selling season was solid and our homebuilding gross margin improved sequentially. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer affordable homes across multiple brands. As we\u2019ve discussed on our last few calls, affordability concerns caused some moderation in demand for homes in late fiscal 2018 and early fiscal 2019. And in response, we increased sales incentives to improve our sales pace. Interest rates on mortgage loans have since decreased and we reduced the level of incentives offered as the spring progressed. We continue to see good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets. At the same time, economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid. We are pleased with our product positioning and our sales volumes of the June quarter and in July, which were in line with our expectations and normal seasonality. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns and maintaining a flexible financial position. With the conservative balance sheet that includes ample supply of homes, lots and land to support growth, we are well-positioned for the remainder of 2019 and future years. Mike? Mike Murray : Net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 5% to $475 million compared to $454 million in the prior year quarter. And net income per diluted share increased 7% to $1.26. Our consolidated pre-tax income for the quarter increased to $627 million, and our homebuilding pre-tax income was $562 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 11% to $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed, up from $4.3 billion on 14,114 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was down 2% from last year to $296,400, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 6% to 15,588 homes, and the value of those orders was $4.7 billion, up 8% from $4.4 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 9% from the prior year and 1% sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired earlier this year, both our third quarter net sales orders and our average number of active selling communities increased 3% year-over-year. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $302,000, up 1% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 20% compared to 21% in the same quarter last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 20.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from the March to June quarter exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to lower incentives and lumber costs. Based on today's market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to increase sequentially from the third quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix as well as the relative impact of warrantee, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.1%, flat with the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A expense was 8.8% of revenues compared to 8.7% last year. We remain focused on managing our SG&A efficiently while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports opportunities to increase our market share over the long term. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the quarter with 29,200 homes in inventory, 14,800 of our homes were unsold, with 9,200 in various stages of construction, and 5,600 completed. Our current inventory of homes puts us in a great position to finish the year strong. Our homebuilding investments in lots, land and development during the third quarter totaled $875 million of which $470 million was for land and finished lots, and $405 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre-tax return on inventory and a return of our initial cash investment within 24 months. David? David Auld : At June 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of 300,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 55% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the expansion of Forestar's national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter increased to $48.1 million from $30.3 million in the prior year quarter. Financial services pre-tax profit margin for the quarter was 40.2%, up from 31.2% in the prior year, due to improved loan sale execution. 98% of our mortgage company's loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 58% of D.R. Horton homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 51% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 48% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering affordable homes for entry-level buyers. Mike? Mike Murray : Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, now operating in 50 markets across 20 states. At June 30th, Forestar owned and controlled approximately 37,400 lots of which 24,100 are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer. During the 9 months into June 30th, Forestar delivered 2,224 lots and is on track to deliver 4,000 lots in fiscal 2019, generating $320 million to $350 million of revenue and deliver approximately 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020, generating $700 million to $800 million of revenue. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results. Forestar's making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar issued $350 million of senior notes. Forestar's liquidity, capital base and lot position at June 30th are sufficient to support their planned delivery through fiscal 2021. Subject to market conditions, Forestar expects to opportunistically access the equity and debt capital markets to provide additional long-term growth capital, while managing to a net leverage ratio of 40% or less. Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and has an updated presentation on their Investors site at investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar's unique lot manufacturing model, and its significant growth and value creation opportunity. David? David Auld : DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company, focused on suburban garden-style apartments with current operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its second apartment project located in Houston for $60 million and recognized a gain on sale of 22,600,000. DHI Communities has five projects under active construction, one project that was substantially completed at the end of the quarter, which we currently expect to be sold in early fiscal 2020. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $167 million at June 30th. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and multi-year earnings and cash flow generation have increased our flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During the first nine months of fiscal 2019 our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $605.7 million. At June 30th, we had $1.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, including $578 million of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage ratio improved 370 basis points from a year ago to 18.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion, and we have $500 million of senior note maturities due in the next 12 months. At June 30th, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $9.6 billion, and book value per share was $26.08, up 14% from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $56 million. We also repurchased 3.7 million shares of common stock for $159.3 million, utilizing the remainder of our outstanding authorization. Our stock repurchases for the first nine months of the year totaled 9.8 million shares for $375.5 million, resulting in a 2% decline in our outstanding share count at the end of the quarter compared to a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board issued a new authorization to repurchase up to $1 billion of our common stock with no expiration date. Our top priorities for cash flow utilization remain to consolidate market share by investing in our homebuilding business and strategic acquisitions, reduce homebuilding leverage, and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.9 billion and to close approximately 15,700 to 16,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 20.4% to 20.7% and homebuilding SG&A in the fourth quarter to be approximately 8.1% to 8.3% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter in the range of 31% to 34%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5%. For the full fiscal year 2019, we still expect to generate cash flow from homebuilding operations of least $1 billion and we expect our outstanding share count to be down approximately 2% at the end of the year, compared to the end of fiscal 2018. Based on today's market conditions, our expected growth for fiscal 2020 is currently in the mid to high-single-digit percentage range for both consolidated revenues and homes closed. We expect to get further fiscal 2020 guidance on our November earnings call. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our long-tenured, well-established operating platform across the country. We're striving to be the leading builder in each of our markets, and to expand our industry-leading market share. We have been the largest builder by volume in the United States for 17 consecutive years. According to Builder Magazine's recent Local Leaders issue, in 2018, we were the number one builder in all of the top five U.S. housing markets. And D.R. Horton was a top 5 builder in 31 of the top 50 housing markets. We are focused on consolidating market share, while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns, while maintaining a flexible financial position. We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balancing, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offerings across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced team across the country. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus on hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live. Carl Reichardt : Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk a little bit, just first of all, on the South Central and the Southwest regions where orders were off a little bit. Can you just talk, maybe Mike or David, about community count versus absorption rates there? I think Southwest is short communities now and the plan is to kind of -- to re-grow those reasons? Mike Murray : Yes. What we're seeing in the Southwest is that we are short communities relative to where we were. And frankly, that's a function of our success we've had in those markets. We've sold communities at faster paces than anticipated, and the replacement communities are not yet on line. And we will be looking to replace those communities replace those flags. South Central, frankly, is going up against a very tough sales comp. Last year, I think, they work over 20% in this quarter. And while their community count\u2019s going to be about flat, absorptions did not grow as much. But we're frankly pretty satisfied with the absorptions we have there this year, based on what we saw in the late fall and early winter, and then, seeing the margin expansion that we've been able to achieve with a little stronger selling season. Jessica Hansen : And the specifics will be in our supplemental presentation available with our call, Carl. But just for reference, our Southwest active selling communities were down 13% year-over-year, right in line with the sales orders, so, very strong absorption still out of that market. Carl Reichardt : And then, just as a follow-up, we've talked a lot about local market share and the advantages that can bring. And we've seen some peers of yours move to lower price points, and they're delivering on a greater order growth than you but at margins that are well below. Can you talk a little bit about as to whoever meets the road here in what has been a softish market? Can you talk about how you've been leveraging market share to protect those margins, grow those margins and keep your absorptions reasonably strong? Thanks, guys. David Auld : We've been in this affordability push for the last five years. We have incredibly well positioned communities, very deep and lot supply. And it's not something that is going to continue to outgrow the overall percentage of what we grow. It has driven growth for the last three or four years. It's fully rolled out. And from a competitive standpoint, yes, there are people pushing down in price, they're having give away more margin than we are, because they're not as well positioned or as deeply positioned as we are. So, we feel very good about what we've done, where we've done, and feel very good about the pace and margin balance that we're now executing, so. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, David. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is on the $1 billion share repurchase authorization. That seems like a little bit of a pivot for you guys, and we think it's pretty positive. But, maybe you could just give us a little help on what drove the decision? And then, in terms of expected cadence of repos, would you expect to be kind of consistent buyers each quarter, more opportunistically, how should we think about that? Bill Wheat : Yes. Thanks, John. This is Bill. This is the next step for us. We've begun being a more consistent repurchaser of our shares over the last couple of years. And generally, the pace of our repurchases have been increasing over the quarters, with opportunistic fluctuations when we see a pullback in the stock. But, we're repurchasing shares out of our cash flow. And as our cash flow is increased, we've increased our repurchases. So, we see this authorization is kind of the next step in that process. We do expect to continue to be a consistent repurchaser, but we will see some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, depending on obviously the opportunities.  The authorization has no expiration date. So, it doesn't necessarily imply a specific cadence or specific time frame, they would all be spent. But if you like, that was the appropriate amount to authorize, to put out in front of us and signal to the market that we're going to continue to be a consistent repurchaser. John Lovallo : Yes. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then, in terms of July kind of being in line with normal seasonality, and then that coupled with the 2020 outlook that you guys put out there, it seems like the market is doing reasonably well here. I mean, one of the pushbacks that we get from some folks is that lower interest rates kind of resulted in some pull forward orders over the past couple of quarters. That doesn't seem to be the case. But, I just wanted to get your view on that. David Auld : That's not my belief. I can tell you. I think that there is tremendous opportunities, tremendous demand in the affordable market, households, the employment, jobs being created. And there's just a limited amount of supply even today. So, I think, the demand is there, if you can position and drive a price that they can buy. John Lovallo : Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thanks. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job with the margin improvement. I think, we were actually surprised that you were able to drive that level of improvement. And at the same time, it looks like you had a lot of success selling specs in the quarter. I think, this is the first time in quite a while where your homes and inventory is actually down slightly year-over-year. So, just curious if you could talk a little bit about -- did you see -- was that a concerted effort to drive that spec count lower during the quarter or was that just a function of where the demand was? And I guess, more broadly, with your inventory position down slightly, is that by design, or are there some headwinds that might be slowing the construction cycle, labor, or weather, et cetera? Just talk through all that, would be great. Thank you. Mike Murray : Sure. Thank you, Alan. This is Mike. What I would touch on is that seasonally, we would expect to see our homes inventory build in the earlier quarters and then start to kind of run down as we satisfy some of that spring selling demand. I think, this quarter, we had 38% of the homes we closed this quarter were sold in the quarter as well. And so, a lot of that reflected with the enhanced margins, our reduced incentives and seeing a buyer return to the market and a little bit of tailwind on some material costs, most notably lumber. We have inventory position where we like it right now, coming to our fourth quarter. We have more inventory right now than we had this time last year. And we expect to be well-positioned at September 30th to start fiscal \u201820, as well. We're not seeing any real times [ph]. I mean, we're continuing to do what we do. Alan Ratner : Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just on the pricing environment, you mentioned pulling back on incentives. Can you talk a little bit about the percentage of communities where you raise net prices, either through lower incentives, or for outright based price increases? I think, your order price actually ticked higher year-over-year, which was first time in quite a while, but I know there's a lot of mix involved there. So, are you seeing pricing power? What percentage of your communities or which markets are you seeing it in, and to what magnitude? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Generally, most of the improvement in our gross margin was driven purely by lower incentives, and not from pricing power. I would say today versus at any point, really, last year in fiscal 2018, we still have less processing power today than we did a year ago. But the pullback in rights has helped. So, it's a little bit better sequentially in that regard. But, the main drivers to our gross margin in Q3 and also what we're expecting, in terms of improvement in Q4, is more from the pullback on incentives. And that continues roll back and then it is pure pricing power. Alan Ratner : Do you have those numbers handy, Jessica, just percentage of ASP that are incentives today versus a year ago, quarter ago you kind of see? Jessica Hansen : So, we don't typically quantify incentives, because to us, whether it's price or if it's something flowing through cost of sales, it all falls out in the margin. So, to us, margin is a best grade and we don't typically try to quantify incentives that way. Operator : Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live. Eric Bosshard : To follow up just to make sure we understand the path forward with incentives and pricing, talk about your comfort of what you're doing in both those areas. Now, if the progress that you saw in this quarter is the new normal, or if you feel like there's further opportunity in the area of incentives and price? Mike Murray : I think, Eric, it\u2019s something we continually measure and manage community-by-community. And our operators in the field are making those pricing decisions to meet the market that they see in front of them. So, I would expect that we would, as Jessica mentioned, in the gross margin guidance, continue to see a little bit improved margin into our fourth quarter. Based on the selling environment we're in today and the strength of the buyer that\u2019s coming to our doors, we feel really good about that. I think, we're going to see some further expansion in margin and as well as maintaining the pace that we're at. Eric Bosshard : And then, secondly, the guidance looks like now your full-year deliveries will be at the high end of the range you established earlier. What's different within that? Is that a better market or better market share? How would you sort of segment between those two factors that are contributing to you getting to the high end of the range? Mike Murray : I think, it's just a better visibility. As we've gotten through the spring way and we've been able to see our pace continue at a solid base, we have a greater confidence level in our ability to sell and sell through the homes that we have and deliver on during this fiscal year. Just the sequential improvement visibility, I think was the primary factor. It's a very solid market as evidenced by our ability to pull back incentives throughout the quarter. And I think we're still seeing a very solid market out here as we go into our Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Truman Patterson : Good morning, everybody. First, I wanted to look at your option lot count. As a percent of total lots, it ticked down a little bit sequentially. I figured, you guys would have continued increasing this, given Forestar, et cetera. Could you guys just discuss a little bit about what drove this in a lean environment in general, are you seeing the availability of option land or developers improving? Mike Murray : In terms of the change in the option percentage, Truman, I think, that number is very dynamic. It moves, every time we sign a contract or take down lots or cancel a contract. And so, there's a lot of volatility in that. Directionally, the general trend we've had over the past few quarters and past few years, frankly, as we've been working on this has been to push it higher. And we're continuing to work at that. We\u2019re working with developers, both Forestar and other third-party developers constantly, looking for ways to expand that controlled lot position and partner with them to deliver communities and lots to us. Availability, it's still a tough job to find the right land and to get it entitled in today's market, and bring it into production. It is something our team across the country works very hard at every day. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, you guys gave us a little bit on 2020 guidance, I believe mid to high-single-digit revenue growth. Could you just maybe break that out how you're thinking about market conditions? And with that, your all's community count growth possibly versus absorption improvement? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Truman. That's our preliminary fiscal 2020 guidance. So, today, it's only July, we're going to stick with just consolidated revenue growth in homes closed in the mid to high-single-digits percentage range. And we'll give further breakdown and color in November when we completed our fiscal year end. Mike Murray : Obviously, the only perspective we can give on that is based on today's market conditions. So, that's assuming that conditions remain relatively consistent with today. Truman Patterson : Directionally, would you assume that your core community count continues to grow? Jessica Hansen : We've never given specific guidance on community count, and we're just going to stick with what we currently expect for fiscal \u201820. And we may have a little bit of nonspecific guidance, but color on community count in November, but today, that's what we feel comfortable with our preliminary guidance. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. Nice quarter. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the results. The first question I had was on sales pace, and I guess a little bit of a pace versus price question, but, more focused around sales pace. You\u2019ve had some competitors that have sales pace up anywhere from mid-single-digits to healthy, very healthy double-digit rates. You guys are a little bit more plus or minus flattish this year. But in contrast, you've had strong double-digit sales pace growth for the prior three, four years. So, my question is, are you just at a point and the mark, your own shift towards first time, which kind of led the industry, kind of in a more of a steady state, and it's kind of taking the market as it is? Because it seems like, most of the builders talk about this improved strength or improving strength at entry level that's driving that higher sales pace, whereas you might already have been there and benefited. I'm trying to just reconcile that because obviously also, it seems like you're a little bit more comfortable today, not necessarily adhering at any price, adhering to the double-digit top-line growth and focusing a little bit more on a balanced approach. So, just trying to get a sense of -- long-winded question, I apologize, but that more flattish sales pace, kind of how that reconciles with some of the other builders we're seeing, and versus your own positioning over the last few years. Mike Murray : Michael, thank you very much. This is Mike. I think, the way to start with the answer to the question is, we've tried to move to the entry level to the affordable product positioning that\u2019s expressed five years ago. And we had been out rolling that out and seeing very good absorption in demand for that product very well received over the past five years. And we did fuel a lot of years of double-digit top-line growth in units. We, as David mentioned on the call, secured a lot of very good long land positions and opportunities in that. And we are now -- we're at a place in our rollout that is fairly mature, we're getting good absorptions for immunity. And from a balanced perspective, we're looking at the pace and price and focusing on what's driving the best returns for our inventory investments. And that's what we're seeing today is that we've got a pace that we're very, very satisfied with in our communities looking at each one of them individually, and then looking to see what can we do to adjust incentives, adjust product offerings, to enhance margins, that then increases overall return in those communities as we're working through. So by and large, we have done the rollout to the entry level. And now, we're looking to kind of, if you would, turn the sales on the business plan a little bit to maximize the returns we're getting out of those communities, and continuing to look for new communities to replace those. So others -- we've been saying for a long time, as we've opened up communities, we see great demand, and we were not able to satisfy all that demand. So, some others have come in and are helping to meet a bit of that demand. But we still feel really good about our positioning and the performance we're getting out of this. Michael Rehaut : I guess, secondly, on the lot positioning. I noticed that the option lot percentage ticked down a point sequentially in the third quarter after, again, several years of very impressive growth and gains in that number. How should we think about the optional lot percentage course over the next couple of years? Obviously, the low-60s kind of exceeded your goal or hit your goal faster than expected. Should we kind of expect this type of range to be more of the new normal, or is there kind of another leg up in the option lot percentage over the next of couple years? Mike Murray : I think, you asked the question the right way in the term of years to look at this. It is a fairly volatile measurement and we have been very fortunate the past several quarters, it has been nothing but increased. But, it will bounce a little bit from time-to-time. But directionally, over the next few years, we would still expect that controlled lot position to climb above its current level. I would say that there's going to be a rapid accelerated leg with that or anything we can point to as a catalyst to take it immediately up 3% to 5%, 7%, 10%. But continually, as we're continuing to adjust our business to focus on returns, we're looking to continue to control more land and partner with more third parties in delivering lots to the builder. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask back on the inventory side, just looking at the finished versus under constructions back. It looked like the finished spec was a little higher as a mix than it typically is. Can you just elaborate a little on why that is? Obviously, you gave us that near-term margin guide, but just kind of any implications around margins or incentives from where that finished spec position is? Thank you. Mike Murray : We certainly are in strong position to sell and to deliver on what our guidance is for Q4 fiscal \u201819, and fiscal \u201820, and the finished spec position gives us an ability to sell and close homes in the same quarter. So, we're pleased with that positioning, but really no, really implications on our margin guide. We expect our margin to still tick up into Q4 and feel good about our positioning in the market to continue to maintain margins at that level. Jessica Hansen : We have a very strong focus on completed an unsold specs over a period of time. And that number for homes greater than six months that have been completed and unsold, have stayed in a really tight 400 to 600 homes range, which on our overall base of inventory of on those 30,000 homes is very manageable. And as Bill said, we feel like we\u2019re in a very strong position for Q4. Matthew Bouley : Okay, perfect. And then, just secondly, back on the closings guide, 7% to 9% in the fourth quarter, but, just looking at the backlog units. And as we just talked about that inventory units are down year-over-year so, clearly the backlog conversion is stepping up nicely. So, is it really just what you're seeing in the sales environment in July, is labor perhaps loosening? Just what are you guys seeing that's allowing for that type of improvement in backlog conversion? Thank you. Mike Murray : I think, one of the things to discuss on is that we have a fair bit of completed homes both unsold as well as sold that will be delivered in the fourth quarter. In the aggregate, our homes and inventory are up year-over-year. They're down sequentially, which is seasonally, what we would expect in our business plan. So, we have the homes out there, we're going to close in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. So, if we could just do a little math here. Basically, you were running a lot more pre-built homes in 1Q, so you closed higher percent in 3Q as how I look at here your 38% number that you disclosed for intra quarter orders closing. What I'm interested in is your closing for 4Q at the low end, 15,700 up to 16,000, that's interesting and that you have a -- that's a pretty high percent of your under construction, which is how you do everything. Can you explain why that low end of guidance, which is 54% of units and that construction will be up from 49% last year. I know you have specs pre-built homes, which is normal and you had a last year. So, are you getting higher conversion cycles or what is it? Jessica Hansen : Well, to be specific about the completed specs that we've referenced a couple of times, we have 6,000 -- actually 5,600 completed specs at the end of this year. Last year, we only had about 3,600. So, we are in a very strong position to deliver on that guidance. And right behind those completed specs, we also have homes that are close to completion that we can also sell and close in the same quarter. Ken Zener : Now, using that same logic where you guys -- well, you guys referred to seasonal order pace, so kind of your pace sequentially. And in prior years, you'd given guidance where your implication was because of the entry level or other type of products, you saw greater absorption. Is there -- so my question to you is, I mean, is there any reason, as you gave guidance for FY20 that you'd see anything other than normal seasonality? Jessica Hansen : Not that we see today. I mean, we don't have a crystal ball to what the spring selling season looks like. But, where we sit today, we anticipate normal seasonality. Ken Zener : And then, last question. Could you, given the mix in the third quarter of 38%, I think there's normally 35% inter quarter closings. What was the spread, would you say, between those pre-built homes being ordered and closed versus your backlog? Jessica Hansen : The stuff we sell and close in the same quarter is almost 100% homes that were already started going into the quarter. Ken Zener : And the margin differential between those and backlog? Jessica Hansen : We generally just look at our spec margin versus our build job margin. And generally, our specs run at slightly lower gross margin than our build jobs. But, they turn faster. So, from a return perspective, they're always accretive. Mike Murray : And then, roughly 80% of the homes closed are specs. So really, our overall margin really does reflect larger spec margin. David Auld : I would say that the houses we sold and closed in the quarter, we probably achieved a better margin on those than we would have, if we would have sold them in the first quarter or the second quarter. Mike Murray : Right. Yes, it is interesting dynamic. David Auld : I think, that is part of the margin lift we saw and expected. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is now live. Jack Micenko : I wanted to sort of back up on incentives a little bit. I think, it's been pretty well telegraphed in the market that a large competitor\u2019s been using incentives to meet a volume goal. And I think some other market peers and you also sort of called it, the margin beat this quarter. Is it -- I guess, I'm curious, is it the market and some of those pressures getting better? And David, earlier you talked about positioning of your assets, certainly market segmentation and entry level. Your margin improvement, is it -- how much of it is those three items? Is that the market just getting better or is it\u2026 David Auld : I would say the affordability we gained, affordability in the quarter because interest rates dropped, lumber prices reduced a little bit, which both those things helped I think margin. But, I can tell you, we get up every day thinking about positioning and how we're trying to put the right house, right lot, right community and then have it priced to turn. And so, -- and I know, it\u2019s psychoish to say this, but we really don't look at the other builders much. So, we're just trying to get better in our community presentations, our community offerings and stay competitive every day. So, I would say, it's more Horton than the market, but I'm probably a slightly biased. Jack Micenko : Okay. And then, on the apartment business, I know it started out, it's been kind of a smaller initiative, but I think you\u2019ve built so far a lot of these near master plans as we already doing. Is that mandate or the strategy changed? I mean, are you still merchant build? Do we see a pivot to some homes and release cash flow? Obviously, there is a couple -- the public's is feeling the same thing. And then, just a reminder on project level financing, is that all on Horton\u2019s balance sheet, are you partnering, how do we think about that a year from now? David Auld : I'd say, when we started this, we thought it was going to work hand in hand with our home building operations. Where we started it was in communities where we had apartment zoned land, we owned that typically we would have sold and felt like we could drive higher value for our shareholders by building it out and selling it. Our long-term strategy is to sustain and then scale that program. And whether we buy -- whether we hold them, sell them is going to depend on market and cap rates and pipeline, fields we got coming. Right now, as we're learning the business, we're selling. And they actually -- even Bill Wheat was a little skeptical going into it, but they're driving pretty good returns. And as we look at our pipeline of stuff that's under construction right now, it looks like a business that's going to be able to -- we're going to be able to scale. Jessica Hansen : Jack, in terms of financing, it's all on our balance sheet today, but we are assessing what that looks like in the future. And we'd expect to utilize some level of third-party capital at some point. David Auld : And ultimately, it comes back to people. And I can tell you, what our community guys have done in a establishing platform, and getting the right people in the right slots has been very impressive. So, we like what we see so far. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : I wanted to talk a little bit about your 2020 guide. In particular, this year, you decided not to include a margin guide in 2020, and just wanted to get into that a little bit. Obviously, there's a lot we can't know about what the next year is going to bring in terms of the economy and demand, from rates. But, there are two things, two factors that I think we can maybe think about, qualitatively. One is the margin on specs, and the second is the lumber benefit, which is you're seeing near-term. On the specs, David, I believe you mentioned that you thought that margins on specs are usually a little lower than the built to order, but not right now, and in part because of the drop in rates, I mean actually, so folks wanted to close quickly and lock in those rates. That benefit to your margin on your specs relative to BTO, I would assume shouldn't -- we shouldn't assume that's going to continue unless rates drop further, which is not something that I would assume you would bake into your outlook. And then, secondly, in some of the lumber benefit, I'm thinking -- we don't know how much that was. I'd be curious if you could give it to us. But, I assume that benefit shouldn't be assumed to continue in 2020 either. So, these are two things that may be in the margin next year. Are there material offset to these things that you could point to that might give us some hope that margins could grow next year? Jessica Hansen : As we've kind of outlined, we get preliminary guidance with what we feel comfortable with today that we can commit to for fiscal 2020. And it's all subject to today's market conditions. We're going to focus as we always have on maximizing returns. And gross margin is going to be a product of both the overall market and what it takes from a price and pace perspective community-by-community to maximize returns. And so, we're not going to try in July to give any sort of gross margin color for fiscal \u201820, other than continuing to make sure, we're balancing pace and price to maximize returns. David Auld : I may have misspoke. But just to clarify what I thought I said. The houses we sold and closed in Q3 were at a higher margin than if we would have sold and closed the houses that we sold and closed in Q1 -- specs. Because incentives have abated, and we are seeing less of a need to incentivize a finished house to get it under contract and close. Jessica Hansen : But, what I said earlier about spec margins generally being lower than build job margins is still true. That was true this quarter and that would be in any base case scenario we have. Stephen Kim : And I guess, could you give some color with respect to the lumber benefit? You didn't really talk specifically about that. Could you just dimensionalize that for us in some manner? Mike Murray : We probably would quantify that as about in our sequential margin improvement. Probably about 20 to 30 bps of tailwind came from lower lumber costs in the homes we closed this quarter versus when we closed in the second quarter. Stephen Kim : And then the last one for me. I think, you mentioned somewhere along your remarks that the build -- the cycle time had not changed. So, your cycle time hasn't improved, and it hasn't deteriorated, I assume, is what that means. And then, therefore, I guess, I'm thinking into next year, or just as we go forward, if we're going to improve the returns without the margin, is it possible for you to do that effectively without increasing or shortening your build time on average? Mike Murray : We're not seeing our build times lengthen this year and they have not contracted as much as we would have liked. But, that does remain an area of focus to us is how do we be better stewards of the capital and turn that capital more efficiently, and getting build times to be as efficient as possible is certainly a huge part of that. And that's something we do get up every day and think about how to do that. I mean, David talked about, we try to enhance margin every day, we also try to enhance the build time. We talked about our cash flow cycles. That's a big part of our cash flow cycle. You're exactly right. That is an area we need to focus on. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Mike Dahl : My first question was still around kind of the pace versus margin or return discussion. And following up on, Jessica, what I think you just said and what Mike and David also touched on earlier. I know, it's not all one size fits all. But, at a high level, what I'm trying to figure out is, you go into the year with a, generally speaking, kind of a unit goal, you put inventory on the ground that positions you to meet that. And so, the question is, as you go through the year and demand kind of fluctuates? Is it the right way to think about what fits best from your results that the swing line is actually on gross margins versus upside or downside on units? Just because I think there's still a question of, whether there's some bigger picture strategic shift in the way you're thinking about volume versus margin or returns at this point, or if this is really just a function of market dynamics? David Auld : I talk about one of my divisions, margin is the great. If you do a great job of positioning the product for the price point and demand that exists, then you're going to run a very high margin, in excess of 20%. If you do a very poor job of positioning price point, product, then you're probably going to run a lower margin, because you're -- we are going hit a certain pace, we are going to maintain production in the community and then, adjust out that process. So, we do put a plan out there, we do have expectations. And when we get everything right, the margins run very, very high, when the markets working with us, the margins improve. So, we are going to run at a pace. Mike Dahl : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Mike Murray : Yes. In the short term, that margin grade is what the difference is between how well we do and how well we want to do. But in a little bit longer term, we can moderate, adjust the pace, based on market conditions, as we're seeing to maximize the return. And more broadly, as we've over the past 5 years, 10 years, coming out of the downturn, attained a lot of market share and scale, we've been able to then focus on how best to maximize the company's return on equity, and what are some of the levers we can pull there and consistently driving cash flow creating opportunities for us de-risk the balance sheet, invest in new opportunities for us to grow the business or to return more capital to shareholders, as we think it\u2019s the most creative way to drive value for our shareholders. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, my second question is just a follow-up to Steve's question around lumber. You quantified that as 20 to 30 points sequential benefit in 3Q. I was wondering what the sequential benefit is in your 4Q guide versus 3Q, specifically related to lumber? And then, can you give us at a higher level, your direct cost trends on -- I know your home size is shrinking, so maybe on a per square foot basis would be helpful. Mike Murray : I\u2019ll comment on Q4 first. So, it's a bit of a tailwind on lumber is a component of our guide of a sequential improvement of 10 to 40 basis points in gross margin in Q4. Don't have a specific component of that, because mix will impact that in actuality, but it is a component of our guide for sequential increase. Jessica Hansen : Yes. And outside of incentives and lumber, really our revenues per square foot and our cost per square foot were relatively flat sequentially, other than the two pieces that we called out which drove the improvement in gross margin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live. Ryan Tomasello : Good morning. This is Ryan on for Jade. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first, thinking bigger picture, do you think that the fundamental structure of the homebuilding industry is really too fragmented and therefore presents an opportunity for someone like D.R. Horton to consolidate over the intermediate term? David Auld : We've been consolidating. And I can tell you, our plan is to continue to consolidate. If you look at the industry when we went public, it was -- public builders were about 3% of the overall market. And every year, since then, the publics have gained more market share and we have gained more market share against the other publics. I for one don\u2019t see the change. Ryan Tomasello : And I guess, dovetailing off of that topic. Do you think that there are material scale economies that would further benefit the Company in the majority of your markets, or is that process somewhat over -- is that thought process somewhat overblown? Mike Murray : That's the big focus of ours. While we're certainly the largest volume builder in the country, we're not number one in every market. So, we're focused on what can we do in each market to aggregate market share and become the largest builder. We're top 5 in 31 of the top 50 markets. So, we see plenty of opportunity to still consolidate market-by-market and really that happens at community level every day. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is now live. Jay McCanless : The first question I had, could you talk about how orders trended on a monthly basis through the quarter? And then, if you could quantify what you see so far in July? Jessica Hansen : Jay, I think, we answered the call, David mentioned that we've seen in our June quarter and our July sales through -- we can't talk about today yet, but through most of the month, we've just seen normal seasonality and in line with our expectations. So putting this right where we want to be to deliver the fourth quarter we\u2019ve talked about. Jay McCanless : Okay. And then, I think you\u2019ve all commented on it a couple of times. But the expansion of the affordable product has basically been completed. I was wondering, if that applies to Freedom as well. And maybe what you're seeing from active adult demand, and also move up demand? Since most folks have been focused on affordable, would love to hear how some of these other sectors are performing? David Auld : The Freedom brand is still early in the rollout. We have gotten much better at positioning that product. But we're not anywhere near where we want to be, at this point. I will say that every community we\u2019ve rolled out seems to be a little better positioned, a little better reception from the customer. And it's a brand -- it\u2019s going to be a part of this company for a long time. And I think we'll at some point approach 10% plus of our deliveries. The luxury brand, again, we continue to get better at it, nowhere near where we want to be. It gives us areas to focus. Right now, the affordable product lines have driven returns and growth, and we pay our guys based upon returns and profits. So, their focus has been on delivering what the buyer wants. But, there will be a point in time where that will drive a better return than entry levels, at least it has been in past cycles. So, very happy with everything we're doing. We\u2019ve just got to get better. Operator : Our final question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Question, I think, you talked on the number of benefits you're getting. I was wondering, if you quantify or is it a little bit either on cost per square foot or otherwise, just how labor costs have been trending throughout the quarter? And also, what you're seeing in terms of land inflation that's out there? And my secondary question to that would just be, how you\u2019re pricing lots that are coming from Forestar, how do you negotiate those prices? Mike Murray : So, first of all, your question in terms of labor costs, we're not seeing a lot of other changes really in our steak and bread cost. So, labor costs right now quarter-on-quarter holding in flat, we're pleased with the relationships and the teams we have out there negotiating this. Land and development costs are always a challenge that we work back against, a lot of our deep positions and market scale of health with that, and we've now seen a lot of lot cost inflation coming through on this quarter\u2019s closings. So we're happy with the benefit that's produced. And then, the third part of the question, I think is Forestar\u2019s lot pricing. We look at for an opportunity that we bring to Forestar that we have tied up, we negotiate with Forestar and they have returned hurdles and metrics that they have to achieve. And our land teams what those are and they'll bring those projects to them and then negotiate take down structures and the pricing to achieve those return hurdles. And if it works for both parties, we go forward with the deal that Forestar does it. If it doesn't work, we can't find a way to make it work, then it's not a deal Forestar does. For an opportunity that Forestar sources, we have the opportunity to get up to have the lots tied up, but that's really, write a first offer or first refusal on those parcels. And, they have their return hurdles; they are out there competitively bidding it in the marketplace with other builders. And they'll work with us where it makes sense. And they'll work with other builders where it makes sense as well. So, they sell both to Horton and they sell to third-party builders as well. Buck Horne : One last one in there, just to switch gears to the mortgage market a little bit. There was some concern or some questions out of the industry with the FHFA discussing -- letting the path around DTI [ph] loans and debt to income ratios letting that have to fire in early 2021. And we\u2019re a long way up from there. But just wondering, if you could give us a feel or do you have any metrics around, how many of your buyers could be affected by a change in those underwriting framework, how many of your buyers have DTI ratios over 43% or anything around that could help? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Buck. I think you\u2019ve kind of hit the nail on the head with how we would start, which is 2021 is a long ways out. So, I think a lot can happen between then. And does it fully expire and go away or does some middle ground be reached between now and then, we'll see. It's a long ways out. In terms of our buyers and their debt to income for the buyers that are utilizing our mortgage company, on average for our entire mortgage company this quarter, the DTI percentage was about 42%. So, we do have a decent amount of our buyers that would be at that 43% or above. But, that doesn't mean just because it's the patch were to go away for conventional, there's not a product for them, they\u2019d still be eligible potentially for an FHA loan. And then, the first question we also always ask is do you have other sources of income that we can verify that we haven't yet, to go into that equation? So typically, any sort of change that gets implemented like that, is not 100% fallout. Our mortgage company just -- mortgage company does a phenomenal job of working with buyers in our pipeline to find them the different products. And if this patch were to expire, which I don't know that that's any of these base case scenario right now, I feel confident that we figure our way through it with without a lot of fallout. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in November. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding quarter. Thank you. We are forever grateful up here for what you guys do out there. And I guess, we'll talk to you sooner than November. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. In addition to Jessica, I'm pleased to be joined on the call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our D.R. Horton team finished the year strong. Pretax income for the fourth quarter increased 9% to $660 million on $5 billion of revenue and our pretax operating margin was 13.1%. For the year EPS increased 13% to $4.29 per diluted share and consolidated pretax income increased to $2.1 billion on $17.6 billion of revenues. Our consolidated pretax margin for the year was 12.1%. We closed 56,975 homes this year, an increase of over 5,000 homes or 10% from last year. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 18.1% and our return on equity was 17.2%. These results reflect the strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations in 2019 was $1.4 billion. Over the past five years, we have generated approximately $4 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our homebuilding revenues by more than $9 billion or 117% and our earnings per share by 186%. During these five years in addition to organically growing the business, we have invested approximately $1 billion on acquisitions and returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while reducing homebuilding debt by $1.3 billion. As a result, our return on equity increased by 540 basis points, while our homebuilding debt to capital ratio decreased by less than half of its level five years ago. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidating market share while growing both our revenues and pretax profits, generating strong cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes lots and lands to support growth and a good October sales base, we're well-positioned as we begin 2020. Mike? Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $1.35 per share compared to $1.22 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 8% to $505 million compared to $466 million. Our consolidated pretax income increased 9% to $660 million in the fourth quarter from $608 million, and homebuilding pretax income increased 3% to $594 million from $578 million. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $4.8 billion on 16,024 homes close, up from $4.4 billion on 14,674 homes closed in the year ago quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $299,500, flat with the prior year. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 14% to 13,130 homes, and the value of those orders was $4 billion, up 16% from $3.4 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 9% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Excluding the builders we acquired earlier this year, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 11% and our average number of active selling communities increased 2%. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $302,300, up 1% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 23%, down from 26% in the same quarter last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 21%, up 70 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from June to September exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to lower sales incentives. Based on today's market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be consistent with the fourth quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impact of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, SG&A expense as a percentage of homebuilding revenues was 8.5% compared to 8.4% from the prior year quarter. The increase in our fourth quarter SG&A year-over-year was primarily due to compensation accruals related to increases in our stock price. For the full year, homebuilding SG&A was 8.7% compared to 8.6% in 2018. We did not achieve SG&A leverage this year after we lowered our revenue growth expectations in our fiscal first quarter and worked to align our inventory levels and operations with our revised expectations throughout the year. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our growth and we expect to improve our SG&A rate in 2020.  Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $61 million and the pretax operating margin was 44.8%. For the year, financial services pretax income was $166 million on $442 million of revenues, representing a 37.6% pretax operating margin. 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 63% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with the DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 50% of closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 49% in the prior year quarter, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points for entry level buyers. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the year with 27,700 homes in inventory, essentially flat with last year 16,000 of our total homes were unsold, of which 5,200 were completed. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $990 million out of which $610 million was to replenish finish lots and land and $380 million was for land development. For the year, we invested $3.7 billion in lot, land and development. David? David Auld : At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 307,000 lots of which 40% were owned and 60% were controlled. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationships with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Mike? Mike Murray : Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, now operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At September 30th, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 38,300 lots of which 29,700 are owned and 8,600 are controlled through purchased contracts. 79% of Forestar\u2019s owned logs are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement. Forestar exceeded its guidance for this year by delivering 4,132 lots and generating $428 million of revenue for its fiscal year ended September 30th. Forestar expects to deliver 10,000 lots and generate $750 million to $850 million of revenue in fiscal 2020 and to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results. Forestar's making steady progress in building its operational platform and capital structure to support its significant growth plans. During the quarter, Forestar issued approximately $6 million of its common stock in a public offering. Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $100 million which will help support Forestar's future growth. After the issuance, D.R. Horton\u2019s ownership percentage of Forestar decreased from 75% to approximately 66%. Forestar plans to opportunistically access the capital markets as necessary to provide additional capital for long-term growth. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is targeting a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or less. We are excited about Forestar\u2019s growing operating platform and the value this relationship will create over the long term for both D.R Horton and Forestar\u2019s shareholders. David? David Auld : DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company, focused on suburban garden-style apartments with current operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. DHI Communities currently has four projects under active construction and two projects that were substantially complete at the end of the quarter, one of which was on a contract to sell at September 30th. During 2019, DHI Communities sold two multifamily rental properties for $133,400,000 and recorded a gain on sale of $51.9 million. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $204 million at the end of the year. We expect DHI Communities assets to increase significantly in 2020 as its pipeline of multifamily rental projects grows. We also expect to sell two rental properties in 2020. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results have increased our flexibility and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During fiscal 2019, cash generated by homebuilding operations was $1.4 billion, bringing our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past five years to approximately $4 billion. At September 30th, we had $2.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1 billion of unrestricted home building cash and $1.2 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facility. Our consolidated leverage improved 100 basis points from a year ago to 25.3%. And homebuilding leverage improved 440 basis points to 17%, the balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at fiscal year-end was $1.9 billion and we have $500 million of senior note maturities due in the next 12 months. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2024. We also extended the maturity date of our revolving credit facility by just over a year and increased its capacity to $1.59 billion. At September 30th, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $10 billion, and book value per share was $27.20, up 14% from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $55.5 million and repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $104.3 million. For the year, we paid cash dividends of $223.4 million and repurchased 11.9 million shares of common stock for $479.8 million. As a result of our share repurchases this year, we reduced our outstanding share count by 2% compared to a year ago. The Company's remaining stock repurchase authorization at September 30th was $895.7 million with no expiration date. Based on our financial positions and outlook for fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 17% to $0.175 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $250 million in fiscal 2020. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 12,100 and 12,400 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 21% and homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be around 9.5% of homebuilding revenues. Based on today's market conditions, our expected growth for fiscal 2020 is still in the mid to high single digit percentage range for both consolidated revenues and homes closed. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full year of $18.5 billion to $19 billion, and to close between 60,000 and 61,000 homes. We are forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2020 of approximately 25%, and we expect to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2020, compared to the end of fiscal 2019. We also expect to generate homebuilding cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion, again during fiscal 2020. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our well-established operating platform across the country. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. We are well-positioned to do so with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offerings across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position, and most importantly, our outstanding experienced team across the country. We congratulate the entire D.R. Horton team on closing the most homes in a year in company history, and we thank you for your hard work and accomplishments. We're incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first of all, the cash flow from operations target of greater than $1 billion could be interpreted as being somewhat conservative, given the 2019 performance of $1.4 billion, and what appears to be set up here for improved profitability in fiscal year \u201820. What do you see kind of as the biggest variables here? And is there any reason that you can point to why cash flow would be lower on a year-over-year basis? Bill Wheat : John, we expect to generate consistently strong cash flow in excess of $1 billion. Year-to-year that number can move around a little just depending on timing of investments and homebuilding, and given that were early in the year and we want to see how demand goes through the year that could impact our investment levels in the business. So, a greater than $1 billion is certainly a solid range and that gives us flexibility then as we move through the year and we\u2019ll update that estimate as we need to. John Lovallo : Okay. That makes sense. And then, last year, I think, you guys outlined potential acquisition target range of $400 million to $600 million. How are you guys thinking about that heading into 2020 and what does the pipeline look like? Bill Wheat : We\u2019re still actively looking at some opportunities, John. But, we're very selective and wanted to be very targeted in what we're doing there. So, while we're looking at some, they\u2019re very hard to predict when they are actually going to happen. This year, we don\u2019t have that same level of clarity to a number that we had at this time last year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on a strong close to the year. So, my first question, I\u2019ve always kind of thought about the homes and inventory data point that you guys provide is a little bit of leading indicator in terms of how you see the business growing over the next few quarters. And, I think, this is the first quarter in a while where you\u2019ve actually been down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And I'm just curious, as you think about that mid to high single digit growth targets in 2020, should we start to see that number move higher or is there any kind of change in the way you're thinking about having specs on the ground and homes in inventory, and maybe any shifts in demand for to-be-built homes versus spec that would be potentially driving that number lower than I would have suspected? Bill Wheat : I think, Alan, we're seeing it, similar breakdown between our to-be-builts and our available homes that we have in inventory. But, we're excited, looking at going into this year with a good demand environment and opportunity continue improving our returns and part of the way we\u2019ve talked about last quarter of improving returns is to focus on improving our home inventory turnover. And so, that\u2019s something we're excited about the opportunity to deliver on in fiscal \u201820. Alan Ratner : And then, I guess, just a follow-up on that but implied there I guess is you are still confident that you can maintain the very high backlog conversion rates that you've delivered in the past and while keeping a lower inventory level, and in total, is that the way to interpret that? Bill Wheat : I think you will see our inventory level increase from where we are at this point in the year. But, we're looking to be more efficient with the capital. So, we look to see a higher overall turnover rate. Alan Ratner : Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just ask one more. Investors, obviously, have been very focused on the 10-year treasury yield, which has been climbing off of recent lows off late and still incredibly low levels from an absolute standpoint. But, you mentioned the strong sales environment in October, which obviously coincides with that move up we've seen in recent weeks. How do you see the rate environment today? I mean, is there any -- would you see maybe pull forward from buyers that are trying to jump in before rates continue to move higher? Is it not a concern at all of yours in the marketplace? Any commentary you can give just in terms of what you're thinking about are seeing on the ground from the rate environment would be helpful. David Auld : I think, anything that impacts affordability is always going to be a concern. I will say, when you look at what drives homebuilding, which is job growth and overall economy, we feel very, very good about what's happening there. And homes, they're affordable as they're going to get. I do think yes, there may be a little bit of pull forward demand. But, right now, the market feels really, really good. Jessica Hansen : And Alan, it\u2019s one positive came out of last year at this time, and what we experienced, it was a renewed focus in the field for us to stay and make sure we have this affordable product offering, kind of regardless of what interest rates are doing. So, we continue to see our average square footage come down slightly. It was down about 3% on a year-over-year basis again. And we've proactively gotten the houses out there that we believe are affordable in today's market and will continue to adjust as necessary to whatever rate environment we find ourselves in. But, clearly, today is a little bit better rate environment than it was last year at this time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, all. I wanted to ask David a little bit about the competition especially for entry level in terms -- lots in particular, number of your peers are making a move in the direction that you made some time ago. And you've had a couple of smaller peers talk about how it's been harder to find assets out but they'd like to build smaller homes. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing competitively? Obviously, the lot supply is what it is and it\u2019s strong, but you'll be looking for more, they'll be more looking in the same area as you are. So, I was just curious as to your thoughts there. David Auld : Carl, we compete every day. And yes, I do think that you\u2019re seeing more people attempt to get lower in price point and drive better affordability. But again, like we've talked about in the past, our positions are very long, very deep. And we don't intend to give up market share and that -- so that\u2019s servicing that bar. I will say, demand is still very, very deep. And I think, from my travels that supply is still tight, especially as you achieve true affordability, so. But, we take a lot of comfort in the fact that we've got a long runway and very affordable position, deep and long, so. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Dave. And then, Bill, I want to follow up on Alan's question about inventories. I think, we made a few reclassifications to what's unsold versus we move models I think, but thinking back I think three years ago or so where you entered the year, feeling like you were short a little bit of inventory and it hurt you from a delivery perspective, I just want to make sure you are not feeling that way now, you feel comfortable the inventory you got in the ground as you head into this first quarter, is there -- and you\u2019re not feeling the same way that you did three years ago. Mike Murray : Paul, this is Mike. And I would say, it\u2019s different from three years ago that not just we feel really good about the focus we\u2019ve had on housing turns and how to improve that as well as having lots on the ground to support the starts that we\u2019ll need to be making over this quarter to support what we hope to be really robust spring selling season. So, three years ago, we were struggling not just with the inventory levels of housing, but also with our finished lot positions behind that. Jessica Hansen : And we feel very comfortable with the 60,000 to 61,000 annual target, but the reason we right now wouldn\u2019t say we're comfortable moving higher than that for this next fiscal is because where we're starting from a homes\u2019 perspective. So, 60 to 61, we feel very comfortable with. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : First, I wanted to touch on the SG&A. It came in a little bit above your guidance. Could you just walk us through the drivers of this and how we should think about incremental SG&A going forward? I'm really thinking about 2020. You mentioned some leverage. But, you guys are guiding mid to high single-digit revenue growth, which is pretty much what you all did in 2019 and your SG&A was kind of flattish. Could you kind of break it out why 2021 would improve while 2019 didn\u2019t necessarily tick down? Bill Wheat : Sure. Truman, this is Bill. Specifically, in the fourth quarter when we missed our guidance, that was specifically due to some of our compensation accruals are tied to changes in our share price. And as our stock price increased pretty sharply in the fourth quarter, we had to increase a number of those accruals, and that entirely accounts for the miss versus our guidance for the Q4 SG&A rate. As you look back over the full year of \u201819 and as we look forward to \u201820 though, it\u2019s a little bit of a broader discussion. As you recall, in fiscal 2019 at the start of the year, we had expectations to grow more to double-digit pace. But then, very early in the year as we saw softer market in the first quarter, we lowered our revenue expectations. But, we had our infrastructure in place and homes in place, homes and inventory obviously to support a higher revenue number. So, really throughout this year, we\u2019ve been working to adjust our inventory levels and our operations to kind of fit that lower revenue expectation. And we\u2019ve been running typically about 10 basis points higher than the prior year all year along. As we go into fiscal 2020, while we have the same revenue expectations that we ultimately achieved in \u201819, we feel like our positioning is appropriate for that revenue. And with mid to high single-digit revenue growth, we should see SG&A leverage. And so, we do expect to improve on our SG&A rate versus 2019 as we go into fiscal 2020. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then, on the financial services side, I think, it\u2019s the best result you guys have had in history. Could you just walk us through the drivers of this, and possibly, how sustainable it is going forward? Jessica Hansen : Sure. Truman, it was mainly due to favorable market conditions just because of low interest rate environment. So, that was by far the strongest driver. And our mortgage company though has also done a fantastic job working on becoming more efficient, they\u2019ve improved their capture rate. I think, 63% this quarter was one of the highest we\u2019ve seen in quite some time. But, normal historical operating margin is more in the 30% range, the low 30s. And we do anticipate that\u2019s what they\u2019re ultimately going to return to. But, no question this year was a very strong performance for that business. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. A question on gross margin, as you look at price and incentives and gross margin, curious how you would compare your thinking for the coming year relative to the year you just completed? Bill Wheat : I think, we're going to see frankly, Eric, more the same. We see lower levels of incentives than where we've been sequentially through the year, margins have come up nicely, as we walk from the second quarter low that we've had. We've been very intentional about trying to manage that to drive the best returns. And looking into fiscal 2020, as clear as plan all shows, this -- we\u2019re expecting margins to be about flat kind of where we've been in the fourth quarter. Eric Bosshard : And then, secondly, in terms of Forestar and option, can you talk about the progress you've made and where that number is going, and how it's going, you would -- how you would characterize how it's going? Mike Murray : Overall, we feel really well about the progress we've made to get to 60%. I know that's a little bit bouncy quarter-to-quarter. And we\u2019ve talked about, it's a dynamic number that measured in any quarter and it's going to move a little bit directionally. I hope to get a little more progress on that this year, and the trend continues. Forestar continues to add to their operating platform, add their team, which is a great first source for us, for a third-party developer. And at the same time, we work really hard developing relationships with other third-party developers as well, and continuing to expand those relationships that we have in various markets. And getting people in markets, we have not historically been able to get developers to step in and complete lots for us. It's an ongoing, long-term process. Eric Bosshard : And the destination ultimately, the 60%, where would you like that number to get to and over what time frame? Mike Murray : Hard to say, an ultimate number, higher than where it is today. But it's something we'll probably be working at very hard for our entire careers here at D.R. Horton. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much, guys. Mike, just wanted to clarify one thing, you just said I think with respect to margins in 2020 that you're thinking you could probably be flat with where you were in 4Q \u201819. So, in other words, kind of around that 21% gross margin in 2020 is kind of what you're thinking. Right? Mike Murray : Yes, sir. Stephen Kim : Okay, great. I just wanted to clarify that. That's great. The second question relates to SG&A. So, I believe, Bill, you were talking about the impact of the stock-based compensation in 4Q, your September quarter, you made adjustment to your accruals for the higher stock price. I was wondering if -- there shouldn't be any lingering impact from that. Let's say, if your stock price would remain flat into next year, should there -- the reason I'm asking is because 1Q guide on SG&A is for flat, even though your closings are up about 7%, just kind of like what you're thinking for the year. So, just trying to figure out why we wouldn't seem a little more leverage in 1Q, like you're expecting to see for the full year? Bill Wheat : Right. Yes, the change in the accrual should not have any lingering effect that you are correct in that assumption. As we look at our absolute level of SG&A spend going into the first quarter along with our revenue guide, we believe 9.5% is the level that we feel like we will be at. If you do go back a year ago though if you're comparing year-over-year, in the first quarter, we had some, I hate to say benefit, but we did have some benefit from a reduction in our stock price last year. So, some of those accruals were pulled down a year ago in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s simply timing on that basis, but it does move the needle a bit. It can move to 10 to 20 basis points. Stephen Kim : Got it. Yes. That's very clear. And then, lastly, I think, in your opening remarks, you talked about October off to a strong start. I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more. Are we seeing in any way an acceleration into October in anyway, either in terms of being able to reduce incentives at a more aggressive pace or any other kind of color you can provide around the demand environment in October? David Auld : This October feels so much better than last October\u2026 Stephen Kim : Sure. David Auld : It\u2019s hard not to be a little bit excited about what the year brings. I can tell you we're not thinking that we\u2019re going to see a margin expansion because I do believe there is going to be more competition. But, where we see the business right now today is very, very solid and feel comfortable, at least today with sharing that -- we are looking for pretty flat margins going forward. As you know, we\u2019re not typically the most optimistic group out there. Stephen Kim : Right, but just the hardest working. I appreciate it, guys. David Auld : Yes, sir. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Bouley : I want to start with the question on the Q1 gross margin guide consistent with Q4. Can you just go through some of the sequential puts and takes in that? So, I guess, what are you guys assuming around incentives and direct costs, and perhaps if there is any purchase accounting that\u2019s still rolling off? Jessica Hansen : It\u2019s really just looking at kind of our core lot level gross margin and assuming all else remains equal, so really no impact, one way or another from warranty and litigation or interest or property taxes. Now, those can move the needle quarter-to-quarter but they are really hard to project. So, right now, they are approximately 21%, would assume those are relatively in the same range as they were in Q4. And then, we're able to maintain a flat pricing environment or a pricing environment that is increased at the same level as our cost. So, that\u2019s what we saw this quarter sequentially -- well, actually sequentially we saw an improvement because of the continued pullback on incentives, which we think we're through the most of. But, our revenues per square foot were up about 2%, stick and brick costs were up about 1%. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Thank you for that color, Jessica. And then, I want to ask about some of the regional trends as well because it looked like the South Central really accelerated. So, any elaboration if you guys are sort leaning into Texas again. You guys have seemingly pulled back a bit there the past couple of quarters. And then, I guess, any color on the West and California as well? Mike Murray : So, I think -- let me take second part of your question first. California and the west, we're seeing good sales trends out there. We've kind of refocused ourselves on maintaining affordability. And at the price points, we're offering our teams out there doing a great job executing for those buyers. And we're seeing the buyers respond. In Texas, it's home. We've been dominating here for a long time and we will continue to do so. And those communities are performing exceptionally well, great teams on those projects. And the economy is strong here. And the interest rate adjustments, as David mentioned before, helps affordability. But, we have always been focused on meeting that affordable need in the State of Texas. And we're seeing great response. David Auld : I'll just add that a lot of it\u2019s positioning. And I think coming into this year, we feel very good about the way we're positioned, and both really California with the price that we've been able to drive down to and in Texas with lots out in front of our building operation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on how you're thinking about growth next year. And what I mean by that, obviously you gave the guidance, much appreciated, and in line with your prior expectations. But, if you go back over the last 5, 10 years, you've had a couple of different initiatives that I think have really been extremely helpful in driving the growth and taking share around the Horton Express around the Emerald. I think, you've talked in the past about other strategic goals to allow for a consistent growth going forward, including the Freedom Homes, the active adult, maybe even getting deeper in the East footprint as areas of opportunity. I was curious, as you look over the next year or two, how prominent those areas of strategic focus will be or the role that it will play in allowing you to continue to reach higher heights? Obviously getting to 60,000, you are up now consistently for the last three or four years, you are going up, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 closings per year. So, I was just curious, as you look at the next year or two, achieving the next ladders up of growth, is that going to be more broad-based, this kind of market driven or do you see specific games in some of those strategic initiatives that you've talked about in the past? David Auld : I think, on the last call, Bill talked about the fact that we're only top 5, and -- yes, number 1 in 13, top 5 in 30, 32 markets. So, we've got a lot of -- a lot of runway in those markets. And as to the brands, we're trying to drive optionality for the buyers and to create a focus and product to meet everybody's needs in the market. So, I feel like we've got all kinds of runway to get better end markets. And we're not doing as good as we should be and offer products that everybody is going to want to buy. Jessica Hansen : So, Rehaut, in addition to product positioning and our current footprint and deepening our market share in our current footprint, we have continued to expand where we operate, and our market count this quarter actually moved from 87 markets up to 90. So, we continue to asses where those good permits and jobs and areas that are in the affordable housing on the ground which honestly is almost every market across the entire U.S. So, we will look to continue to expand our footprint as well. Mike Murray : And then, you did mention kind of the East and the Midwest. With our acquisitions a year ago in the Midwest, we\u2019re working with those teams and they\u2019re growing their platforms. There is opportunity for that to be a stronger contributor for growth for us going forward. And then, we\u2019ve talked about the Northeast, and we continue to day by day improve our operations there, and our teams are working hard. And we think that\u2019s going to be an increasing driver of our continued growth as well. Michael Rehaut : I guess, secondly, as you think about order growth or closings growth next year, this year, you kind of moved from sales pace being maybe flattish or slightly up to flat, and then this quarter excluding acquisitions you had more of a high single-digit type of growth, and that's consistent with a lot of the builders that have seen an improved market as well as an easier comp. As you get into next year, how should we expect the balance of community count and sales pace to influence the overall unit volume growth? Jessica Hansen : After we cycle through this next quarter, really that\u2019s when we acquired the three companies we did and really what has been putting our community count growth in that high single digit range. So, without those acquisitions, we\u2019ve been trending in that pretty low single digit range, only 1% or 2% on a year-over-year basis. And I think, we really just kind of anticipate more of the same in fiscal \u201820. So community count is slightly up, and it can be a little choppy along the way. Mike Murray : But, we are seeing as with our refocus on affordability and ensuring that we\u2019re driving that everywhere that we can, we're seeing improved absorption for community. And so with our guide of mid to high single digit growth on a community count of low single digit, we're assuming further improvement in per community sales price. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question. Megan McGrath : I guess, I wanted to ask, if you think about this fiscal year 2019, we went through a lot of movements in interest rates, up and down and ticking back up a little bit. But, I guess looking back, could you tell us that anything surprised you in terms of the reaction of your buyer group to those rate moves which have been debated for a while, what would happen? And if rates continue to pick up, is there anything you would do differently or just your strategy as we move forward? Mike Murray : Megan, we saw the buyers -- every time that affordability is constrained, the buyers have to readjust and there is certainly a pause in the marketplace. And interest rates are big driver of affordability. At the same time that as Jessica mentioned earlier, that gave us the real focus to get back into our product and think about what we are offering and try to bring housing prices down for our customers at a way that provides -- still provided a good margin for the Company, and we did that. And we\u2019ll continue to adjust to the marketplace for whatever the interest rate environment gives us. I do think one of the things that we are seeing is that there's continued job growth in the economy and there's some continued wage growth. And that's very helpful for households. And that large population, that large demographic is aging one year further down, and they're having life events that often drive them to prefer single family housing as their housing choice. And we're well-positioned to provide them with a home for that. Megan McGrath : Great, thanks. And then, just a follow-up on gross margin, and you talked about flattish from the fourth quarter. Could you maybe walk us through how you're thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds of the big components of gross margin as we look into next year, generally, labor materials and pricing? Jessica Hansen : So, it\u2019s really just more the same Megan. So, what we're saying in that guide is that we don't have the same level to pull back on incentives as we did this year. We will pretty much have cycled through the higher incentives that we had to institute last year at this time to drive a sales pace. So, we continue to have some limited cost pressures on the labor front that\u2019s consistently been somewhat of a headwind. But, we've worked to offset it in other categories. And generally, now that we've offset, cycled the higher lumber costs, our material costs are net neutral. Our purchasing team\u2019s doing a great job of when we do have a category that the cost is going up, they find a category where we can look to offset it. So, I think our base case would be just to be able to keep those costs in line with whatever type of pricing power or lack of pricing power we might have. As a reminder though, the really the fiscal 2020 gross margin is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season. And so, this is where we sit today. We feel good about maintaining our gross margin, around the range it is right now. But, it's really going to be dependent on the spring. Bill Wheat : As you know, we're focused first and foremost on returns. And so, we're going to balance margin, pricing, incentives and pays to generate the best return for community. Right now, we see a good market in front of us. And so, that would indicate we should be able to maintain margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : Hi. Good morning. Bill, I wanted to revisit the cash flow comment, I think from maybe the first leadoff question on the call. $1.4 billion this year, north of a $1 billion next year, the October issue, very nice refi of the February 2020 coming due. Is there anything around the cash flow guide contemplating the December 2020? I know, that\u2019s a 2%, that's a pretty attractive yield it\u2019s going to be probably hard to beat that. But, is any of that in the guide for cash flow for next year? Bill Wheat : No. That would be beyond our fiscal year. So, we're kind of looking at that as a fiscal 2021 event. So, naturally, with the 2.5% five-year notes we issued in October that does essentially provide the funds to refi and payoff the maturity that we have in the spring, the $500 million we have in the spring. So, that gives us flexibility in our liquidity as we go into the year to invest further or be able to be opportunistic as we need to. Jack Micenko : Okay, great. And then, on DHI Communities, can you maybe help us size what those gains \u2013 obviously, it's a market transaction deal, so not looking for ZIP code, but maybe area code around maybe gains, timing. And then 2b of the question, thoughts on single family rental. There are some going that way and among your peers, someone have said it\u2019s not really for us. Just curious as you're growing the rental business overall, where your current thinking is on the single family side? Thanks. Bill Wheat : So, DHI Communities, we mentioned, we do expect to sell another two projects in fiscal 2020. One of which is under contract to sell as of September 30th. So, we would expect the first project to close in our first fiscal quarter, and then, we expect one more over the course of the year. Little hard to comment on individual transactions around the size of potential gains until they close. But, our projects are ranging in size from high 200 units up to up to 350 to 400 units in general. And so, they are in a fairly tight range in terms of size. So, I would expect significant variations versus the ones we saw this past year. And then, in terms of single family rental? Mike Murray : We're continuing to look at that business, Jack. We think it's -- we have an opportunity to provide some value in that space, and we're looking for the best way we can do that right now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : I certainly understand with the strong backlog you\u2019ve got good visibility on next six months, whatever margin et cetera. I guess, I was a little surprised that when talking about labor and materials, you wouldn\u2019t potentially be anticipating more pressure as we get to later into next year, given the order growth that we\u2019ve been seeing, and given some of the inventory dynamics, which affected you this year and probably the industry as well, which would suggest there is going to be more stress on the home building complex, and so more stress on labor in particular. Any further thoughts on how you are thinking about that in your ability to be in a position? Because it sounded like it wasn't so much that you\u2019d be raising but you thought that those wouldn\u2019t be material impacts to your year ahead. Bill Wheat : So, part of the confidence we have in our cost outlook is looking lot of a national contracts we have from our scale. Secondarily, at a local level the scale we have certainly supports great labor relationships that we've had over the years and our ability to continue to source adequate labor to build our homes on a timely fashion is very constructive for us. And there is cost pressure because the market is strong. We would also expect that there is a potentially a lower level of incentives that would help us mitigate any of those cost leakages that we had through. David Auld : I\u2019ll just add that we worked very, very hard over the years to drive a process that has allowed us to drive more square footage with the same labor hours. And that gives us a lot of comfort and confidence that when labor does get tied again, which I anticipate it will in the spring that we are going to command the greatest percentage of it. Mark Weintraub : And maybe just as follow-on, did you think your local market scale access is in even bigger advantage in that type of market than what we\u2019ve been seen, and how does that play out? David Auld : Well, absolutely. I think, it\u2019s a local market scale. I think it\u2019s also our commitment to drive a consistent production at each flag. So, we get the trade base into the communities. Our absorption in our typical community is very, very high. So, we're keeping that. And they are not looking for work while they are waiting on us to start houses. It\u2019s just a process. It\u2019s something we've been working on for a long, long, long time. And I think, we do have both, a loyal trade base and good markets bad markets. I know they're going to get paid. So, that is a competitive advantage for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ken Zener : Let\u2019s start with intra quarter order closings please. What percent of closings were intra quarter orders closings? Jessica Hansen : It was right where we typically expected in call it 35%, 36% range. It fluctuates anywhere from 30% to 40%, on average, and with a little bit of seasonality sometimes. Ken Zener : Right. So, if I do that calculation, first, what I believe was 34% last year, what that shows is your closings were up about 7% of your backlog. That's a nice cadence, but really spiked in the spec homes, year-over-year, if you just look at it at units. I ask that to get an understanding of how the margins for your spec first backlog are trending with a third of your closings being spec in an environment where pricing became firmer. Could you kind of talk about that a little bit? Mike Murray : We saw spec margins compressed or get closer to backlog margin. So, they came up relative to backlog margins. That difference shrunk in the quarter\u2026 Ken Zener : And what would you attribute that to? Mike Murray : As what you said, it was a firmer pricing environment, a lower incentive environment in our fiscal fourth quarter than it was say in the fiscal second quarter. Ken Zener : Now, the guidance you gave for revenue, you talked about feeling good in October. Nice. It seemed though like -- it seems like you guys -- except for the first quarter, you guys have really been kind of following what I would consider normal seasonal trends. And then, Bill, I think, you said you expect pace to actually increase in FY20. Was I mistaken? Bill Wheat : We do, we\u2019re expecting our community count to be up low single digit, but our overall pace to be up mid to high single digit. Yes. Ken Zener : Why is that? What gives you that confidence is what I'm asking to expect seasonality to accelerate on a order pace basis? Bill Wheat : Just in general, we would expect that on an annual basis, as we've seen that as we're refocusing on providing attainable housing for people that we\u2019re able to see communities perform at a higher sales per flag per week pace than other communities. I mean, so, it's something that we\u2019ve consistently seen for the past several years is that as these communities open, we're positioning them with the right inventory to get going out of the gate strong and run at very high absorption rates. Mike Murray : And I would agree with you, Ken. We're not seeing anything different than normal seasonality though, necessarily. We do expect we can run a little bit tighter on our housing inventory in fiscal \u201820 than we did in \u201819. We started strong and as we adjusted our revenue expectations, we've kind of spent a year adjusting to align. But, we thought we\u2019re very well aligned going into fiscal 2020. David Auld : I\u2019ll just add, our confidence level is really driven by what we\u2019re seeing out in the field. And we talk a lot about our people. We talk a lot about trying to get better year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter, day-over-day really. And I would just say we are getting better. So, even though our absorption per flag has been very high through this whole cycle, we are a better company today than we were a year ago, better positioned and our people got another year\u2019s experience. Ken Zener : Understanding it appears that way for your results. Can you talk about how you\u2019re trying to control your user side vis-\u00e0-vis vendors and if you\u2019re seeing whether it\u2019s lumber, appliances or these types of other things, perhaps what you\u2019ve learned over the last year and any changes that you\u2019re implementing for FY20? Thank you very much. Bill Wheat : I think, we're continuing to do what we have done with a lot of our national supply partners, and they\u2019re creating a good relationship for us and for them providing a lot of consistent volume demand and potential halo effect into a given marketplace by bringing their product into the trade base. There are some follow-on benefits and we participate in that and they certainly benefit from it as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Barron with Housing Research Center. Please proceed with your question. Alex Barron : I was curious whether you guys feel the growth in the overall industry is going to be pretty much in line with the growth you guys are guiding to. Bill Wheat : Yes. Alex, I would think, we would continue to expect to take market share, and as we like to say, outperform the market, year in, year out, we expect to do better. Alex Barron : Okay. So, does that mean you expect your affordable percentage of homes to I guess keep growing? Jessica Hansen : You may not see it from a pure brand perspective in our business, but what we\u2019ve been introducing really over the last year or so is more and more entry level type houses in our Horton brand as well. So, the answer is yes, but you may not see our Express percentage of a business, climb from the mid-30s, where it is today. Alex Barron : Got it. And then, in your financial services segment, you guys got pretty nice leverage this quarter, do you expect that to continue in 2020? Bill Wheat : Yes. We certainly have seen some improvement in efficiencies, their cost for loan is down, they\u2019ve increased their capture rate, which provides efficiencies on overhead as well. But, a large part of the expansion margin is due to very favorable market conditions as rates drop for this year. The service release premiums are very healthy and that sort of a market and there is less competition from because there is more refi business out there. So, we wouldn\u2019t expect to sustain the same level of level margins, they should come down a bit. But, we're pleased with the continued efficiencies we're building into that business. David Auld : And I\u2019ll just add, our mortgage company did a spectacular job this year, not only driving efficiency through their process but in aligning with our homebuilding operations to make the overall transaction better for our customers. Alex Barron : Okay. And one last one if I may on the Forestar. As you guys are now incurring interest due to the debt you raised, is that going to be capitalized or is that going to be showing up in expenses in what you guys report? Bill Wheat : Yes. Forestar, their active inventory is greater than their debt. So, they are capitalizing 100% of their interest into their inventory at Forestar. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning will come from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is actually Chris on from Mike. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, my first question is just on M&A. Are you embedding any M&A in your 2020 guidance? And given the recent activity in the space, could you just give us an update how you\u2019re thinking about public versus private opportunities? Bill Wheat : We are not embedding any M&A activity into our growth guidance. With regard to our outlook for M&A, for what's right for Horton, typically, it's been the private builders, the add-on builders that give us new capabilities, new teams in various markets. So, that's where we\u2019ll continue to have our focus right now. But, we are always open and are always evaluating whatever is right -- going to be right for us. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks for that. And secondly, are you be able to provide the percentage of communities that raised price this quarter, and any regional color, commentary you can provide on pricing power you saw in 4Q? Jessica Hansen : So, the communities we've raised price on isn't something we typically disclose. We clearly still don't have broad based pricing power across the board. But, I would say, at this point, we've had an ability to pull back on incentives, which is a different function of price, across most of our footprint at this point, maybe a little bit less so at the higher price points where incentives have remained elevated. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Auld for any final comments. David Auld : Thank you, Melissa. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to talking to you again in January to share our first quarter results. And to the D.R. Horton team, congratulations on finishing number one for the 18th consecutive year. You are truly the best of the best in this industry. Mike, Bill, Jessica and I are honored and humbled to represent you on these calls. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

In addition to Jessica, I\u2019m pleased to be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team started the year off strong. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 39% to $523 million on a 14% increase in revenue to $4 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 230 basis points to 13%, and our net sales orders increased 19%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 18.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 18.2%. These results reflect strength of our operational teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. We continue to see a good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, while economic fundamentals and financing availability remain strong -- solid, excuse me. Our strategic focus is to continue consolidated market share, while growing our revenues and profits, generating strong annual cash flows and returns, and maintaining a flexible financial position with a conservative balance sheet that includes an ample supply of homes, lots and lands for growth. We are well-positioned for the remainder of 2020 and future years. Mike? Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 53% to $1.16 per share, compared to $0.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 50% to $431 million, compared to $287 million. Our first quarter results included tax benefit of $32.9 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated. Our consolidated pretax income increased 39% to $523 million in the first quarter and our homebuilding pretax income increased 30% to $462 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 13% to $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed, up from $3.4 billion on 11,500 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 1% from last year to $298,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 19% to 13,126 homes and the value of those orders was $3.9 billion, up 22% from $3.2 billion in the prior year. Our significant sales price increase over the prior year quarter reflects the moderation in demand that occurred in late calendar 2018. Our average number of active selling communities increased 6% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $300,900, up 3% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 20% compared to 24% in the same quarter last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 21%, flat sequentially from the September quarter, up 100 basis points compared to the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be consistent with the first quarter, subject to possible fluctuations due to product and geographic mix, as well as the relative impacts of warranty, litigation and purchase accounting. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 9.2%, down 30 basis points from 9.5% in the prior year quarter. We remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our growth. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the first quarter with 30,200 homes in inventory. 18,400 of our total homes were unsold of which 5,600 were completed. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.3 billion, of which $890 million was for purchases of land and finished lots, while $410 million was for land development. Our underwriting criteria and operational expectations for new communities remained consistent at a minimum 20% annual pre tax return on inventory and return of our initial cash within 24 months. David? David Auld : At December 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 320,000 lots of which 39% were owned and 61% were controlled through purchase contracts. 33% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 56% of our controlled lots are will be finished when we purchase them. We continue working to increase our lot position being developed by third parties by supporting the growth of Forestar\u2019s national lot manufacturing platform and expanding our relationship with lot developers across the country. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide a strong competitive advantage. Mike? Mike Murray : Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly-traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 51 markets across 20 states. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 44,500 lots of which 32,200 are owned and 12,300 our controlled through purchase contracts. 80% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under the master supply agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, Forestar delivered 2,422 lots and is on track to deliver 10,000 lots in fiscal 2020 and generate $800 million to 850 million of revenue. Forestar expects to deliver 12,000 lots and generate $900 million to $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2021. These expectations are for Forestar\u2019s standalone results. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and is committed to maintaining a long-term net debt to capital ratio of 40% or lower. At December 31st, Forestar\u2019s net debt to capital ratio was 9.7%. Forestar has approximately $720 million of liquidity to fund its continued growth, which includes $370 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. Forestar hosted their quarterly earnings call last Thursday and have an updated presentation on their Investors site and investor.forestar.com that describes Forestar\u2019s unique lot manufacturing model, and a significant growth and value creation opportunity. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the first quarter increased 29% to $30.5 million and the pretax profit margin was 29.6%, up from 27.7% in the prior year. 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations during the quarter related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 65% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 49% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 50% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points for entry level buyers. David? David Auld : DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused suburban garden-style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold its third apartment project located in Phoenix for $61.5 million and recognized a gain on sale of $31.2 million. DHI Communities has four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. DHI Communities\u2019 total assets were $210 million at December 31st. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being flexible, opportunistic and disciplined. Our balance sheet strength and operating results are providing increased flexibility, and we are utilizing our strong position to enhance the long-term value of the Company. During the first three months of fiscal 2020, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $178.4 million, compared to $396.8 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $2.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.4 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.5%. The balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion. And we have $500 million of senior notes maturing on February 15th, which we plan to repay, utilizing cash on hand and our revolving credit facility, as necessary. At December 31st, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $10.2 billion and book value per share was $27.92, up 14% from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64.6 million. We also repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $163.1 million, resulting in $732.6 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization at December 31, 2019. Our outstanding share count was down 2%, year-over-year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in a range of $4.25 billion to $4.4 billion and to close approximately 13,800 to 14,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 21% and homebuilding SG&A in the second quarter to be around 9% of homebuilding revenues. Based on today\u2019s market conditions and our first quarter results, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full year of $18.5 billion to $19.1 billion and to close between 60,000 and 61,500 homes. We expect our income tax rate in the second, third and fourth quarters to be between 23% and 24%. We still expect to generate cash flow from homebuilding operations in excess of $1 billion for the full fiscal year of 2020, and we expect our outstanding share count to be down approximately 2% at the end of the year, compared to the end of fiscal 2019. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our well-established operating platform across the country. We are focused on consolidating market share while growing our revenues and profits and generating strong annual cash flows and returns while maintaining a flexible financial position. Our return on equity of 18.2% and our homebuilding return on inventory of 18.7%, demonstrate our consistent focus and efforts. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue this performance with our conservative balance sheet, broad geographic footprint, affordable product offering across multiple brands, attractive finished lot and land position and most importantly, our outstanding experienced teams across the country. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live. Carl Reichardt : I wanted to ask something you guys often have talked about is the idea of getting your cash back out of your investments in land within two years. And with some of your peers moving to some of the products and markets that you serve, I\u2019m just curious as to your perspective, David, on the land market in general for affordable homes and your ability to continue to run the model where you\u2019re getting cash out in two years. David Auld : Well, the cash out in two years is something we stayed with through this -- from the downturn on. And I can tell you that that model has worked very well for us. And I don\u2019t see that changing. And as to the overall market for buying land, again, it comes back to the people we have embedded in these markets and relationships they have with the land\u2019s owners. And we feel very good about our opportunity to replace what we\u2019re building through, and through this market have seen that happen over and over and over again, so. Carl Reichardt : And then, on similar lines with looking like starts are going to pick up with orders strong for lots of folks, I\u2019m curious as to your perspective on the labor market, subs in particular, and what you\u2019re seeing and thinking about in terms of the potential for increases in cost there this year, as these orders get built out? David Auld : I think, there\u2019s always going to be that pressure on the cost side. Definitely, labor is getting tighter and continues to -- I think going to restrict a lot of people\u2019s ability to deliver houses. Again, it goes back to the kind of operating profile we adopted and continue, and that is consistent starts throughout the community, expanding the labor base, the efficiency, not necessarily just bodies. And we feel very good about what we\u2019ve accomplished. We have a very loyal trade base. I think I said on the last call, our traders don\u2019t have to go chase their paychecks. So, all of that combines to put us in a great position. Is it going to be a problem? I think less so for us than other people. Operator : Our next question is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : First one on the order ASP over -- a little bit over 300,000 in the quarter, that was up pretty nicely a year-over-year. And I know you mentioned that there\u2019s some normalization off of a challenging period last year. But just curious, if we kind of break down that number, is that kind of regional and product mix driven, or are you taking pricing on a like-for-like basis? Jessica Hansen : Part of it is regionally driven. If you look at our orders this year, the South Central was down 2% in terms of just the mix, the overall mix, and that\u2019s actually our lowest ASP region. So, we continue to expect just modest sale price increases as we move throughout the year, and to cover our costs increases, but on the like-for-like basis nothing significant in the way of price. John Lovallo : And then, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the Forestar investment. If the plan is to kind of continue to dilute your stake through issuing equity out of Forestar, or are you now considering -- or any plan to potentially sell down your actual ownership position? Mike Murray : Yes. We\u2019re still on track with our plan there John to ultimately deconsolidate Forestar. We were pleased when they were able to issue their first primary equity offering in September, which diluted our position down from the original 75%; here in December, we\u2019re sitting at 65%. We would expect additional equity issuances from Forestar over time that could continue to dilute our position. And then, as we\u2019ve also said all along, there\u2019s a potential that we could sell some of our shares. And at the point in time that we are ready to do that, we will have a plan in place that will complement the primary equity issuance. And those two things together would result in further dilution in our ownership position. Operator : Our next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : So, first one, I think last quarter you guys commented just when you thought about the full-year, your best guess at that point would be that gross margins would be kind of similar in that 21% range. And you obviously hit that this quarter and 2Q guide is similar as well. So, just first off, is there any change in your thinking in terms of the progression in margins through the year, obviously very strong sales environment? So, how should we think about as the year progresses, what happens to margin? David Auld : I think, we\u2019re going to see consistent margins into the second quarter. And then frankly, as usual this time of the year, the spring selling season will really dictate where margins go in Q3 and Q4. Early returns in the spring selling season have been very positive. So, we\u2019re confident in giving our guidance of consistent margins in the Q2, but we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what happens in the next several weeks. Alan Ratner : Second question, if I look at your homes in inventory, that\u2019s been -- at least on a year-over-year basis has been trending lower for the last several quarters. I think this quarter you\u2019re down about 10% year-over-year. And obviously, last year was elevated a bit because of the sales -- the tougher sales environment. But, are you seeing a greater component of sales coming from to be built, or have you changed your thinking -- your thought process at all in terms of the optimal number of specs per community that would be translated into that type of decline we\u2019re seeing, or are you trying to amp that higher as the spring gets underway? David Auld : A couple of things going on with that number, Alan. One, the comparison to prior year, we\u2019re actually down 5%. We\u2019ve changed the way we report homes and inventory to exclude the model homes. So, last year, we were -- where we were last year, like 31,800; and so, this year, we are at 30,200. So, we\u2019re down slightly from last year. And last year may have been a bit elevated with softer sales and operating environment we saw in the fourth calendar quarter of \u201818. Another thing we\u2019ve talked about is getting better at turning our housing inventory to drive a higher return with those investment dollars. And then, we\u2019re also seeing the ability to push starts in as we\u2019re seeing demand come on. We\u2019re not noticing any kind of a difference in the mix between to be built versus our spec starts, continuing probably an 80-20 consistent approach for that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : First question I had for you is on the land spend. The land spend was fairly high relative to our expectations this quarter. I\u2019m talking specifically on the acquisition number of 890. [Ph] And as a percentage of rev, that was probably the highest we\u2019ve seen in six years. And, given your discipline and given your outlook on the business and your intention to basically get a return on that spend within 24 months, it seems that there\u2019s a fair amount of optimism that\u2019s implied by that strong land spend. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that, maybe break that down for us, at least qualitatively, in terms of was that kind of a strong land spend fairly equally distributed across the country where there are certain opportunities that emerged in a particular region or a particular product type that garnered a lion share of that? If you could just talk about the relatively strong land spend in greater detail? Mike Murray : Sure, Stephen. As you know, you start your land spend, there is some lumpiness kind of from quarter-to-quarter. And so, one quarter, just based on the timing of when deals close and when they get ready to go and based on our business plans, there can be a bit of lumpiness there. One thing I would point out is that over half of our land acquisition spend is for finished lots. And so, we continue to dedicate a lot of our spend to finished lots which turn very quickly. And so I would really just attribute -- I wouldn\u2019t say there is necessarily any changes in our plans, but I would attribute a bit of this to a bit of a lumpiness, point out that finished lots are a heavy part of the spend. But, then we do -- we are optimistic. We do see growth, certainty in fiscal \u201820. And right now, we still see very good underlying fundamentals for the business. And so, we are still actively replenishing our land and lot supply. Jessica Hansen : And we have to replenish it at a faster rate as we continue to grow our sales and closings pace. You have seen our owned lot count remained relatively flat for quite some time. So, it\u2019s really just a function of having to replenish at a faster rate. Stephen Kim : Great. Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Second question relates to the broader macro environment or rather the broader environment with respect to housing policy. We\u2019ve seen some interesting moves here as of late. We have seen the average DTIs, the high DTIs and high LTV lending be curtailed or reined back the FHFA. And yes, we\u2019ve also heard that CFPD weigh in here and suggest they\u2019re going to move to an APOR spread versus the DTI. I was curious as to whether or not you have looked into this. Some of what we\u2019ve heard is that the move to the APOR spread would actually be stimulative to entry-level housing, on top of the dropping rates. That would seem to be extremely favorable for your business. And I was curious if you had looked at that at all. And if you have any view on whether or not these broader factors may be positive for your business the way it would appear to us? Jessica Hansen : Sure. High level, I think we\u2019d agree with what you\u2019re saying. That being said, it\u2019s super early and out there and it\u2019s not something that we spend a lot of time on. I\u2019m sure our mortgage company would have a much more detailed response for you. But anything that continues to improve mortgage standards and makes it easier for people to get into a house clearly would be a benefit for our business. That being said, as David mentioned in his opening, financing availability is still good. I mean people that should be buying houses are who are buying houses today. And we\u2019re not necessarily in favor of people with significantly high DTIs or really low credit scores being in a house because we\u2019re very cognizant of what happened last cycle, and we don\u2019t want any repeat of that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Truman Patterson : So, your guidance is for mid to high single digit closing growth. You\u2019ve bumped up the high end a little bit. But, is there anything structurally limiting you from going above the high end of that guidance, particularly on the land side and thinking availability of lots, your ability to get lots developed? And that also includes municipality constraints, delaying community openings that might create any kind of gap-outs? Mike Murray : Truman, we\u2019re really excited about the way this year started off the first quarter and through the first several weeks of January, and we have increased our guidance as a result of that. Structurally, it\u2019s a question of the lots that are out in front of us. We feel good about the community positioning we have, getting some communities opened. But right now, we\u2019re not going to increase our guidance, based on where we are today in the spring selling season. But, we will certainly look to deliver all the homes we can. That\u2019s the best returns we can do in fiscal \u201820. Truman Patterson : Okay. So, put another way, there\u2019s nothing structurally limiting you on the land side from going above that if the market is a bit healthier than what you expect as of today? Mike Murray : There is a finite number of homes we can build over the next 8.5, 9 months and deliver by September 30th. But, we\u2019re comfortable with our guidance range today, and we\u2019re just going to have to see what the spring is going to give us and where we end up in our inventory positioning in March and in April and May. Jessica Hansen : Our guidance already incorporates a higher housing inventory turnover than what we did last year. So, it reflects an improvement in terms of building, selling and closing more houses this year than last year, which is what we continue to be focused on is there\u2019s efficiencies in the business. But that is what limits further upside to our current guidance. Truman Patterson : Okay. And then, sticking on the land side. Your option lots jumped nicely this quarter, as you all continue rotating towards more option land, how should we think about where that growth comes from? Is it primarily through Forestar? Is it more than even balance between Forestar and your third-party developers? And then, any way you can put out a target over the next couple of years, what you think you can get that option land bank as a percentage of total up to? David Auld : We\u2019re not going to set a hard target. Internally, we talk about goals, but that\u2019s an internal conversation. And it\u2019s kind of a balanced program. I think, the Forestar platform is again built out. We\u2019re very happy with the progress we\u2019re making there. But, we are also equally focused on our third-party developers. And they are a part of the D.R. Horton family. And that pipeline continues to get better and bigger. And so, it\u2019s a collection of the two. Primarily, it\u2019s just focus. We\u2019re treating capital as if it\u2019s a precious commodity. And we\u2019re going to try to treat it better than anybody else in the industry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I wanted to ask on the SG&A side, since your guidance implies sort of flat percentage year-over-year, although you are growing the top line and kind of managing that inventory positioning. Is there any reason why we wouldn\u2019t see a bit more leverage? And how should we think about that beyond the next quarter? Thank you. Bill Wheat : To the extent we\u2019re delivering on our closings guidance and showing mid to high single digit growth in revenue, we do expect to see leverage on our SG&A and improvement year-over-year. We\u2019re very pleased with the 30 basis points we saw in the first quarter. Based on what we see today and the volume we see in Q2, we do expect SG&A to be relatively flat with last year in Q2. But overall, we do expect some leverage for the year. Matthew Bouley : Okay. I appreciate that. And then, as you just mentioned, I believe to the prior question, your guidance for the Q2 closings does imply kind of a continued uptick on that conversion of your inventory positioning. But, you did also mention earlier that labor is kind of not surprisingly getting tighter. So, can you speak a bit about that balance? And what exactly are you guys doing on the ground that supports that improving efficiency? Thank you. David Auld : It gets back to -- to me, it gets back to relationships with trade base. And for the last, I don\u2019t know, ever since the downturn, we\u2019ve had a steady and consistent level of production going in our communities. And so, our trade base has gotten better at building the houses. And when they\u2019re not out there chasing work, then they can build more houses. What I look at is the same labor. We build more square footage with the same labor hours. So, it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked on all the way through this cycle. I think early on, we felt like labor was going to be the constraint on housing. And we have done I think a great job of managing the trade base and making sure that those guys were making money. And we were still delivering houses at a reasonable cost. Mike Murray : Matt, the other thing we look at here and we watch sort of from a high level perspective is what our build times are doing in our process when we start a house, can we get it completed and then closed. And we\u2019re not seeing those times elongate, which would be real, more acute indicators of labor shortages in various markets. So, the longstanding deep relationships we have with a lot of the labor suppliers, combined with a more efficient plan set, if you will, in our communities and focus on the first time homebuyer and affordability, has driven our ability to continue to turn houses a little bit better, and we\u2019re going to see a lot of improvement in that metric this year. Operator : Our next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Michael Rehaut : First question I had was on your outlook for the year for community count and sales pace. I believe last quarter you talked about, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019d expect community count -- average community count for the year to be up year-over-year, low single digits. I was wondering if that\u2019s still the expectation. I believe it\u2019s been flat sequentially more or less for last few quarters, but I guess the expectation would be to drift upward a little bit. And then, also on the sales pace, you had a nice improvement year-over-year. And I was just curious, if that was more driven by market conditions or certain product or geographic mix shifts, and how you think about the next quarter or two? Jessica Hansen : Sure. So, when we think about community count, Mike, it\u2019s the hardest one for us to predict, quite honestly, which is why we never give formal guidance on it. I think, our base case would be that we would anticipate it to tick up at some point, as we move throughout the year. But when that inflection point actually happens, it\u2019s hard to call exactly. In terms of the sales pace, as we mentioned in the script, that does reflect the moderation in demand we saw in late calendar 2018. So, we did have -- although we generally don\u2019t talk about comps, we did have a relatively easy comp, when you look at that. And what our guidance reflects for the year from a closings perspective would infer that our sales year-over-year increase is going to moderate from Q1 and it will fluctuate Q2, Q3, Q4 in a range that supports that closings growth guidance that we\u2019ve alluded to. Michael Rehaut : I guess, secondly, bigger picture, kind of maybe piggybacking off an earlier question of owned versus option. Maybe said a different way, your lot option percentage has obviously while huge amounts of progress, impressive progress over the last few years, now, it\u2019s kind of been in that low-60s type of range, 60 to 61, 62, maybe over the last 3, 4 quarters. That increase over the last few years has been a big, big driver of your improved return profile. Just trying to get a sense of over the next 2 or 3 years, certainly, you\u2019re not going to do the same type of degree of change on the lot option profile, as you have before, maybe you\u2019ll drift up a little bit. I do recall you guys talking about a 70% number perhaps, but maybe now that\u2019s not as concrete. But, how should we think about, over the next two or three years, the next big lever of improvement in returns? Would it be more from a share repurchasing standpoint or are other levers that perhaps we\u2019re not thinking about? Mike Murray : We expect it to be just continued incremental improvement on all for us. We do expect to continue to -- and our goal is to continue to push an option percentage upward. We\u2019re not going to set necessarily an upward target. But, we do expect to incrementally improve that as Forestar grows, build out its platform even further, that\u2019s going to continue to be part of that growth story as well as expanding relationships with our developers. We\u2019ve already alluded to on this call we\u2019re expecting to turn our housing inventory faster this year. And so, that\u2019s going to be an incremental level in terms of returns this year. And then, as our operations are more efficient and generate more cash that gives us more flexibility on the capital allocation side. And so, over the last several years, we have instituted an increasing level of share repurchases and dividend payoffs to shareholders, which has enhanced our ROE. And so, as we continue to incrementally improve each year, I think each one of those levers is going to allow us to continue to incrementally improve both operational returns and returns to shareholders. Operator : Your next question today is coming from Jack Micenko from SIG. Your line is now live. Jack Micenko : I wanted to revisit the pace question a little bit more. The 1Q here, this is I think the -- probably the high watermark since the crisis on sales pace. And I\u2019m curious the guide would suggest that pace will continue to improve through the year, maybe at a slower clip. But, the improvement, looking past year-over-year with the easy comps, but the improvement over the last four or five quarters, is that all product segmentation, or are you seeing lift across all your product types? I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any regional differential that can drive maybe incremental pace, improvement through the latter half of this year, maybe in the next year? Mike Murray : I think, we\u2019re seeing generally increased absorptions at our more affordable price points, whether that\u2019s the entire community or certain plans within more the traditional Horton branded communities. We are not heavily exposed to the luxury end of the market. So, we\u2019re not experiencing if there is any lift there or not lift going on there. We can speak to that very well. But, across all of our geographies, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the traffic, pretty good about the demand, in the most recent quarter and in the quarters leading up to it. Jack Micenko : And then, maybe the January trend the last couple of weeks, would it be consistent what we saw in the fiscal first or does that build sort of continue in the most recent couple weeks? Mike Murray : I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve seen normal seasonality week-to-week as we progressed in January. It seems like historically people talked about Super Bowl Sunday being the kickoff to the spring selling season. And we\u2019ve noticed the past few years that seems to be starting a little bit earlier. And maybe it\u2019s because the Cowboys did make the playoffs, people are buying houses sooner. So, we\u2019re excited for Chiefs. And I think\u2026 David Auld : And the 49ers Mike Murray : And yes -- speak on opportunity. David Auld : Yes. Jack Micenko : Just one more for me. A couple of jobs that you\u2019ve got, looks like you\u2019re trying to build a team on the single family rental side. Could you just refresh us on the strategy there and the thoughts, owned versus build for others, and how you\u2019re thinking about the business today? Mike Murray : Yes. We\u2019re currently think about the business, we\u2019re still early stages on it and we\u2019re trying to get in and really understand the operations of the business and see where we add the most value to that process. Today, it\u2019s probably more dipping our toe in the water on the owned side, but we are certainly looking at it hard, and have not shut the door on any possibility today. Operator : Our next question is coming from Ken Zener from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Ken Zener : So, you beat your closing guidance. I assume that was on higher intra-quarter order closings. Can you confirm that? And what was the percent for intra-quarter order closing in this 1Q versus last year? Jessica Hansen : You are correct that beat that. This quarter, it was 40% that we sold and closed in the same quarter, which is slightly higher than we would typically do. I don\u2019t know that I -- I do have last year. Last year, it was 37%. Ken Zener : Okay. And then, related to that, is there any shift in terms of -- I mean, that\u2019s what I would expect to see efficiency showing up. So, could you talk about if there is anything that you are thinking about in regards to that increase in that percent and talk about the margin spread that you -- or the trend that you guys have been seeing between the backlog closings and specifically the intra-quarter closing units? Jessica Hansen : On the first part, Ken, I would say, it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we would expect, especially with the number of completed specs that we have. That allows us the opportunity to sell and close more homes within the quarter. So, I would expect that trend to continue. Last year, in the second quarter, we actually sold and closed 45% homes in the same quarter, sold and closed. If you look at the margin differential, that stayed relatively consistent and that there is a slight differential and a slightly lower margin on specs than there is build jobs. That being said, really the only big differential is on our completed specs that have been completed and unsold for a period of multiple months. So, the earlier we sell it as a spec, the tighter that differential is. And as a reminder, about 80% of what we closed in a quarter started as spec. So, when you see that 21% home sales margin we reported this quarter, that\u2019s by and large is a spec gross margin. Ken Zener : Why is that spec margin a bit lower first backlog if there is a price appreciation? I mean, what is that -- I mean, what is that\u2019s moving? Is that you have to discount it, that seems inconsistent with order strength? Jessica Hansen : No. it\u2019s that we\u2019re underwriting to a return. And as we turn our spec housing more quickly than build jobs, we are able to work for a slightly lower gross margin and get an equivalent return. In the build job, you are actually going to lose the price appreciation, if you walk in before you start construction. And so, we like selling more in real time and capturing that margin as we move along the way. Mike Murray : Ken, a lot of our build job sales are actually sales of homes that we had planned to start anyway. They were in the production planning process to start. They just had not stated yet, but they were released to sale on the sales floor. Our average time in backlog for a customer that\u2019s in a build job is not terribly long because our homes -- generally, we are building through affordable price point, homes build fairly efficiently. And so, the customer is not sitting for a long period of time going through a large design selection process, lengthy permitting process till we get to start. A lot of these homes will be starting very soon after they sign the contract. So, it\u2019s a very tight margin differential between just a traditional spec sale to the marketplace. Ken Zener : I appreciate that. And if I could, one last question. Did you guys pull most of your permits in California to get ahead of the solar mandate? Thank you. David Auld : No. I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re responding to market out there. And certainly, the solar mandate is going to increase cost. But, pulling a permit and building a house when there is not a market forward is going to create a whole lot less return than pay any additional cost. So, it\u2019s kind of business as usual for us out there. And the solar mandate was -- we\u2019ve known about that for several years that we\u2019ve had the ability to prepare, and that\u2019s in our underwriting and we knew those costs were coming and as more and more homes are being built with solar, our base case expectation is that those costs will come down. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Quick question. Could you just put color on percentage of communities that you were able to raise price on, on a same plan basis? Mike Murray : Buck, we don\u2019t have that information in terms of tracking across our neighborhoods. We\u2019ve really have empowered our local operators to be looking to meet the market to drive returns, and that is certainly a function of pace and margin. And they\u2019re looking to maximize that at every community, every week, every day frankly as to looking at what that pace is. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019re managing centrally. So, we don\u2019t really have the ability to give you that color today. Jessica Hansen : When we talk about a lot, our revenues per square foot, that\u2019s a metric people -- we\u2019ve consistently reported and we have given that yet today. Year-over-year, our revenue per square foot was up about 3%, and our stick and brick costs were down about 0.5%. Sequentially, our revenues per square foot, and our stick and brick costs per square foot were essentially flat. Buck Horne : And switching over to just the multifamily investments. Just curious if you could provide any potential quarterly timing of expected sales or closings, or how do you think of potential gains on sale from the multifamily division, either this year, next year? How do you plan on growing that investment going forward? Mike Murray : Sure. In terms of timing, we expect to close a total of two projects in fiscal 2020. We closed our first one here in Q1. We did say that one of our communities is substantially complete, and so the process of stabilizing the rental situation and marketing it. So, we would expect to close that one later in fiscal 2020, don\u2019t have a specific quarter guide for you on that. And then, we do expect the investment level in the DHI Communities to grow this year. We expect it to grow approximately 100% from the point at the start of the year over the course of this year, as their pipeline is growing, and their number of projects will begin to grow more directly over the course of fiscal 2020, which will ultimately result in some future years, delivering more than two a year. The lead time, the pipeline on those deals is 2 to 3 years long. So, we\u2019re still a couple of years out from a significant increase of volume of project sales in DHI Communities. Operator : Thank you. Our next today is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Your line is now live. Jade Rahmani : Thank you. With respect to single-family rental and multifamily, do you have any interest as the company, and any interest in creating a permanent capital vehicle to hold those assets? In my experience, in the REIT sector, the highest valuation is ascribed to continual recurring earnings rather than gain on sale type earnings where it\u2019s unpredictable to the market? Just curious as to your thoughts on that? Bill Wheat : Yes. I understand that Jade. And it\u2019s something -- we\u2019re aware of that as well. And that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re studying as we as we get further into this business. Our goals early on have been to ensure that we have a strong, efficient operating platform for beginning with multifamily. And as we look at the single family rental space, we\u2019re looking to do the same thing there. And as we get that established, we then look to growing the platform and setting the capital base for it. And so, as we look at the medium and longer term plans for setting the capital base for both of those businesses, that\u2019s certainly something that we will be considering for the longer term. Jade Rahmani : Thanks very much. Turning to financial leverage, was wondering if the total debt to capital at slightly below 20% is in line with your long-term target, or do you think there\u2019s potentially improvement in that ratio in years to come? Bill Wheat : Where we are today, we don\u2019t expect to increase our leverage. We expect to -- as we are generating cash and adding to our equity base that our leverage would not increase from here, and we could see further decreases. Our stated maximum leverage is 35% or below. But obviously, we got a lot of headroom on that today, but that does give us room that in certain scenarios we would leave ourselves some room to invest further and increase leverage, but we don\u2019t see that in the short run. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Rohit Seth from SunTrust. Your line is now live. Rohit Seth : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with the Freedom brand? Any color on that buyer segment? David Auld : We continue to work on that product offering presentation and lifestyle. It\u2019s something we\u2019re happy with. I think, it will be a larger and larger portion of our deliveries in the future. It\u2019s a growing demographic. And we think we can provide a product and lifestyle that people are going to move into. Rohit Seth : Would you say -- are you expecting a ramp in that business in your annual guidance or is that annual guidance more driven by kind of that entry level bar? David Auld : It\u2019s still the entry level bar driving the market. The Freedom brand for us is part of our long term meet the needs of as many buyers out there as we can. And I think as the market moves, it will become a more and more important part of what we\u2019re doing. Rohit Seth : Understood. And then, second question on your gross margin guidance, 21%.Can you maybe break out the cost buckets there, what\u2019s your labor cost inflation expectation, material cost and then like cost. Jessica Hansen : Really just more of the same, so modest increases. I\u2019d say labor has stayed in the low single digit percentage range. Now that we\u2019ve kind of cycled through the lumber headwinds that we had, materials, we essentially would expect to be net neutral. We always have some categories where costs are going up. But, our purchasing teams do a fantastic job of finding other categories to lower our costs and offset whatever increases we\u2019re not able to push back on. And then, land really has been kind of a low to mid single digit percentage increase, at least on a per square foot basis. And that really is not expected to change either. I mean, land costs aren\u2019t coming down. As home prices, land costs typically follow. So, really just more of the same in \u201820 as what we experienced in \u201819, if you take out late calendar \u201818 incentive environment and the lumber costs that we cycled through. Rohit Seth : And what is the expectation for tariff -- the tariff impact or no impact, or what you have in there? Jessica Hansen : We\u2019ve got price protection on most everything. If there is a modest impact from any of the tariffs, we\u2019ve identified ways to offset that. Operator : Our next question is coming from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research. Your line is now live. Mark Weintraub : You mentioned the very positive early returns on spring selling season. Was that largely just a reference to strong orders in January, or was it other things that color that comment? Mike Murray : The primary thing is the order trends. I mean, that\u2019s the first read we\u2019re getting on what\u2019s coming through. And they\u2019re coming in at a great pace that we\u2019ve expected and we\u2019re seeing good seasonal build, week-to-week with that. And anecdotally, we\u2019re not hearing about any pushback or pressure on pricing from the customer side of the marketplace today. Mark Weintraub : Kind of following up on that. Obviously, as Jessica just mentioned, you have a fairly benign cost environment now. As things heat up, labor does go higher, materials go higher, et cetera, do you have a sense as to what type of pricing power you might have in the current environment? And really, I recognize it\u2019s always a question of taste versus price. But, I guess, at some point in time, when you try and push price, it could have a bigger impact than at other times. And certainly, we saw that in the last year or two. Do you think that we\u2019ve created a bit more cushion in the environment, so that there would be more leeway on price, if costs start to go up, or do you think we haven\u2019t exited that environment? Mike Murray : Feel really good about the market conditions we\u2019re seeing today and the buyers that are coming in and their urgency to buy. So, I would say we have some cushion to work with in that. But again, we\u2019re not just looking at a margin number, it is a return numbers, as you alluded to before, the pace versus price. And so, driving the communities at the planned absorptions, we found drive the highest returns. And then, the activity that begets that coming out of buyers seeing activity, seeing momentum, drives generally some pricing power and some margin expansion, executing at the community level. And that\u2019s really where our focus is. And as it\u2019s rolling up, we\u2019ve seen pretty consistent margins the last couple quarters and we\u2019re looking at that into next quarter. We\u2019re optimistic about spring, and that\u2019s going to tell us where margins ultimately go for this year. Mark Weintraub : And one last one. Where are your thoughts on offsite manufacturing as a way to potentially mitigate or improve the labor side of things in time? Mike Murray : So, we have -- a lot of our homes are put together with trusses, roof trusses that are manufactured offsite. Others, we\u2019re doing wall penalization in certain markets. And it\u2019s something we continually evaluate to look at the most efficient from both a time and a cost perspective as to how to deliver the home at the best value to the buyer. So, we\u2019re always evaluating it. We haven\u2019t seen a sea change in the economics of that today. Most of our homes are probably stick framed with trusses would be probably the broad generalization to say. But, there are some markets where we build roofs onsite. Mark Weintraub : Great. Thank you. Mike Murray : Vary across the country. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Your line is now live. Jay McCanless : Just two questions. On incentives, what are you guys doing with incentives now? And more importantly, what are you seeing from your competition? Bill Wheat : Pretty stable environment there. Certainly on a year-over-year basis, our incentives are down significantly, but over the last couple of quarters, been pretty stable. It\u2019s a normal environment where there\u2019s usually some level of incentives related to closing costs. And then, community-by-community, there could be some specific incentives but nothing out of the ordinary certainly in our business. And really, we\u2019re seeing pretty rational environment across other builders as well not hearing anything out of the ordinary. David Auld : I\u2019d say, the market is good. People are, as Bill said, performing rationally. It -- good time to be a homebuilder. Jay McCanless : My second question. Just talking about what your average lot per community is right now and are you expecting that the trend up just to get the higher year-over-year unit closures you talked about the guidance? Jessica Hansen : It slightly trended up here over the last couple of years, Jay, as our absorptions have improved, that does allow our underwriting to hit our standards and use slightly larger communities. So, I would say that is incorporated in what we\u2019re expecting for fiscal \u201820, but that\u2019s really just been more of the same of what we\u2019ve experienced each of the last few years. Multiple product types and larger communities allows us to drive more absorption. So, I don\u2019t have our current average lot size or a lot count. Rough, I would say probably 150, 200 lots. But obviously, we\u2019ve got significant variation in that. We\u2019ve got communities that are 30 lots, we\u2019ve got a communities are a 1,000 lots. Mike Murray : Some more options, some more owned. There\u2019s a big mix there. Operator : Our next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Your line is now live. Alex Barron : I guess, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to the guidance. Over the last two quarters, orders have been double digit and a little bit off of that was maybe easier comp. But, I guess, I\u2019m just curious, you guys just being conservative this early in the spring selling season basically, giving the single digit order growth guidance or delivery guidance? Jessica Hansen : So, Alex, not to be repetitive, but really, it is a function of where we sit today, the number of houses we have, the number of houses we had going into the year. We did have a much easier comp this quarter compared to late calendar last year, when the market was completely different than what it is. And to remind everyone, we heavily incentivized into December and really ended the spring to continue those sales increases that we saw. I think, we were the only builder in calendar 4Q of \u201818 that had an up quarter. Our sales were up about 3%, and that really was just a function of how heavily we incentivized in December to get there. So, October and November, you can read into were very tough months. And that led into a good comp this year, and 19% you though. I mean, it\u2019s a good market. As Mike\u2019s alluded to several times, we feel very good about the market today. But, we sit here today, we haven\u2019t seen the spring selling season. We\u2019ve got 5% fewer houses in the ground. So, if we\u2019re able to push and get a few more starts in, and the spring is stronger than expected, could there be a little upside, potentially, but we don\u2019t see a whole lot. And we did already raise the higher end of our guidance by about 500 homes. Mike Murray : And on balance, we\u2019re looking at much stronger returns in fiscal 2020, because we\u2019re still seeing a good pace. Even at the guidance level, we\u2019re seeing a good pace, at better margins, better returns and a better turn of our inventory this year as well. So, we\u2019re very pleased with our positioning with the good market backdrop, and with our plan for the year. Alex Barron : Got it. And then, you mentioned that the best returns come from maintaining the sales pace pretty strong. So, we [indiscernible] you are seeking to push prices so much to not upset that strong sales pace? Jessica Hansen : It depends on the community, Alex. It really just depends. If we\u2019ve got another community replacing a community ready to go behind it, we\u2019re going to most likely push more pace than we are priced because that\u2019s the best thing that we can do is continue to turn our inventory, generate more revenue and profits in a shorter period of time. But, if it\u2019s an area of the country where we don\u2019t have a replacement community or for whatever reason that community is not replaceable, we are going to be more likely to push price. So, it\u2019s always a balance community-by-community. Alex Barron : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks and good luck this year. Mike Murray : Thank you, Alex. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to David for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in April. And to the D.R. Horton team, outstanding first quarter. Thank you for your focus and hard work, and we\u2019ve got a great year set up, let\u2019s go deliver it. Operator : So, thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank You, Jessica and good morning. Although, we are in different locations while practicing social distancing, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to first express our gratitude to our country's dedicated field of healthcare workers and all who are on the front lines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and before we talk about our second quarter results, I will address current market conditions while we along with the rest of the world navigate through the impacts of Covid-19 on the economy and our business operations. Housing market and economic fundamentals were solid throughout most of the second quarter as interest rates on mortgage loans remained low, new home demand was strong and there was a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across most of our markets. However, during the latter part of March and into April the impacts of Covid-19 and related widespread reduction in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business operations, as well as the demand for new homes across all of our markets. We experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in sales orders in late March in to date in April as compared to the same period last year. In almost all municipalities across the US where social distancing and other restrictions have been implemented, residential construction, lot development, financial services have been designated as essential businesses as part of critical infrastructure. We have continued our operations in those markets were allowed and it made appropriate adjustments to comply with social distancing and other standards as the health safety of our employees, customers and trade partners is our number one priority. We believe we are well prepared to operate in this uncertain environment. With our experienced operating teams, low leverage and a strong liquidity position. We plan to maintain our flexible operations and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, limiting land acquisition and land development spending and adjusting our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales space and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of the communities based on local housing market conditions. Our team delivered a strong second quarter during this unprecedented time for our nation and while making significant adjustments to our operational practices in March. Our consolidated pretax income for the quarter increased 34% to $621 million on 9% increase in revenues to $4.5 billion. Our pretax profit margin improved 260 basis points to 13.8% and our net sales orders increased 40%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31st was 20.2% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.1%. Mike? Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 40% to $1.30 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 37% to $483 million compared to $351 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed, up from $4 billion on 13,480 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from last year to $3,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 20% to 20,087 and the value of those orders was $6 billion, up 22% from $4.9 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $299,700, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 19% flat with the same quarter last year. As we disclosed in our preliminary release, our March net sales orders increased 6% from last year to 6,491 homes and our cancellation rate for the month was 24%. As a result of the pandemic, our sales orders began to decrease in late March and into April and our cancellations have remained elevated throughout April to date. Although April is not quite over yet, our net sales orders month-to-date is approximately 11% lower than the same period a year ago. This month-to-date net sales trend may not be indicative of the full month of April because a significant number of our sales cancellations typically occur in the final days of each month. However, we have seen an increase in our net sales order volumes in the most recent two weeks compared to the preceding four weeks. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 21.3%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the December quarter, up 200 basis points compared to the prior year. And in line with our expectations. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities during this uncertain environment to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. If economic conditions remain difficult and the recent decline in new home demand persists, we expect that our gross margins will decline from current levels. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, down 70 basis points from 9% in the prior year quarter. 55 basis points of the reduction in SG&A this quarter related to a decrease in the liability for our employee deferred compensation plan resulting from the decline in the stock market during the quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the second quarter with 33,400 homes in inventory, 16,700 of our total homes were unsold of which 4,700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. We are cautiously managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our communities by controlling our construction starts of unsold homes and closely monitoring the number of unsold completed homes and inventory. At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 330,000 lots of which 36% were owned and 64% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. David? David Auld : Our second quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1 billion of which $460 million was for finish lots; $350 million was for land development and $230 million was for land. Beginning in late March, we have temporarily stopped our purchase of raw land and we are closely managing all finished lot purchases and development spending. We are also working closely with our third party lot developers including Forestar to adjust the timing of our takedown schedules to match current demand levels. Mike? Mike Murray : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 50 markets across 21 states. At March 31st, Forestar's lot position consisted of 52,300 lots, of which 35,800 are owned and 16,500 are controlled through purchase contracts, 80% of Forestar's own lots are already under contract with D R Horton were subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D R Horton and has approximately $790 million of liquidity, which includes $440 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. During the quarter, Forestar are issued $300 million of 5% senior notes due 2028 and repaid $119 million of 3.75% convertible senior notes in cash at maturity. At March 31st, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 19.5% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D R Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate to these uncertain economic conditions. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the second quarter was $24.7 million with a pretax profit margin of 23.6% compared to $34 million and 33.5% in the prior year quarter. In late March and April, our mortgage company experienced lower pricing and gains on sales of mortgage loans and servicing rights due to disruption in the secondary mortgage markets. Many purchasers and servicers have limited their purchases and tighten their credit standards due to liquidity and operational challenges caused by Covid-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of forbearance provisions from the Cares Act. We are closely monitoring developments in the mortgage markets and are prepared to make adjustments in our operations to adapt to further changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies' loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 67% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 48% of the mortgage companies' volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time homebuyers represented 53% of the closings handled by our mortgage company reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points. David? David Auld : The DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments with operations primarily in Texas, Arizona and Florida. During the quarter, DHI Communities sold an apartment project in Florida for $67 million and recorded a gain on sale of $28.2 million. This was DHI Communities fourth project sales and it was a final sale we were expecting this year. DHI Communities has three projects under active construction and one project that were substantially complete at the end of the quarter. We are continuing lease up and construction of these four projects but are delaying new acquisitions and deferring starting construction on other projects until we have clear visibility into market conditions. DHI Communities assets total $203 million at March 31st. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest in capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the first six months of fiscal 2020, our cash provided by our homebuilding operations was $52 million compared to $216 million of cash used in the prior year period. In March 31st, we had $2 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage improved 370 basis points to 19.2%, a balance of our homebuilding public notes outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.9 billion and we have $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12-months. At March 31st, our stockholders equity was $10.5 billion and book value per share was $28.77, up 15% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-month period ended March 31st, our return on equity was 19.1% compared to 17.6% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends, $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We also repurchase 4 million shares of common stock for $197 million. Our outstanding share count was down 3% year-over-year. We plan to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and are expected and operating results. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we mentioned in our press release, we have withdrawn our previously issued fiscal 2020 guidance due to the current uncertainty in the US economy and our business operations resulting from Covid-19. We expect to provide new annual guidance when we have clearer visibility into our business and market conditions. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the efforts of our dedicated operational teams who continued to provide homes to families across the United States. We are well-positioned to effectively operate in this uncertain environment with our experienced team, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to withstand difficult economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D R Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts and positive caring spirit during this unprecedented time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and creativity and finding ways to safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed. JohnLovallo: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my call and hope everyone is doing well. First question is, can you just help frame the magnitude of the improvement or an order activity over the past two weeks, maybe on a year-over-year basis. I mean are we talking about kind of down mid single digits? Is it closer to flat year-over-year? Any color would be helpful? BillWheat: Hey, John. This is this is Bill. We're not commenting on specific weeks, from week to week sales, gross sales can activity net sales can be quite volatile. So we provided our commentary on a month to day basis because we feel like that the most representative information that we can provide. We did indicate that our translation level has remained elevated into April, which obviously affects net sales as well. JohnLovallo: Okay. I understand. And then maybe just in terms of the order decline in April. Were there any particular regions that stood out? Maybe on a positive or on a negative basis and then in the regions that are starting to open up in some of these states, are you guys doing anything different in preparation there? MikeMurray: Good morning, John. This is Mike. We've seen probably Texas and Florida hold up pretty well, but I would say every market is down and down fairly consistently outside of Texas and Florida. It's been a pretty broad-based impact. JohnLovallo: Got it. And then are you guys doing anything different in some of the states that are planning to open early? JessicaHansen: Well, fortunately and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, residential construction has been designated in essential business as part of critical infrastructure. So we really haven't been heavily impacted in terms of shutdowns. The biggest place we would have been impacted is Seattle since the state of Washington did not consider residential construction as part of an essential business. The state of Washington was about 3% of our closings in calendar 2019. And in the other areas that have been shut down for construction has been the bay area, New Jersey and Pennsylvania and when you combine those with the state of Washington, we're still only around 4% of our closings last year. So really the biggest impact has more been on just the ability to interact with consumers face to face, as we want to make sure we comply with social distancing protocol. So majority of our offices, our sales offices are by appointment only. Our trades are limited to one trade per job site at a time among numerous other new operational protocols we put in place, which has slowed our build cycles and impacted the business but by and large the true shutdowns has happened mainly in markets where we don't operate heavily. Operator : Our next question is from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed. CarlReichardt: Thanks very much. Hope everyone is safe and well. My first question is on pricing and incentives and maybe you could talk generally, Dave or whoever like to about generally how you're looking at pricing and incentives now where you've adjusted what kinds of prices incentive adjusted you made and how consumers are responding to them? DavidAuld: Carl, this is David. We are responding I guess community by community. We kind of reset expectations on absorption. We rerun pace again kind of gets old saying but it's to me it's a flag by flag operation. You've got to maintain a certain level of pace and we adjust the incentives to maintain that pace. So the reality is Texas, Florida, if held up better given all the constraints and really after the shock of the first couple of weeks our people out there, if it kind of got a rhythm and figured out how to sell houses and all in from my perspective things are better than I had expect and than I was concerned they might be so. CarlReichardt: Thanks David. Then as a follow-up can you talk a little bit about construction cycle times and if your supply chain is struggled at all from the labor whole perspective? We've heard mixed things about labor availability obviously social distancing making it harder to get houses up and then of course inspection delays things like that maybe what percentage have your cycle times increased, if they have in terms of sort of start to see about. Thanks a lot. MikeMurray: Thanks Carl. This is Mike. We haven't really seen a lot of the cycle time changes coming through in the data yet because these are fairly recent operational changes that we've made in the field, both ourselves and a lot of our governing municipalities with the cadence of inspections. So we'll let you know as we see those trends develop through the quarter. What they actually work out to be. I have been very impressed with our teams and their ability to keep each other safe and respond to demand for housing and be out there building with labor. We see a lot of our labor on site wants to work. We've not had a seeing lots of labor shortages at all. Or not been able to travel like I normally have. So I haven't seen as much coming into this call than would have been prior calls, but driving the Dallas-Fort worth markets, I've seen a lot of activity. The trades, a lot of signage around in our neighborhoods and other neighborhoods about maintaining social distancing and seeing a lot of our labor activity being executed with people not heavily congregating in the streets or on the job sites. So I've been very pleased with that and very pleased with the pace that we've been able to maintain in our communities. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed. StephenKim: Yes. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate all the information and likewise hope you guys are staying safe. David, I wanted to follow up on the comment you made about how the tone of business thus far has been a little bit better than you would have initially feared they might be. And your indication that orders improved in the last two weeks prior to the previous or relative to the prior four weeks. Is it fair to say that in your -- what you have observed is that this increase was not driven by pricing actions but by something else? And if the latter, what do you think that surprising strength was related to? DavidAuld: Yes. Stephen, I like everybody else was a news junkie coming when this thing first broke and you turn on the President's briefing and the world's going to end. And so you kind of get hunkered down mentality and as news has come out more and more and more it just you get a sense that it's not going to be as bad as the initial thought might have been. And the key, I guess, to me there's two things that really separate us from everybody else. It's the people we have out there representing the brand and then it's just the price point. And the people want to be in the house right now and by being affordable we have more opportunities put them in a house than our competitors. So that to me is probably the mood of the country seems to have improved significantly over the last 30 days and our ability to kind of manage the process through systems and communications. And just being more comfortable. I think has given us a lot, an opportunity to make things happen. So this is unprecedented times. StephenKim: No doubt. And but it's certainly encouraging that what you're seeing in even in advance of many parts of almost any part of the country really opening up which I guess began this past weekend. My second question relates to cancellations in sort of tempering your commentary on the orders improving. You mention the cancellations tend to be clustered in the last few days of a month. I was curious if you give us a sense for roughly how much of the cancellation activity occurs in those last few days? Are we talking like three-quarters of your monthly cancellations occurred? Are we talking more like 25% just dimensionalize that for us a little bit and in general are those cancellations that you have been seeing, the degree to which you have been seeing them already, are they tied to mortgage credit standards tightening or is it tied to something else as far as you can tell? DavidAuld: I think it's just timing when everybody wants to, our sales agents want to see people closed. The buyers want to close. You push through on the credit to get to a closing point and but majority in this industry of the -- that the majority of people closed the last week of the month. And when you're bringing everything to the point of closing, things fall out and whether it's a cancellation or a push to the next month that tends to happen now the percentage, I don't have any idea. But I mean we have been very purposeful in making sure that viruses in our backlog are going to be in a position to close. So historically that number may be 15% -20% the last week. I don't know maybe a little more. That's just not anything I track. It just, go ahead, Jessica, sorry. JessicaHansen: And clearly right now it's always true that more happen at the end of the quarter, but we're anticipating there could be even more right now due to the current uncertainty in the market. Typically the main reason people cancel is because they can't ultimately qualify for the mortgage. So are we going to have some fallout because of tightening credit standard, potentially, I think the bigger driver right now is just job loss and loss of income certainty and so there are a lot of buyers that are canceling because of some sort of impact of Covid-19 that's out of their control. And so I think that's the main driver for us putting that cautionary language in there. There are still a few more days in April and we just don't know. BillWheat: This is phenomenon we do see every month and we saw it at the end of March/ MikeMurray: We did see at the end of March. BillWheat: There was definitely a higher level of cancs around the last days of the month of March. MikeMurray: And David touched on the before is that most homebuyers are trying to schedule their home closing towards the end of the calendar month because of the way they're prepaid and the escrows are funded. It reduces their out-of-pocket cash requirement and so they're the outside realtors often advice that. So we see more of our closings in a given month scheduled trying to be scheduled by the buyers and their realtors for the last week of the month. So as you bring those things together at the end of the month that's when you find out you might have had an outside lender who could not get mortgage taken care of or something happens it just a lot pushes all the once. And so that's why we added the language to the press release into our commentary this morning. StephenKim: Yes. That's encouraging. That's very helpful. I mean I supposed it is encouraging that the credit standards have already tightened and hopefully it will tighten a whole lot more from here which would but obviously help. But that's a very great color. I appreciate it and good luck with the rest of the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. Please proceed. AlanRatner: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for all the info; glad to hear everyone's doing okay and congrats on the strong performance so far in this difficult environment. My first question, historically, specs have accounted for, I think, about 70% to 80% of your sales and just in terms of that level of homes that started as a spec home. And you might have sold it at various points of the construction. So I guess I'm a little bit curious how your spec starts have been trending? First, I guess, is there any reason to think that that percentage might move lower here just given some change in strategy that you guys might be imparting on? But the question is like how much are your starts down year-over-year for April because that I guess in my mind should be a fairly good leading indicator of what future order activity might look like? MikeMurray: Alan, we don't have the April starts month to day number here with us. Now we'll -- we can probably follow up with you on that or certainly by the end of the quarter, we'll be putting that information out for the starts. But we're managing our spec strategy the same way we always have. It's at a community by community level, measuring demand in that community and looking at what inventory is available today. The construction status of that inventory and seeing what needs to be available for those buyers in that given community. So that's a very local decision that our teams are making on it, on a daily and weekly basis. It's nothing; we're anticipating changing at this point in time. We are obviously looking at what we would call a build job making sure that that buyer is still committed to the home before we start the house. If there's anything unusual with that house that it wouldn't otherwise be acceptable as a spec, if something happened to that by our contract we'd be happy to have that home in inventory to sell to another buyer, if need be. That happens from time to time as well. JessicaHansen: We would anticipate that 70% to 80% that you reference not changing. MikeMurray: Right. JessicaHansen: What we have done is slower starts pace to match the reduction in current demand levels. And we'll continue to make those adjustments community by community. AlanRatner: Got it. Yes. That's what I was trying to get at is if that slowing of the starts, it's tracking call it's somewhere down 10% to 15% kind of what you're experiencing and the orders are for some reason it's coming in lower than that, but you can follow up with me on that if you don't have the data handy. Second question, if I could just on the mortgage data you guys provided, I'm curious if you have any additional granularity there. We've heard some tightening specifically on FHA, VA which is back half of your business below certain FICO scores whether that's 640, 660, I'm not sure if there's a magic cutoff from the investors you are dealing with. But do you have the percentage of your business that falls below say a 660 FICO score and does the piece of your business that your mortgage company does not capture the 30% plus. Does that profile look any different? JessicaHansen: So I don't have insight to the outside mortgage company, but when you look at our inside mortgage company, we've been running about a 720 FICO score on average and even our express buyers been around 700 to 710. So do we have some buyers that fall in the band you're talking about? Sure. But it's not a large piece and typically our mortgage company does a fantastic job of when those credit overlays and changes in terms of FICO scores happen, working to figure out a different mortgage product to get that buyer into. So it's not generally a 100% fall out although there can be some fallout. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please proceed. MichaelRehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congrats on the results so far and also hope everyone's safe across the D R Horton organization. The first question I had was trying to look at or think about the April results from a different angle. Obviously, very encouraging in terms of the down 11% even with perhaps even a higher cancs rate in the last few days expected. When you think about that relative to your competitor reporting last week in terms of a sharper fall-off in April and other companies talking about even more challenging March quarter. So I'm trying to get a sense I was wondering if you could comment around how you guys are operating or perhaps how you're positioned that has allowed for the better results versus several of your peers. Be it price point or you had also mentioned that if the current demand level persists you need expect gross margins to contract. So I'm curious if the relative out performance versus some of your peers and some of the stats is driven by existing again price point or geographic exposure or if you have made some more aggressive adjustments in your pricing or incentives. That's my first question. MikeMurray: Thanks Michael. Completely appreciate the question and I will say that I am most impressed with David mentioned for the teams of people we have out there that are operating; that are empowered to make decisions at the local level. And they're generally operating a business model that has inventory on the ground. It has specs, quick move in homes that are available and we're seeing a buyer come to us that may have been looking for an existing home and that's a very challenging transaction to make happen today. And so we're seeing some benefit of that and working with our realtor relationships able to execute against that and bring those buyers to a new home situation, where we have inventory on the shelf ready to go. As David mentioned before, we generally position to be an affordable option for the buyers in the market.  And finally, we're very encouraged by the level of activity we've seen the more recent weeks in April and that there are people out there that want a home and are able to qualify to get in contract for this home. And bring enthusiasm as we see and watching our social media as those buyers are super excited about the home they're able to acquire at this point in time. JessicaHansen: In terms of incentives which I think was the other piece your question. We have started utilizing just the typical incentives we would in a period of market weakness. So generally that will include higher co broke commissions and more dollars towards closing costs, if you use our internal mortgage company. And then just the array of ploys that our marketers come up with in terms of free fridge Friday, throwing in backyard landscaping, a lot of different things they can just repackage from week to week to where it's not necessarily a bigger hit to gross margin down the road, but it drives by our urgency to get a different incentive out there from week to week or month to month. So we have started to utilize slightly higher level of incentives because of the market weakness, but that's what we would typically do in this kind of environment. MikeMurray: And oftentimes that's very helpful to energize and motivate our internal sales agents in their activity, in their outreach program. So that's one of the reasons we would generally do activities like that. MichaelRehaut: No, that's helpful. And again clearly your relative performance is impressive either way you look at it. So congrats on that. I guess the second question also perhaps along these lines but from a different angle is Forestar as you had alluded to their results in your prepared remarks, they reported last week one interesting data point that they had was roughly only about 150 lot deliveries in the month of April or so far in April versus a rate of 650 to 700 in the February, March months. And so obviously that kind of points to a much sharper fall-off similar, more similar perhaps to some of the other competitors that I alluded to before in terms of the fall-off in order pace that they had been seeing. So I was just kind of curious, I was hoping perhaps you can reconcile how your April results have held up much better than that obviously is D R Horton is the major overwhelming customer of Forestar. If they are, if you guys aren't seeing as that type of a degree of magnitude of fall off, why has the Forestar lot deliveries falling so much more dramatically? BillWheat: Sure, Michael. This is Bill. It's really a matter of timing and as Forestar pointed out on their call, they're working with each of their builder customers obviously we are the majority of their deliveries right now. And it's a matter of sitting down community by community looking at the inventory levels of lots that the builder currently has looking at the revised expectations of pace and then determining the timing of what takedowns need to be adjusted to. And so for the first few weeks post the change of the market conditions, it's really a matter of, I think, everyone hits the pause button for just a short period of time to reassess. And so pushing out takedown will most affect the first month. And I think that's where Forestar is but as we work through our adjustments we would expect that their takedowns would become more steady going forward. And it's going to be community by community really as we work our way through this. So there is a timing difference on lot purchases relative to home sales, but ultimately to the extent that we're delivering, we're purchasing most of their lots ultimately Forestar space will ultimately match or start to approximate Horton after a period of time. MichaelRehaut: Well any of those adjustment and delays related to a change in strike price for those lots or is it more primarily driven within a degree around timing of the takedowns? BillWheat: It's primarily timing. That's the initial adjustment is to adjust to the pace community by community. So it's a vast majority of adjustments are all in timing. Operator : Our next question is from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. TrumanPatterson: Hi. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for taking my questions. I'm glad to hear you all are safe and healthy. First on SG&A, you had a very good number this quarter, great control. Could you just run through the drivers of this? And then also looking forward how are you all planning to adjust headcount going forward or whether or not you are planning on adjusting any headcount? JessicaHansen: And so as Bill indicated on the call that the main driver of our year-over-year improvement and our SG&A was down 70 basis points, 55 basis points of that was due to a decrease in the liability for our deferred comp plans for our employees resulting from the significant declines in the stock market this quarter. They're really only 15 basis points of their improvement was true leverage from the improved volumes we've seen in the market. And then I think Mike and Bill are going to chime in on your other question. MikeMurray: On the headcount, Truman, I would say that we are continually looking for ways to be as efficient as possible in the business. Right now, we don't have any broad-based layoffs or account adjustment plans. We're responding to what we see in demand in the marketplace. And we will continue to do that market by market. Our most important asset is the teams, the people that we have out there in the field and we've been a lot of work over the past 12 -15 years positioning the company to be prepared for whatever economic situation that we're forced to navigate through. And our people are the most important part of helping us get through all this. JessicaHansen: We have in the near term instituted a hiring freeze just during the current market uncertainty. BillWheat: Truman, I'd as you well know, we're a very overhead conscious company. And we're at actually the lowest point in our history in terms of SG&A as a percentage of our revenues. And so clearly we know how to manage our overhead relative to revenues and as we see where things go on a local basis moving forward, you can count on this to manage it well. TrumanPatterson: Okay. And then just jumping over to capital allocation. You guys have a $1 billion in cash, $2 billion in liquidity. Assuming that the market just stays down and that we will call it 10% to 15% range moving forward. Do you think you'd be able to restart the share repurchase in relatively short order? And then also jumping over to the MA environment, I realize that's probably too soon but have you seen any increase in potential deal flow or any kind of distressed builders out on the market? BillWheat: So I'll start with the share repurchase question, Truman. As we stated, we are cautiously managing that. It's too early to say exactly when or how we might be able to address that going forward. Base case, we would not expect to repurchase any shares in our third quarter as we assess market conditions and we see how things progress. But we do expect to maintain a balanced capital allocation over the long term. And we are focused on investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, maintaining a flexible position and still delivering strong returns to our shareholders. MikeMurray: And then, Truman, to the comment on MA, I do believe it is still a bit early in a situation to see any opportunities that make present as a result of the most recent market change. But we continue to evaluate opportunities generally with smaller private builders that are complementary to our platform in various markets or product offerings. So we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as they present. It's nice to have the capital to make those decisions to invest in a business. DavidAuld: And I'd just that even though we're very happy with what we're seeing today, these are uncertain times and nobody really knows what the ultimate impact of all this is going to be. And being in a very liquid deleveraged, de-risk position, I think will afford a lot of opportunity for, in the event, there is distressed situation out there down the road. So we're looking at liquidity, de-leverage has a very strong competitive advantage for us today. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed. MatthewBouley: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Hope everyone's well. Thanks for all the detail. So I wanted to ask on the construction labor side and maybe thinking a little more medium-term. I think there's sort of a debate out there around perhaps increasing availability of labour that could emerge in the coming months as the industry volumes come down and perhaps there's a wider pool of labour just given the unemployment situation we've seen across the market. What do you guys hearing on that front? Are you seeing the subs perhaps trying to attract additional labor here? Just how are you thinking about whether that labour tightness we've seen over these past few years will continue? Thank you. MikeMurray: Matthew, as you mentioned if there's a reduction in the activity level of the industry broadly that would create more labour available for the remaining starts that are out there. And then, obviously, if unemployment levels say at elevated rates that would create the opportunity to attract more people to the construction trades, if they are as the builders are starting homes. So we've seen adequate supply of labour along largely from our long relationships and large market positions. We've not been heavily constrained with our labour and I expect that going forward, we'll continue to build a partner with those people and perhaps with additional labour available to us in a given market, we can create some other efficiency for us. MatthewBouley: Okay. Understood. And then I want to follow up on the orders month to date, the down 11%. Any sense of how that shakes out by buyer group? I guess specifically what you're seeing with the entry-level buyer through all this? JessicaHansen: It's really been across the board in terms of reductions in demand. So a little too early for us to parse exactly if there's one buyer type that ultimately is going to be hit harder by the overall impact of what the whole world's going through right now. And right now it has just been broad-based and declines in demand across all price points and buyers. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. SusanMaklari: Thank you. Good morning. My first question is just can you talk a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of input costs? Have you seen any deflation maybe coming through? Or how are you thinking about that as you looks over the next few quarters? MikeMurray: I think teams did a really good job of keeping control of the input cost for materials especially we've seen our stick and brick cost per square foot basically in flat as a percentage of revenue sequentially and year-over-year this quarter. And so with that we've been really good. We've got national agreements in place with a significant portion of our manufactured materials that have been able to give us very strong pricing in the marketplace, but we've not seen any significant deflationary effects come through yet. SusanMaklari: Okay. Thanks. And then looking a little bit further out, perhaps thinking about what's going on the ground, do you expect that there could be a shift or a material shift in your buyer segment and the breakout of the business? And what could that potentially mean as we think about maybe the margins and some of the trajectory on that going forward? JessicaHansen: Hi. We're just going to continue to focus on homes at affordable price points, so that doesn't necessarily only mean entry-level buyers. We want to make sure we have an affordable or at least value-priced product offering across our entire family of brands. I think a core piece of our business will always remain the entry-level first-time buyer because there's just such a big population and clearly the more affordable you can be that the bigger that pool is of potential buyers. And so really the focus for us isn't necessarily a specific demographic or buyer type it's just being affordable across multiple price points and product offerings, Operator : Our next question is from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. MikeDahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question just on the lending side. I think, David, you mentioned kind of purposefully managing the backlog with respect to just getting visibility on ability to close but at the same time everyone's pushing and invested in taking it as far along and as close to the finish line as possible. And I think, Jessica, you mentioned that job loss or income uncertainty has been the main driver of cancellation so far, but when we think about the three buckets of kind of broad issues, you've got job loss; you've got income loss or DTI issues and then you've got the other credit standards maybe you'd bucket those slightly differently, but when you think across those what percentage of your backlog have you been able to actively verify all three of those buckets or all necessary closing conditions at this point. BillWheat: HI, Mike. This is Bill. Probably not have specific percentages on that. We do turn our backlog rather quickly. Our backlog conversion rate is over 100% this quarter. So we do see fairly quickly with our spec strategy. We're selling homes during the construction process. We're getting to a scheduled closing date probably relatively quickly. And so we're essentially six weeks into this change, significant change in market conditions. We believe we've probably worked through a very good portion of the backlog. And as we work past the end of the month of April, I think, there's another step in that process, but we'll see really an appreciable move in terms of scrubbing the backlog after we really get past the month of April. I would say largely we will have a pretty good feel for where we stand with our backlog because a lot of our contracts, union backlog at that point will have been entered more recently not a 100%, but more recently and buyers who are signing new contracts after the beginning of the pandemic are probably looking at things a little differently than those that were in backlog prior to. MikeDahl: Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up questions still on the lending side. When we look at mortgage loans held for sale, those are up over 70% year-on-year on the balance sheet and clearly revenues are only running up 10% for the quarter or potentially lower going forward. So can you explain that differential or are you effectively underwriting more risk or balance sheeting more risk in order to get loans done today or what else explains that move? BillWheat: No change in those factors, Mike. Our volume increase on the homebuilding side is one factor. Also our mortgage company is now capturing, their capture rate of mortgages in the builder business has increased significantly over the last year or so. And so that -- so the mortgage loan held for sale, the mortgage origination volume by our mortgage company is a much stronger than actually our homebuilding revenues. MikeMurray: Yes. At this point in April we've effectively sold all of our March loan origination from the mortgage company. So no change there, servicing and loans. JessicaHansen: So the data point on the capture rate and today their capture rate for the second quarter was 67%. I think that might be the highest quarterly capture rate we've reported for the mortgage company. They've been actively working to capture more of the builder business and so that's been purposeful and that compares to only a 56% capture rate last year at this time. MikeDahl: Okay. Got it. So to be clear, I guess, you are not underwriting any loans at this point that would not be eligible or from a practical standpoint can be sold into the secondary market with current standards? JessicaHansen: Correct. We're continuing to underwrite and virtually everything is agency eligible. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed. KenZener: Good morning, everybody. So, Jessica, can you guys talk about how many of your orders in 2Q were inter quarter closings? And if that shifted and if you have it for April that would be great, but if you saw something shift in March first that overall quarterly rate. JessicaHansen: I don't have it for the quarter or for, I don't have it from March or April specifically, Ken, but for the quarter, we sold and closed 48% of our homes in the same quarter, which was up from 40% sequentially and up from 45% year-over-year. So we did have a very strong backlog conversion rate which is why you would anticipate that two of them more sold and closed in the same quarter this year than last year at this time. KenZener: Yes. So the reason I asked that question is and the trend seems to be that you closed more based on what you just said. Therefore your pre build approach which obviously helped to turn your assets faster also allows you to compete with the existing market. So my question is with your 33,400 units under construction being that you're in 2Q, done with 2Q, historically you closed about 95% and give or take a couple points of your under construction over the next six months. Therefore, it seems and your comments don't seem to be that closing is the issue. You haven't really talked about a lot of construction delays though, Michael. So it seems like, I understand you pulled guidance. So -- are you -- would your concern more be about margins or I mean you have your units that are construction, so is it just, David, is it just that the demand might disappear or I mean is it just that it's so wise to not offer guidance and potentially miss it. Because I mean you have these units under construction. It seems your closing units you finish, so where's the real volatility I think in your normal cadence of closings, disappearing versus margins versus demand fading. DavidAuld: How would you say that this has been unprecedented event taking place? And we're managing through the process and responding to what we see so far. I would say it has been a better environment because of I think primarily because the way we are positioned with inventory and with the very creative and energized sales force out there. And as we get more clarity, I think, we will probably share that with you, but it's just an unprecedented time. KenZener: Yes. No. Idea makes sense. It's just that it seems though your closings won't be off that much given you already have these units under construction and you're still closing a lot of units. And if your pre build model it helps so. Totally understand. Thank you very much for your time/ End of Q& A Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to David for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you. Sherry. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again in July. And to the D R Horton team, stay safe, stay strong. You are proving once again you are the best in the industry. D R Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for all you do every day. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President, Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica, please go ahead. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Kevin and good morning.

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to be joined \u2013 to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We would like to first again express our gratitude to our country\u2019s dedicated field of healthcare workers and to all who are on the frontlines caring for our communities. Our thoughts remain with those affected by this pandemic and our priority continues to be the health and safety of our employees, customers, trade partners and the communities we serve. During the latter part of March, the impacts of COVID-19 and related widespread reductions in economic activity across the United States began to negatively affect our business. During April, when restrictive stay-at-home orders were in place for most of our markets, our sales orders decreased and our cancellations increased and our April net sales orders were 1% lower than a year ago. However, as restrictive orders began to be lifted across many markets and economic activity resumed, our sales increased significantly and our cancellations rate returned to normal levels. In both May and June, our net sales orders increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods, resulting in a net sales order increase of 38% for the quarter. We sold 5,931 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, positioning D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale. We have continued to see strong increases in net sales orders in July compared to the same month last year. Despite the disruption from COVID-19 on our operations, the D.R. Horton team delivered a record third quarter, including net sales orders of 21,519 homes, a 25% increase in consolidated pre-tax income to $782 million and a 10% increase in revenues to $5.4 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin for the quarter improved 170 basis points to 14.5%, while our EPS increased 37% to $1.72 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 21.6% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 19.9%. While housing market conditions are very strong today, we remain cautious as to the impact that COVID-19 may have on the overall economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity position and experienced operating teams, position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible, operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. Mike? Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 37% to $1.72 per share compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 33% to $631 million compared to $475 million. The current quarter results, included income tax benefit of $38.1 million related to federal energy efficient home tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 10% to $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed, up from $4.7 billion on 15,971 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was essentially flat with last year at $295,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 3% reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the third quarter increased 38% to 21,519 homes and the value of those orders was $6.3 billion, up 35% from $4.7 billion in the prior year. Our average number of active selling communities was essentially unchanged from both the prior year and sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $294,500, down 2% from the prior year, primarily due to a decline in the average sales price for our West region as more of the region\u2019s mix shifted to our entry level Express brand during the quarter. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 22%, up from 20% in the prior year quarter. Our net sales orders in both May and June increased by more than 50% compared to the prior year periods. We believe the increase in demand after April has been fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, the limited supply of homes at affordable price points, and to some extent, pent-up demand. We were and remain well-positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lots supply and housing inventories, particularly completed homes and those close to completion. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 21.6%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the March quarter and up 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter. However, there is uncertainty regarding the future impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and new home demand, which could negatively impact our gross margins in the future. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, was 7.9%, down 20 basis points from 8.1% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the third quarter with 32,800 homes in inventory. 12,700 of our total homes were unsold, of which 2,900 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our significant increase in sales in May and June, the portion of our backlog that is not yet under construction is higher than normal and our number of completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. As a result, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available for sale in each community to meet demand. At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 335,000 lots, of which 34% were owned and 66% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total own lots are finished and at least 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio includes an ample supply of lots for homes at affordable price points and continues to provide us a strong competitive position. David? David Auld : Our third quarter homebuilding investment in lots land and development totaled $1.1 billion, of which $390 million was for finished lots, $380 million was for land development, and $290 million was for land. $180 million of our land and lot purchases in the third quarter were for Forestar. After slowing our lots and land and development investments in March and April, we have since increased our pace of investments to ensure we maintain an adequate number of finished lots to support our home construction base. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our major \u2013 our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well during this volatile time and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 200% and net income growth of 80% fiscal year-to-date in 2020. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s lot position consisted of 50,700 lots, of which 38,300 are owned and 12,400 are controlled through purchase contracts. 77% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $700 million of liquidity, which includes $350 million of unrestricted cash and $350 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At June 30, Forestar\u2019s net debt-to-capital ratio was 25.2% and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity, and its relationship with D.R. Horton; Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $68.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 43.9% compared to $48.1 million and 40.2% in the prior year quarter. Despite the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets in March and April caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act, our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages that originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on some of our FHA and VA loan originations during the third quarter due to disruptions among mortgage servicers and we will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage markets and adjust our operations to adapt to changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 97% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 71% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 53% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 718 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 91%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, reflecting our continued focus on offering homes at affordable price points. Mike? Mike Murray : DHI Communities is our multifamily rental company focused on suburban garden style apartments that had four projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the quarter. After selling two projects earlier this fiscal year, no other projects were slated to be marketed and sold during our third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2020. We expect to market and sell a couple of projects in fiscal 2021, based on our current pace of construction and leasing activity. After pausing construction starts and new acquisitions by DHI Communities in March, April, and May, we began selectively resuming plans for new projects in June and we still plan to grow the DHI Communities platform. DHI Communities assets totaled $225 million at June 30. We also continue to evaluate our opportunities in the market for single family rental homes. We are currently building and leasing homes in nine single family rental communities across our operations, as we are in the early stages of our participation in this growing segment of the housing market. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. During the 9 months ended June, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion compared to $606 million in the prior year period. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 18.4% at the end of June, was $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding, and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $11 billion and book value per share was $30.38, up 16% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 19.9% compared to 17.3% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $64 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter and we expect to cautiously manage our level of share repurchases in the near-term to maintain financial flexibility until we have better visibility to future market conditions and our expected operating results. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we noted last quarter, due to the uncertainty in the U.S. economy and our business operations from COVID-19, we withdrew our guidance for fiscal 2020. Based on today\u2019s market conditions, we are now providing our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion and to close approximately 18,000 to 19,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter in the mid 21% range and humbling SG&A in the fourth quarter to be 8% to 8.2% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter of approximately 40% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23%. We plan to provide annual guidance for fiscal 2021 when we have sufficient visibility into market conditions hopefully on our next earnings call in early November. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams and it\u2019s relating market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. And we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Your line is now live. Alan Ratner : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and glad to hear everyone is doing well. First question, on the spec inventory supply, not surprisingly came down quite a bit just given the dynamics in the quarter and how strong demand was there. And you mentioned obviously a greater percentage of your backlog right now has not yet started, which makes a lot of sense. I am just curious as you ramp your start activity here and I am sure other builders are doing the same to not only build out your existing backlog, but replace the spec inventory presumably, what are you seeing on the labor side as far as any tightness there, any inflation that\u2019s starting to build up, because it seems like there is a pretty healthy ramp and starts coming? David Auld : Labor has been a challenge throughout this entire market cycle. So, we focused early on, on driving efficiency through the operation, partnering with our labor trades and have seen the benefit of that all the way through this cycle. The reality is, as I think Mike will tell you, the build cycles continue to be very, very stable and just the process of how we build and how we treat our trades has proven to be very effective in managing this situation. Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Second question, so as you start to think about \u201821 here, the sustainability of this demand is certainly a big question at this point, in the last several years, you have done a handful of M&A transactions on the private side and I am curious you mentioned buyback \u2013 potential buyback activity, how are you thinking about M&A right here given the climate and what are you seeing as far as the pipeline is concerned? Bill Wheat : Good morning, Alan. We continue to evaluate different opportunities and it still comes down to where we can add, add to the long-term value of the company, where we can add product and new customer base to serve, but more importantly, people that are accretive to the operating teams. So we continue to talk with several private builders, where we are more inclined to look at the tuck-ins that we have done either adding to existing markets or opening up new markets for us. But you won\u2019t see us probably do any massive public acquisitions, but I do think we will continue to evaluate the smaller privates. Alan Ratner : Have you seen any changes in the privates\u2019 willingness to sell just given kind of the uncertainty in the climate today or has this bounced back in activity perhaps emboldened them a little bit to remain an independent company? Bill Wheat : I would say, it\u2019s both and it\u2019s going to vary based upon the situation of a particular private builder as to whether they are thinking it\u2019s still a good place to be or if it\u2019s time for them to do something different and to join a bigger operation. Alan Ratner : Understood. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Bill Wheat : Thank you. David Auld : I will add that we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not in a position where we need to go at. And it really does have to be a great fit and at this point they would have to want to join our family and it\u2019s not going to be a stretch kind of a win-win for them and us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I wanted to follow-up on the cycle time and spec question that Alan just asked. So you mentioned cycle times are very stable. That\u2019s obviously extremely encouraging and exemplary, I would say. But we have seen your specs are down and obviously demand has surged significantly. So I guess the bottom line question for me is would you like to increase your spec levels from where they are today and are you able to do so in an environment, where demand is as strong as it has been? Mike Murray : Answer to your first question, yes, Stephen, we would like to increase our spec levels today. We have aggressive starts planned to increase our specs. At the same time, we will be starting our sold homes. And so it is a big plan to start houses. But as David mentioned before, we have been focusing early on, on the efficiency, in the product, in the operational focus and partnering with our trades and being true that they are capable of supporting the growth that we have in front of us. So we do think we will be able to increase our spec inventory, but it\u2019s not going to be without a lot of effort, I can promise you that. David Auld : The focus right now is on driving a consistent sustainable start program, week to week, project by project. And as we continue to execute that, I think our spec accounts will come to what we historically have carried. Stephen Kim : Yes, that\u2019s great. Very encouraging to hear and obviously we would \u2013 we look to Horton to take on those challenges. I wanted to ask a second question about pricing and the pricing environment. It would \u2013 it seems obviously that Express remains extremely strong. I am curious if you are seeing increased interest in Freedom and the traditional, D.R. Horton business more recently and whether that allows for a little bit more pricing flexibility perhaps than we had seen in the past, particularly the D.R. Horton semi-custom business. And a second half of that question is whether or not you are seeing the mix of local demand versus out-of-state demand driving what you saw in May and June and is there a difference in your ability to price \u2013 push price for when you are selling to a local versus out-of-state? David Auld : I would say, as to the branding, we are seeing uptick in demand for both Freedom and the D.R. Horton brand. As to the state question, I would say we\u2019re seeing increase in demand from both of my profiles. The relocation of people down to a more affordable tax-friendly environment continues. I think COVID maybe is even accelerating that. Pricing is something we track week-to-week, based upon demand at each individual flag and it\u2019s kind of \u2013 I\u2019ve always considered pricing at our sites. You want to \u2013 you never want to be in a position where you push pricing so hard that you have to come back and adjust it back down. You always want people to feel like if they buy today, they will save a little bit money \u2013 they will save money versus buying 6 months or a year from now. So, fortunately, our company, the entire structure and mentality is that those decisions are made in the individual communities and divisions and the people that are closest to the market actually, we feel make a better decision than we can make up here. Stephen Kim : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Lovallo from Bank of America. Your line is now live. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one, May and June at 50% year-over-year order growth is clearly very encouraging. Just I know you said July was strong, David. Just curious if you could help us frame that in any way how strong it was on a year-over-year basis? David Auld : It\u2019s consistent with what we saw in May and June. John Lovallo : Okay, that\u2019s\u2026 David Auld : It really is a testimony to our people and our positioning out there, but it\u2019s a very-very-very good market right now. John Lovallo : Okay. That\u2019s really encouraging. With that in mind, the overall tone maybe could be seen as just slightly more cautious than some of your peers, which is I think consistent with how you guys have always sort of run the business and I think it\u2019s prudent. But just curious, is this really conservatism just given unemployment, COVID, things that could happen or are you seeing any signs anywhere of any slowing in traffic or whatever it might be? David Auld : No signs of slowing. It\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty out there that is completely outside of our control. If you just look at long-term price in the industry, demographics, where the supply is versus where the future demand is going to be or should be even today, you got to feel very-very good about the long term. But in this industry, I mean you saw what happened at the end of March completely out from nowhere. So, I do think we will have a lot more visibility as we get into the November/December time period next year, and hopefully we can reinstate the guidance numbers that we can then turnaround again. John Lovallo : Thank you very much. David Auld : We are always going to be conservative. I mean, if you got Bill Wheat for a CFO, you are going to have conservative. John Lovallo : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Your line is now live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going back to Alan and Steve\u2019s question about spec and the amount of unsold you have. And maybe Mike or David, is this \u2013 if you look at your backlog \u2013 your sold backlog, are you closer to completion with that than you would typically be at this time of year? And of your unsold spec, are you closer to finishing that than you normally would be this time of year? Mike Murray : So, I would say that we are generally going to be in line with \u2013 the started sold homes are across the range of production largely at this time of the year, delivering into the fourth quarter and similar with the specs. We are probably maybe a little bit less finished with the specs because of the strong sales demand that we\u2019ve had, they\u2019ve moved to the sold category and we have them sort of set to close, if you will \u2013 sold to close in the September quarter. So, we feel really good about the ability to deliver the fourth quarter and the starts plan that we have out and the building permits we\u2019re able to accumulate. We feel good about being able to reload the inventory and bring us back to sustainable inventory levels we need to support the demand. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thanks Mike. Obviously, it\u2019s a function of the vagaries of this market, so just trying to understand the math. And then just a bigger picture question, in your release and on the call, you talked about low rates motivating folks and maybe some pent-up demand, didn\u2019t talk about this idea of deurbanization or dedensification driving demand. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you think you\u2019ve seen and if you have some sort of sense from the field or math that tells you that you\u2019re seeing more and more folks coming from urban areas to purchase homes in suburbs or exurbs? I\u2019d just like your observations on that. Thanks a bunch, folks. David Auld : I think \u2013 well, this is David. I think that\u2019s a trend that was in place before the COVID-19 program and I think it\u2019s really tied toward the millennial being a more conservative disciplined buyer of homes than previous generations. They were forming households later, having children later, and I think this pandemic has accelerated that trend. And like \u2013 what do you call it \u2013 pent-up demand or pull forward demand or there is just a whole lot of people out there that I think are going to be looking for housing over the next five plus years. Bill Wheat : Hey, Carl. I think what you are referring to is a longer term trend I think is continuing as I think certainly pandemics had an effect on it. We would generally agree that that is a trend that probably is accelerating right now, but it\u2019s still too early to know the depth of that and the sustainability of it. So, we try to just comment on what we see in front of us and then we\u2019ll live into the rest and be able to comment on the depth of that as time marches on. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Bill. Congrats, guys. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is now live. Eric Bosshard : Good morning, sir. David Auld : Good morning. Eric Bosshard : Yes, good morning. Curious, in terms of what your plans are in terms of price and incentive. I know you had talked previously a quarter ago about sustaining incentives. But seeing where orders are, your inventory appears healthy; what is the strategy in terms of price and incentive in total? And then secondly, if you could just drill a little bit more into California specifically on that question as well. Mike Murray : So, broadly on the price and incentive, as David mentioned before, it\u2019s a very local decision that\u2019s made. I can tell you that we did see very strong sales demand and so the level of incentives we were offering on sales later in the quarter were much lower than where we opened the quarter with. So, we did see firming pricing trends, firming incentives and in turn \u2013 but to see where that\u2019s going to go, we\u2019re going to need the market and right now we feel really strong about the sales trends that we\u2019re seeing without needing to do heavy incentives. But everyday, at Horton Communities, there is some level of incentives and potential pricing adjustments to meet the market whether that\u2019s up or down, and we do see tremendous value created with the urgency for buyers, as David mentioned before, feeling like they will save a little bit of money if they act today rather than wait for a few more weeks. David Auld : As to California, we are seeing stability and consistency out there today. We have reset our product and positioning out there to the entry level pretty much everywhere we can and it\u2019s driving better returns today than it has in the last 4 or 5 years. Eric Bosshard : Great. And then just one follow-up if I could. In terms of land acquisition as demand has improved broadly and it appears that builders broadly are more active and aggressive in buying land, anything you are seeing different in terms of the competitive environment for securing land or any impact that\u2019s having on the cost of securing land? David Auld : Land prices are going to go up as absorptions continue to move up. So, our focus has been and will continue to be relationships with the developers. The fact that our operational teams in these markets have been there a long time, have great relationships with land sellers I think gives us some advantage. Our ability to close gives us an advantage. Our absorptions per flag, if you are developing lots, you want to be selling to somebody who is going to drive very high absorptions. So it\u2019s \u2013 I do believe we have a competitive advantage, people and capital and just operational efficiency. So I can tell you right now we are seeing a lot of deals. The COVID scare, I think, really created opportunities for us to open relationships with sellers that had been primarily selling through other competitors. So, feel very good about our land position today and the things we put in place to sustain that over time. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the results. First question, I didn\u2019t catch and apologies if you had mentioned it, what your average community count did this quarter either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis? And obviously with the incredible amount of strength and sell-through right now, if you can give us any sense of higher thinking 4Q might trend at least in the near-term? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Mike. Our community count was flat both sequentially and year-over-year. And as you can imagine, with our very strong sales pace, we might not be in a position to see community count growth in Q4. It will probably stay closer to flat, maybe slightly down. But we have the lot position to continue to deliver homes and communities going forward. So, we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive absorptions and ultimately have some community count growth that may just be pushed a little bit further out later next year. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Also with \u2013 I was just kind of curious about kind of on this topic, with Forestar, giving out guidance of midpoint of about 11,000 lot deliveries for next year and I believe that was a little bit below their prior guidance, pre-COVID and understanding that obviously there is a disruption perhaps in some of the development activities for a month or two. At the same time, you guys are looking at very, very strong results currently and into July, I was just trying to get a sense for maybe how that reconciles, Forestar maybe looking at a bit less of a delivery year than originally planned despite demand coming back extremely strong for you. How those two kind of fact patterns work against each other, because I would have thought perhaps and maybe it\u2019s just a more of a timing issue, but a 1,000 lots is not immaterial, so, just trying to get a sense of how to reconcile those two data points? Bill Wheat : Yes, Mike, it is primarily timing. It\u2019s July of 2020. And Forestar was reestablishing just preliminary delivery guidance for fiscal \u201821 at a time in which their largest company \u2013 largest customers not providing 2021 guidance. So, it\u2019s just early, felt like it was important for Forestar to reestablish at least a baseline expectation for their top line growth next year given that they are truly a growth story and the revenues have been up over 200% this year, but it is a bit conservative we hope. And as we live over the next few months and as D.R. Horton gets sufficient visibility to provide guidance for fiscal 2021, our hope would be if certainly if demand trends continue as they are right now, the strength continues in the industry, I would expect that Forestar would ultimately be able to exceed that and increase their guidance over time. This is really timing. Michael Rehaut : Alright, alright. One more quick one if I could \u2013 if I could squeeze another one in. On the gross margins, obviously, a lot of strength there and you mentioned that you are getting some pricing power back obviously, which makes sense? Is there \u2013 and I know you are not giving fiscal \u201821 guidance at this point, but just conceptually perhaps, if you are looking at your gross margins and backlog currently and what you are seeing on the ground, in terms of just achieving some incremental pricing, achieving some incremental scales, etcetera. Is there any reason to think that you wouldn\u2019t be able to hit like the 22% gross margin next year with all those factors just given the momentum you have right now. Again, just trying to think conceptually, obviously, I know you are not giving guidance right now, but just along those lines, if you have any thoughts? Mike Murray : Conceptually, we would love the 22% gross margin. But looking forward, we could see that there could be some headwind coming at us from lumber later into the fourth quarter and into early \u201922 \u2013 early \u201821 excuse me, I am getting confused in my ears. And we do have a backdrop right now of the strong demand environment and some pricing power and relief on incentives. So, we have some positive tailwinds, but we also have some headwinds and there is still the broader outlook that we are looking at here of what\u2019s going to happen in the economy and how the pandemic progresses through the fall and into the winter of next year. So we feel very good about being consistent with our level of margins to drive the right pace that ultimately for us is looking to drive the right return and that\u2019s what we are ultimately looking at it every community says how we maximize the return we built with every [indiscernible]. Jessica Hansen : Yes, our company-wide \u2013 I apologize for the background noise on the line. I am not sure where that\u2019s coming from. Okay. And in terms of our overall company-wide ROI, Mike, we are at 21.6%, which I think is probably a record return on inventory that we have generated that delivering, almost 20% return on equity as well. So we will continue to balance that pace in prices, as Mike mentioned, to maximize returns for both inventory and equity. Mike Murray : Mike, you are off mute, now go ahead, if you said something, sorry. Michael Rehaut : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Your line is now live. Matthew Bouley : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to stick with the gross margin side. I guess, specifically just given some of the underlying pricing strength in the market, how are spec margins comparing versus to be built today? And going forward, when you have this decline in available spec here and in particularly, finished spec, how should we think about what the implication to gross margins would be as a result of that? Thank you. David Auld : Certainly, in a strong demand environment where we have been selling a lot of completed specs, the gap between margins between specs and built-to-order is narrower than normal, but still, typically we do still see higher gross margins on a on a built-to-order versus the spec, but today that gap is a little tighter than usual. Matthew Bouley : Okay, understood. And then just secondly and apologies if I missed this, but, Bill, if you could speak a little bit about the share repurchase plans and sort of what it will take to help to kind of foster reaccelerating that? Thank you. David Auld : Sure. There is a lot of moving pieces right now. We went through a very volatile quarter in terms of demand in terms of what we had to do in our operations and in the adjustments we have made there and still going forward, it\u2019s in our forward visibility. We are seeing extremely strong demand. We have seen a sell-through of our spec inventory. So we are actively reaccelerating our specs now. So first and foremost, we are focused on our business and what we feel like we need to reinvest to keep our spec inventory at the level we would like and keep our lot inventory replenished. And so until we get a better sense of what that need is in the core business, then we will adjust our \u2013 then we will put our plans in place for share repurchase over the next few months, we will be sitting down with all of our operators across the company and putting in place our business plans for fiscal \u201821. And as we get that set, then that will help further define and give us better clarity on what we\u2019ll do in terms of our share repurchase. So, our statement is we are going to cautiously manage our share repurchase and we still have an authorization in place and we\u2019ll update those plans accordingly as we get better visibility in our business. Matthew Bouley : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Truman Patterson from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. So, just I don\u2019t think anybody is really expecting you to run at 50% plus order growth forever just given the supply side constraints. Are you all really focused on thinking in the next quarter to pushing price a little bit harder to kind of curb these absorptions or are you pretty comfortable at this pace in running at these absorptions given your community count and lot count and everything, just trying to understand which lever you are really trying to lean on a bit more going forward? David Auld : Right now, we are very comfortable with our lot position going out into \u201821. We have seen significant and competitive advantage results from the continued consolidation and market share gains. There is \u2013 what we focus on internally is consistent sustainable operations and feel very good about our pace right now. The market is certainly there and the pricing side \u2013 short-term price increases actually increase demand sometimes. So, again, it\u2019s an art and we leave those decisions to local markets. So, like Bill said, over the next 30 days we will be putting together an operating plan for \u201821 finalizing. I guess, we\u2019ve had one for some time, but finalizing it and that will drive a lot more visibility about how we\u2019re going to position for \u201821 and then \u201822 and then \u201823. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. It sounds like your lot positions may be bucking some of the industry trends recently. If I look at your fourth quarter implied backlog conversion rate, it looks like it falls to about 80%, the lowest level in \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 five years or so. I think that\u2019s pretty clearly a function of construction delays or maybe lack of starts during COVID. Do you think that you can get that back up and running where your backlog conversion gets to kind of normalized or flat in the first quarter of \u201821 or second quarter of \u201821 somewhere in there? And then also on that, how long do you think it will take for you to get your spec count kind of normalized in today\u2019s market? Bill Wheat : Well, yes. First, we are not seeing really construction delays. Our cycle times have been very consistent really throughout. And backlog conversion really isn\u2019t a stat that we focus too much on. We focus more on our inventory position and our inventory turns. And right now, we\u2019re seeing our inventory turns accelerate. Our sales pace obviously has increased dramatically in the last few months, which did work down our completed homes \u2013 completed specs. So, our completed spec inventory is lower than it has been in some time. Also, the component of our backlog that is sold, but not started is higher than normal. So, as we accelerate our starts pace, that will bring those to back to a closer \u2013 closer to a normal level, and we expect to still deliver very strong volume. But it takes really our lot position and our home position to support that. Truman Patterson : Okay. Asked another way, your inventory turns will probably be lower in 4Q do you think that kind of gets back to more normalized levels in the first half of \u201821, would that be the case you will see? Bill Wheat : I think they are likely. I think our inventory turns are actually higher than they were a year-ago and I think Q4 will continue that way. I think that was part of our original guidance for fiscal \u201820, was that we expected to turn our housing inventory more quickly this year and that is what we are doing. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question today is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is just around \u2013 obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty as we think about the broader macro environment. And given your buyer base, have you done any analysis or have any thoughts on the impact of the reduction in the stimulus programs that are scheduled to come up later this week? How do you think that that has kind of played into the demand that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months and how are you thinking about it going forward if there are changes there? Mike Murray : Good morning. I am sorry, go ahead. David Auld : No, you go ahead. Mike Murray : What I think we are seeing with most of our buyers and the traffic we are seeing is that those people are not directly participating in a lot of the stimulus programs or relief packages that are out there. The underwriting required for a mortgage today is generally going to first start with a job and a steady predictable income stream. And so, we\u2019ve not seen a direct impact to that. To the extent there is a broader follow through to the economy, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. That\u2019s part of the conservatism I think in our outlook going forward is to see how that plays through in the broader economy. David Auld : And just to add, the amount of stimulus that\u2019s already been pushed out and will continue to be pushed out I think between now and the end of the year is going to impact the markets for multiple years. It\u2019s just a lot of liquidity that will filter through the overall economy and I think have a positive impact on housing and people\u2019s ability to buy a house. Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you noted in your commentary that the average size of the home came down 3% in the quarter. But as we kind of look out at some of the secular shifts that are perhaps coming through from COVID, more people working from home, their kids being home a lot more; are you seeing any of your buyers that are actually looking for a slightly larger home or more space or any kind of changes to the layout? Mike Murray : We are seeing more consideration given to a setting that accommodates a better work-from-home environment, whether it\u2019s an extra bedroom to be used for a classroom, an office, a playroom that provides a little more space. But a lot of our floor plans today accommodate at a lesser aggregate square footage, a lot of very functional space, whether that\u2019s flex rooms or four bedrooms that work very well for them today. So, we are really pleased with the product offering that we have out there. But fortunately, in most of our neighborhoods, we are able to respond to buyer demand very quickly and adjust to what the current buyers in our sales offices are asking for with our inventory homes with the next round of starts we have in given neighborhood. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Question on SG&A a little bit, as you are trying to ramp back up on the land spend and get some more flags in the ground, is there any sort of near-term disrupt \u2013 not disruption, but are you going to have to reinvest in hiring people or do you need to start reaccelerating technology investments to keep up with the pace of demand right now? Is there anything on the SG&A side that we should consider in the near-term as demand has so rapidly increased that you need to accelerate some investment there? Bill Wheat : No, Buck, I don\u2019t think we see anything that will move the needle dramatically. It\u2019s just a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing. We did briefly have a hiring freeze during that month or so at the beginning of the pandemic, but we\u2019re back to normal in terms of hiring across our homebuilding and financial services operation. We are growing the business. We are always hiring and adding where we need to. Same thing on technology, we\u2019ve been making continuing investments over the last number of years and we\u2019ve redirected some of those during the pandemic to address the work-from-home environment and a few things like that, but those expenditures are not anything that\u2019s really out that it\u2019s going to move the needle in total, because there\u2019s also things we\u2019re not spending as much money on today. Travel is not as big a portion of our spending as in the past. Hopefully at some point it can be. But we are in a company lull in terms of our historical SG&A percentages and expect to be able to stay at that level going forward. Buck Horne : Alright, great. Congrats and very helpful. Thank you. Next question just is on the single-family rental component. It seems like your thoughts have evolved on that potential market opportunity and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of maybe the potential for a build for rent product offering in your communities. I just wonder if you could expand upon your thoughts at this point. Is that something you would like to have a portfolio that you could operate internally? Would you look to sell those as you build them or partner with another operator? Just how do you think about single family rentals at this point? Mike Murray : Buck, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re still learning our way into. We feel really good about the handful of communities, I believe nine communities today that we have homes being constructed for the purpose of rental and we will have to see. We will have to see what the market brings us if we bring some of those communities to market for sale or if we build a portfolio to operate or aggregate to a portfolio for eventual disposition. It\u2019s something we are learning our way into today. So we will be back with you as that progresses. Buck Horne : Okay, fair enough. I appreciate it. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I wanted to go back to the sold but not started in backlog and I think you guys mentioned a few times and Bill, you responded to a previous question that percentage is higher than normal, which makes sense. Could you actually \u2013 could you give us what that percentage is in terms of what\u2019s sold but not started and how that compares on a year-over-year basis? And maybe as part of that, I don\u2019t know if you have any quantification of kind of like what an average \u2013 I know your build cycle is flat, but what an average delivery quote would be in terms of what you are able to quote to new buyers today versus what you would normally be able to? Mike Murray : I\u2019ll take the second part of the question while Bill and Jessica are looking for the answer to the first part. Right now, we would not be able to quote to you an average because it\u2019s going to vary based upon which community you\u2019re in and the level of production that\u2019s available within that community and the type of product that it is. In some communities, we have a very quick build time and can deliver homes from start to completion in three months. In others it may be a four or five-month build cycle. And then generally, we\u2019re looking if we have inventory that\u2019s available to move in within the next 30 days as soon as you can clarify your mortgage situation and get qualified. We\u2019d like to have a home that\u2019s ready for you as soon as you can \u2013 you need it. Mike Dahl : Got it. Thanks. Jessica Hansen : And then, Mike, on the sold not started, we\u2019re running low double digit a little over 10% sold not started, which we normally I think would be in a low single-digit percentage. Maybe\u2026. Mike Dahl : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then second question and not to belabor the pace versus price too much, but understanding that it\u2019s a local decision. The \u2013 are you getting the sense that your local operators are \u2013 given some of the uncertainty that may still be out there, they are making the decision to let pace run a little hard for the foreseeable future just to capture what\u2019s out there while it\u2019s still out there type of mentality versus those operators pushing price more aggressively. I know you talked about incentives coming down but just wondering if you have kind of a pulse of what your local operators are leaning toward today? David Auld : Mike, the pace versus price versus margin has a lot to do with community size or it is in the community. You may push price in a community where you\u2019re on the back end of it and your deliveries sales pace is going to be three or four months\u2019 worth of inventory or 6 or 7 months\u2019 worth of inventory. And then you have other communities where you might have a thousand lots in front of you and driving pace actually generates a higher return than trying to find that absolute right margin dollar that either cuts off sales or allows sales to increase. And we trust our operators in the field to make those decisions we incentivize them to make good decisions. And it\u2019s a model that\u2019s been a part of the company for the 32 years I\u2019ve been here and it seems to be working. So, it really is a community by community process. Mike Dahl : Got it. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up to that then, as you think about the 2021 plans, is that when you may introduce a little more kind of nudging in one direction versus the other or is it you\u2019re really just \u2013 I mean, what you are seeing today is pleasing in terms of how everything is being managed? David Auld : We could do better and we can make better decisions pretty much every day. You get up and don\u2019t make a mistake, you probably didn\u2019t do anything. So, we\u2019re going to walk through communities with our operators and we\u2019re going to talk to them. Are you making the decision that is going to drive the highest return for the shareholder? But ultimately, what we have seen over years and years and years is that when you empower people and you give them authority and responsibility, they become better managers and their relationship \u2013 it\u2019s a culture. I mean, it\u2019s who we are. And we are just not going to sit up here and try to drive pricing decisions in a community and pick any market you want to. Mike Dahl : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to David for any further or closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking to you again in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, once again, you have outperformed the industry, setting record \u2013 all-time record for sales \u2013 21,500 sales, unbelievable accomplishment. D.R. Horton, the entire executive team, we are humbled and thankful that we are here to represent you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will call the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Thank you. You may begin. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 financial results. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are or will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-K towards the end of next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team faced the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included an 81% increase in net sales orders to 23,726 homes and a 60% increase in consolidated pretax income of $1.1 billion and a 27% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 340 basis points to 16.5%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 66% to $2.24. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 40% to $3 billion on $20.3 billion of revenues. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 260 basis points to 14.7%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 49% to $6.41. We closed a record 65,388 homes this year, an increase of over 8,400 homes or 15% from last year. Our homebuilding return on inventory was 24.6%, and our return on equity was 22.1%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial service teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton's scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our homebuilding cash flow from operations of 2020 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated over $5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations, while growing our consolidated revenues by 88% and our earnings per share by 216%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value and reduced our homebuilding leverage to 17.5%, while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Housing market conditions are currently very strong and our teams are focused on maximizing returns, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced team\u2019s position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments in each of our communities based on local housing market conditions. With 38,000 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in October, we are well positioned for another great year in 2021. Mike? Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 increased 66% to $2.24 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 49% to $6.41. Net income for the quarter increased 64% to $829 million, and for the year, net income increased 47% to $2.4 billion. Our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results include income tax benefits of $15.8 million and $93.4 million related to federal energy efficient homes tax credits that were retroactively reinstated earlier in the year. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 28% and to $6.1 billion on 20, 248 homes closed, up from $4.8 billion on 16,024 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $302,600, up slightly from last year, while the average size of our homes closed was down 3%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 81% to 23,726 homes, and the value of those orders was $7.3 billion, up 84% from $4 billion in the prior year. We sold 10,596 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year. This positions D.R. Horton to achieve further gains in market share and scale as we deliver during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year and was up 2% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $307,600, up 2% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, down from 23% in the prior year quarter. We believe the increase in demand in the second half of our fiscal year was fueled by increased buyer urgency due to lower interest rates, a limited supply of homes at affordable price points and, to some extent, pent-up demand from the pandemic slowdown earlier this year. We were and remain well positioned for this increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. We continued to see strong increases in net sales orders of greater than 50% in October compared to the same month last year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 22.7%, up 110 basis points sequentially from the June quarter and up 170 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from June to September exceeded our expectations and was primarily due to the strength of the overall housing market, which resulted in some pricing power and lower sales incentives. On a per square foot basis, our revenues increased approximately 4% sequentially, while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 1.5% and our lot cost increased 6%. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace relative to our lot supply and production capacity in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. We expect both our construction and lot costs, and our home prices will increase on a basis in our homes closed next quarter. And we expect a further reduction in the average size of our homes closed. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter, to be around 23%. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 90 basis points from 8.5% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 8.2%, down 50 basis points from 8.7% in 2019. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the year with 38,000 homes in inventory. 14,900 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,900 were completed. We also had 1,800 model homes, at the end of the year. Due to our strong sales increases in the second half of the year, especially for homes which were available for quick delivery. Our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than recent years. As we mentioned on our last call, we have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes available to meet demand. We made good progress to increase our homes and inventory during the fourth quarter. And we expect to increase them further, during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 377,000 lots, of which, 30% were owned and 70% were controlled new purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished, when we purchase them. Our current lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes. David? David Auld : Our fourth quarter homebuilding investment in lots, land and development totaled $1.6 billion, of which $690 million was for finished lots, $500 million was for land and $380 million was for land development, $330 million of our land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were for Forestar. After briefly slowing our investments in lots, land and development earlier this year and the beginning weeks of the pandemic, we have since increased our pace of investment to ensure we maintain an adequate lot supply to support our strong sales and home construction pace. As a result for the year, we invested $5 billion in lots, land and development. Mike? Mike Murray : In October, we acquired the homebuilding operations of Braselton Homes, the largest homebuilder in Corpus Christi, Texas for $23 million in cash. The assets acquired included approximately 90 inventory homes, 95 finished lots, control of 840 additional lots new purchase contracts, and a sales order backlog of 125 homes. We welcome the Braselton team to the D.R. Horton family. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 49 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high-growth expectations with revenue growth of more than 100% and net income growth of 84% in fiscal year 2020, while they continued to build out their national operating platform. At September 30th, Forestar's lot position consisted of 60,500 lots, of which 42,400 are owned and 18,100 are controlled through purchase contracts. 72% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our master supply agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $740 million of liquidity, which includes $400 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At September 30, Forestar's net debt to capital ratio was 22.1%, and their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to navigate through changing economic conditions and continue to grow their business. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter increased 100% to $121 million with a pretax profit margin of 54.9% compared to $61 million and 44.8% in the prior year quarter. For the year, financial services pretax income was $245 million on $585 million of revenue, representing a 41.9% pretax profit margin. Despite the disruption in the secondary mortgage markets earlier this year caused by COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the impact of the Cares Act, our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages it originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on a portion of our FHA and VA loan originations in the third quarter due to lower valuations offered by mortgage servicers. Servicing values have since improved, and we expect to sell these rights to third parties. We will continue to monitor developments in the mortgage market and adjust our operations to adapt to changes in market conditions. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies were in originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First-time homebuyers represented 58% of the closings handled by our mortgage company, up from 50% in the prior year quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : DHI Communities is our multi-family rental company focused on suburban garden-style apartments that had five projects under active construction and one project that was substantially complete at the end of the year. These projects represent 1,730 multifamily units, including 1,430 units under active construction and 300 completed units. DHI Communities sold two projects during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021, we expect to begin marketing two or three projects for sale. However, we will be flexible on the timing of these sales based on market conditions. We expect new apartment sales to occur in the first quarter. DHI Communities assets totaled $246 million at September 30. As we mentioned on our last call, we are also continuing to evaluate our opportunities in the single-family rental home market. During fiscal 2020, several of our homebuilding divisions began constructing and leasing homes as single-family rental properties. At September 30th, 2020, our homebuilding fixed assets included $87.2 million related to our single-family rental platform, representing 10 communities totaling 740 single-family rental homes in finished lots, of which 440 of these homes are complete. After each of these rental communities is constructed and achieves a stabilized level of leased occupancy, we expect to market and sell the entire community. We expect our total investment in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double by the end of fiscal 2021. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During fiscal 2020, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past five years totals $5.2 billion. At September 30th, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.5% at fiscal year end, with $2.4 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and $400 million of senior note maturities in the next 12 months. Subsequent to year end, we issued $500 million of 1.4% homebuilding senior notes due in October 2027. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust changing conditions and opportunities. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $11.8 billion, and book value per share was $32.53, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.1%, an improvement of 490 basis points from 17.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $63.7 million. For the year, we paid cash dividends of $256 million and repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $360.4 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the third and fourth quarters, but we expect to resume share repurchases during fiscal 2021. Our outstanding share count is down 1% from a year ago, and we currently have an outstanding share repurchase authorization of $535 million. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 14% to $0.20 per share. We currently expect to pay dividends of approximately $290 million in fiscal 2021. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Based on today's market conditions and looking forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $5.4 to $5.6 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 17,500 and 18,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be around 23% and homebuilding SG&A in the first quarter to be approximately 8.9% of homebuilding revenues. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin in the first quarter of 35% to 40%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24%. Looking further out, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full fiscal year of 2021 of $24 billion to $25 billion and to close between 77,000 and 80,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2021 of approximately 24%, and we currently expect our outstanding share count at the end of fiscal 2021 to be approximately flat with the end of fiscal 2020. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for the level of our homebuilding cash flow in fiscal 2021 at this time as we prioritize investing in attractive return opportunities in our homebuilding business. Augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories, after much better-than-expected demand this year and potential M&A. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities include significantly increasing our investment in both our multi and single family rental platform, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend, which was just recently increased and repurchasing shares to keep our outstanding share count flat year-over-year. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and affordable product offering across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your reference during 2020 have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you safely continue helping our customers close on their much anticipated new homes. We closed the most homes in a year in our company's history and are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, you reached 70% options even faster than we anticipated and there was a pretty nice jump from around 65.7% in the third quarter. The question is, I mean, do you expect to be able to kind of grind higher from here or was there something unique in the quarter that allowed you to step-up that option percentage? David Auld : John, I would say there isn't anything unique. It's just the continuation of hard work and focus. And yes, our expectation is we will continue to grind higher. Jessica Hansen : It's really a combination of both Forestar's growth and our increased relationships with third party developers. They're both driving that percentage higher. Mike Murray : And John, as we said, from quarter-to-quarter, you could see some volatility, some quarters could be up, some could be slightly down, it can bounce around a little, but the general trend will be continuing to grind higher. John Lovallo : Okay. That's really helpful. And then in terms of the liquidity position, you guys announced the dividend raise today and the fact that you'll buy back shares to keep the count \u2013 the share count flat and also your plans to reinvest in the business. But $2.6 billion of cash is a lot. I mean is there any reason why you wouldn't become more aggressive on buybacks? Bill Wheat : We'll evaluate that, compared to the alternative opportunities in the business. But clearly, with the returns we're seeing in the business today and the demand that we're seeing. We have a need to reinvest in our homebuilding business significantly to put our homes and inventory at a level to meet demand, and have our position and position to meet demand as well. As we look at our cash balances, our scale and our volume and level of activity in our business, is significantly higher than it was even just 2 or 3 years ago. And so we do expect to maintain a higher cash balance going forward, than we have historically. I think you will expect to see from us, at a minimum at quarter end will always be in homebuilding cash greater than $1 billion. But I think most often, you'll see our cash balance between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And just for a frame of reference, we feel like that's an appropriate level of cash to maintain in the homebuilding business to support our activity. Because just as a frame of reference, on a monthly basis, our cash spend for our accounts payable, for our home construction, land and land development, payroll taxes, basically, all of our cash expenses range between $1.7 billion and $2 billion every single month. So maintaining $2 billion of cash is not excessive. I really feel like it's an appropriate level for our business. And also gives us flexibility then, when we see changing market conditions or opportunities, to adjust and take advantage of those. John Lovallo : That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks a lot, guys, impressive quarter, exciting times. My first question relates to production rates. And in particular, I was looking at your homes under construction, which were up 34% year-over-year, if you include model homes. And then, relative to that 17,500 to 18, 000 closings number in 1Q, which seemed a little low to me. But your, - given your backlog, I mean, I assume that they don't close in 1Q but close in 2Q. But talking about this, homes under construction up 34%, is that kind of rate 30% to 40%, let's call it, growth in homes under construction, a sustainable rate in your eyes for, let's say, the next six months? Or is that something you were able to do kind of as a first sprint, but that's not in your view, sustainable, be curious to see what you say about that? Mike Murray : Good morning, Steve. We anticipate, the homes we've gotten started in the fourth quarter are really going to help us deliver the backlog and deliver new spec sales in Q1 and then into Q2. But because we started so many homes in Q4, they're not as far along in the production process, as they normally would be. So they're perhaps a little younger than the average balance might have been. Plus, we just had fewer completed homes in inventory, at the end of September this year, than we did last year. So it's going to take a while to complete our homes and deliver in Q1 or Q2. I think we'll see an elevated level of homes in inventory going into the next quarter. And then we're going to monitor for what we see in spring selling conditions. And we'll adjust to meet demand. Right now, we feel really good about the outlook for the market. And see a lots in front of us and the production capabilities to continue starting homes, and delivering to the higher demand levels. Stephen Kim : Great. So in that response, I really didn't get a sense of that the growth that we saw in the homes under construction was something that overly stretching your capacity. So I mean, you're going to gauge market conditions. But in terms of your ability to scale, I'm not getting the sense that you've sort of overstretched yourself. Correct me, if that's an incorrect translation of what you said. David Auld : Steve, it's David. Everything we do, we think about scalable, sustainable of being a major factor in the thought process. So our lot position, our forward lot position, the deals we control and have being delivered to us, best I've ever seen. The market is the best I've ever seen. But a one quarter pop and starts doesn't help. So if you can't sustain it, it really adds a little value. Stephen Kim : Yes. And you've been really clear about that. Thanks for that. David Auld : We feel very, very good about where we are and what the market is giving us. Stephen Kim : That's encouraging. My second question relates to gross margin. The gross margin you put up in 4Q, if I'm not mistaken, was the strongest you've seen since 2006, and it certainly seems like there's a pretty significant upward trajectory in that gross margin with a lot of momentum. You guided three months ago to a gross margin level substantially lower than what you actually did, not complaining. But I would just be curious as to what the drivers to the excess or the overage or the outperformance in the gross margin was -- and particularly, how it came in over the course of the quarter that led you to be so pleasantly surprised and us too? Bill Wheat : It's a combination of several factors, Steve. It did exceed our expectations. When we spoke - last spoke in July, we were seeing unusual demand into the summer. But I think we still had some question as to how long it might sustain. And fortunately, for the market, we continue to see very strong demand all the way through the end of our September quarter, and of course, we commented through October. So we had certainly more pricing power throughout the quarter as we were selling through our spec inventory than we had anticipated. We also had some anticipation that we might see a bit more cost increases come through than we have thus far. Those are still coming. We see those coming in the next quarter, but we did not see as much cost increases in our stick and brick as we would have anticipated in July. Stephen Kim : That's great. Sounds like Brad and the team are doing a good job as everybody else is, too. So thanks very much guys. Good quarter. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about the breadth of demand when the pandemic started and your business started to improve a lot of chatter about the low-end and spec homes trading at a premium. As you've looked over the last quarter or two, have you begun to see that broaden, David, into both 2-V builds and into other segments, including sort of the Emerald brand, Freedom brand and the higher end of the Horton brand? David Auld : Carl, we've seen better demand across the spectrum. Having a house that you're going to deliver in 30 days, I did think put you in a very strong position to drive value for the shareholders. So as Mike said, our inventory is much younger. But the demand is out too. It's - I don't know if I've - how many times I've said it but in 32 years, best market I've seen. And it does feel sustainable, unlike what was the fast demand in the last big up-cycle. Carl Reichardt : Thank you. And then Jessica, you mentioned towards the end of your remarks about more substantial investment in multifamily and single-family rental. And then I think you mentioned M&A. And given the cash balance and the returns you're seeing in housing generally. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunities that you see in multifamily and single family rental? And has anything changed in the M&A environment that makes you more interested besides the fact that returns are great right now on homebuilding? Jessica Hansen : No, I think we've taken a balanced approach across our business, and I did mention that we're first and foremost focused on reinvesting in our homebuilding business, because we see very attractive return opportunities. But the great thing about what we've done with our business model, as you know, Carl, over the past few years, generating over $5 billion of cash flow in the last five years, gives us a lot of opportunity to not only reinvest in the homebuilding business, but also invest in these other opportunities that we also do think will over time be returns accretive as well. Both multifamily, single-family, we look to those as very strong opportunities. We did take a brief pause on some of that earlier in the year, but now that the market has recovered and really the pandemic slowdown didn't last nearly as long as I think anybody would have expected. We're back to investing in both of those businesses as we would have originally expected. I think Mike said in his prepared remarks, we would expect to double our investment in both of those platforms in fiscal 2021 as compared to the end of fiscal 2020. And then M&A, you've heard us talk about, I think, every single quarter. It's something we continue to be interested in. But with our footprint, our platform, our people, we are in a very strong position to where we can organically grow and deliver on our growth expectations, continuing to consolidate share regardless of M&A, so we can be very opportunistic on that front. But we are interested in continuing to explore those opportunities. If we find the right builder, the right team, the right platform, of course, at the right price. But it can be a very great way to enter a new market, as you saw us do this quarter with a relatively small acquisition we did that gave us interest in trend, excuse me, into a new market in Texas and Corpus Christi. David Auld : And I'd just add on to that, Carl, that we see the rental operations, those businesses. Yes, we have capital that we see to invest or will we find that there's a real synergistic operating platform with our homebuilding builders. And we've seen that in the sourcing of opportunities as well as the execution of construction and just our general approach and focus on the business. So we've been really excited about the opportunities and the returns we see on the horizon there. Mike Murray : And Carl, I'll just add, again, back to the scalable, sustainable program. Large percentage of the population in the US, they never got to own a hold, sad is it has to say. And I do think having the capabilities to execute on the rental side does derisk our operating platform somewhat and will add a significant value to the shareholders as we build that platform out. Carl Reichardt : I appreciate it. Thanks a lot folks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the phenomenal quarter and results. My first question is just thinking about the volume growth rate. Traditionally, I've always kind of thought about the trend in your spec inventory is a pretty good barometer of where you see the order book growing over the next quarter or two. And it seems like recently, there's been a fairly wide disconnect there with spec inventory trending lower year-over-year and order growth hitting new all-time highs for you guys. So it seems like you're seeing a greater percentage of your business now on the to be built side as opposed to spec, just looking at current order activity. So first, I was curious if you could quantify what that mix looks like. And also, how high do you \u2013 are you comfortable taking that to-be-built component of your business going forward, recognizing that it's probably pretty tough to keep pace with the spec starts and the demand today. Mike Murray : Yes. I would pick up the last comment you made, that it is very tough to keep up with demand today. If we start a home, we see that there's demand for it and it's absorbed in the marketplace. With regard to our to be built sales, we're still seeing about the same proportion of our sales coming through in the to be built. I would say that it is higher as an absolute number being higher because our total sales demand is much higher than it has been. But we continue to focus on starting our specs and starting out to-be-built and then limiting the sales availability for to-be-built in various decorates, being sure that we have the capacity to start that home within a reasonable time frame that it's within our control to do so and not to leave it out there for a long period of time. Jessica Hansen : And so a lot of the houses we're starting today are just pre-planned production starts that were how we were going to start anyway. So we don't necessarily think about them as it to-be-built. It's still very efficient. We're just selling into that pace before we've actually started that home. It's not necessarily a pickup and build jobs it takes a little bit more of a build time and offers more customization or option. Mike Murray : With the sales office a few months ago and the agent I was talking to said that, foundation is the new carpet. And that as soon as we get a foundation going in, there's tremendous demand that people want to get onto that house and be in line by it. Alan Ratner : Got you. That's very helpful context. And second, we've heard from a lot of your competitors about the need to intentionally slow sales activity for a multitude of reasons, either closing out of communities faster than expected, difficulty sourcing labor, difficulty sourcing materials, not wanting to extend the backlog too far where you don't have visibility into costs. So I'm just curious, it doesn't seem like you guys are doing that, at least not on a widespread basis. But do you envision having to potentially do that in the near term-based on where your supply side and the demand side is today? Or do you think you can continue selling to demand really indefinitely based on what you see in the market today? David Auld : We approach it from a subdivision-by-subdivision standpoint. And where we have the lots out in front, we build to a pace that maximizes our returns both on equity and inventory. And it's \u2013 it\u2019s really driven by the individual divisions and the markets that they operate in. I can tell you, we have projects where we've raised pricing an attempt to slow down sales and didn't see much of a change in the sales pace. So it really is driven by the production capability of that division in that submarket as to whether they can deliver more homes or they need to slow it down. There is some tweaking of that out in the field, obviously. I mean it's \u2013 you're at the back end of a subdivision, you want to drive the highest margin you can. But if you're on the front end or in the middle of a big, big community, which we have numerous big, big communities, you've got to be very careful with your price appreciation on your sales pace. Because nothing stops us like letting, one guy buy at one price and then having to incentivize or drop the price on somebody else down - in three, four months down the road. So it's - we call it odd not site [ph] in various project-by-project, division-by-division. And we trust our operators out there, who make those decisions. And it's been working for us for a very, very long time. Jessica Hansen : And Alan, in spite of extraordinarily increased demand and up sales this quarter, we did see our community count go up, 3% on a year-over-year basis and 2% sequentially, which is really the first time we've seen a meaningful change in our community count. And that's in spite of 80-plus percent increase in sales this quarter. We've been talking for a long time. So all, I think, that comes up on every call, about when is the community count coming, and we've got the lots. And the community is ready to go. And they're going to continue to replenish our community count and bring new communities online, which is going to help us support our continued growth in fiscal 2021. Alan Ratner : Great. David Auld : Alan, everything we've done, since the last down market has been to derisk our land and loss of ply. And we are uniquely positioned with a very long runway on land and lots. And it's surprising, as it seems. But every time I go out, I see at least one or two deals in the division, that's better than anything else they have today. And that's the result of focusing on the relationships within these markets and treating these trade partners and land sellers, like partners and like, they are integral part of our business. They are an integral part of our derisk, derisking our balance sheet, generating cash flow and positioning us to grow and gain market share, at a pace that is driven by the market, not by our inability to deliver to that. Alan Ratner : That's great. Thanks a lot guys. Best of luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi. Thanks. Good morning everyone. And again, congrats on the results, I wanted to hit on, a little bit of a bigger picture question. I think when you look at how the stocks have pulled back a little bit off their highs in the last month or so, various reasons for that. And particularly with the vaccine out and thoughts - investor thoughts around maybe a market rotation and a return to normal in various ways, I think the debate over the next, call it, three to six months is going to be whether or not current sales pace is peak, whether or not fiscal 2021, earnings is peak. I'd love your thoughts on that. And obviously, from a cyclical standpoint, we're just barely getting back to long-term averages in terms of housing starts. But how do you think about, the sustainability of sales pace that you're currently seeing? If there are any governors on that, again, with regards to the prior question around perhaps restricting sales and allowing your construction pace to catch up. But how do you think about where you are in the cycle, where you are versus peak earnings and the ability to sustain. It's not exactly at current sales paces, but thereabouts to allow your earnings to go higher over the next few years? David Auld : Mike, it feels like there is runway in this market. And I say that because when I'm out talking to the really the division managers within these markets. They talk about employment growth. They talk about population growth. They talk about the positioning that they have. And I just don't get a sense that this is a frenzy or overheated environment out there, where people are speculating on housing. It's family formation, it's downsizing, it's a lot of different things that I believe, anyway are long-term demographic shifts. And when I look at where we are, and what we're doing and our product positioning and our cross point positioning are incredibly deep, very talented, long-tenured employees. It just feels like it's - we got - this market still has\u2026 Mike Murray : And Mike, from a positioning standpoint, we positioned ourselves to be in a very strong and flexible position to adjust to anything that does change. As we look at the broader market, inventory levels are still tight relative to demand. As you mentioned, we're still not back to even normalized levels over the long-term of normalized housing starts. And so from that standpoint, we just want to stay as flexible as we can. We've been through cycles. We recognize there will be times when the cycle turns, and we're going to be in a very strong position to adjust to that. We would never plan out our business model to show an 81% sales increase in one quarter, but we do position ourselves to grow consistently and gain market share. And right now, we're in a very strong market where overall growth rates are stronger than we've seen, and so we're outperforming that. When things moderate to slightly lower levels than they are today, our expectation is we'll be in a position to outperform that. But with a lower risk profile and the ability to preserve the downside on earnings when things do come under pressure at whatever point that is. But again, right now, we see a good market right in front of us, and we're going to make sure we stay positioned with affordable homes and our production in front of what we see the demand to be. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate that. I guess second question, if possible, look to delve in a little bit more and revisit some of the order trend, trend lines that you've been seeing in the last few months. I think you started out the quarter up around 50% or maybe above 50%. I forget the exact language. You ended the quarter with a growth of 81%. I'd love to get the breakout of August and September, if possible. And with October up also around 50%, it implies, obviously, a deceleration from ridiculously strong number, I presume. Just wanted to get your sense, again, gross margins up roughly 150 basis points over two quarters. If you go into first quarter from third quarter, your inventory has sold down dramatically. I just wonder as well around if either some of the price increases that have come through or again, in certain instances, maybe you're just holding back a little bit on sales growth or order taking to allow a catch-up here. If that's how we're supposed to understand where we are in terms of the current order trend because obviously, going from something, obviously, well north of 80% for the last couple of months on average, back down to 50%, just trying to think through the drivers of that. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Mike. So we're not giving specific monthly quarter trends. But we did say back in July, that our July sales were up greater than 50%. Bill mentioned that our October sales are up greater than 50%. And they're not up as high as the fourth quarter as a whole. So you came back into August and September where we're stronger. But as Bill already alluded to, we don't ever have a business plan that our sales are going to grow 81% on an annual rate or really even in the quarter. So it really continues to be a balance community by community. And so there's still some communities that are performing at very, very strong order rates and there are some where we've taken some price because of our - either our housing or our lot position and has slowed the sales pace to some extent to where we've settled out somewhere between that $50 million to $81 [ph]. What we've guided to for the full year for closing is to be at 18% to 22%. We'll see how the spring unfolds. It doesn't mean we can't do better than that based on how we're starting off the year, our houses, our lot position, our product, our people, all of this things we believe put us in a very strong position to consistently outperform the market again in fiscal 2021. But with it only being one-month into the year, that's where we feel comfortable headed for the year. Bill Wheat : But our first quarter guidance for closings is up mid-30s. Jessica Hansen : Yes. Bill Wheat : And so we see stronger growth than that in the first quarter, the short-term visibility. And then longer term, we'll see what sales demand and positioning are as we get into the spring. Michael Rehaut : So just to understand then, what you're saying is that the upside in -- that the upside potential case for closings growth in 2021 could be driven off of a continued robust order pace in the first half and not necessarily production constraints? Jessica Hansen : Correct. Bill Wheat : Don't hear us say we have significant production constraints. There are always some, but we feel very good about our positioning and ability to continue to increase production and sustain production levels. Michael Rehaut : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the percentage of lots controlled through contracts up to 70%. I know you talked about it earlier. I heard you say that it's basically a reflection of kind of the long-term strategy coming to fruition, I guess. But I mean just how quickly you moved up in that percentage in this unusual year. My question is, if there's any kind of measure of risk mitigation that is signaled into how you view the sustainability of housing demand? And I guess the terms on these lot contracts have changed at all or gotten any less favorable perhaps to D.R. Horton on balance? David Auld : Well, again, because of our scale and absorption pace per community, we get favorable terms in the market. The land price has gone up, absolutely, they have, but when the seller is looking at his risk side equation. Do you want investment-grade high absorbing company buying your lots or do you want somebody else buy? And that has worked to our advantage as we have continued year after year after year after year to build relationships with these people. So from a risk standpoint, having a set price, you're drawing a lot at some point in the future is significantly less risky than on the land. So \u2013 and it's also just a much more efficient use of capital. So that's something that we're going to continue to work on and I think get better at. Jessica Hansen : And really, it's been our focus this entire cycle is to push that percentage up. So that percentage increasing is not a read on the market. It's just a read on our continued success in building those relationships, Forestar developing its platform and putting this in a very strong capital-efficient way to run our balance sheet. Yes, does it de-risk us to the downside to some extent, but it's really more about the capital efficiency and driving improved returns. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Understood. Thank you both for that. Second one, just back on the gross margin. I think I heard you say that perhaps cost inflation in the quarter maybe didn't come in to the extent you initially expected. And correct me, if I misheard that, but just thinking about the volatility in lumber prices and how that typically runs through your P&L a little quicker than others. Can you just comment to what extent lumber was a still more of that headwind to come in Q4 and if there is still more of that headwind to come in Q1? Just kind of what's assumed around how that flows through? Thank you. Bill Wheat : Yes, Matt. We would expect that we had a little bit of that headwind in Q4 in the September quarter. But I think we'll see more of it in most of our lumber headwind hit and pass-through in the December quarter, and that was factored into our margin outlook of around 23% for the quarter. Matthew Bouley : Understood. Thanks, everyone. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. David Auld : Good morning, Eric. Eric Bosshard : Two things curious about. First of all, on the cost and input side of the equation, sticks and bricks and labor and land, curious in terms of what you're seeing and anticipate in terms of not only cost but availability. You could just speak to both sides of that, where we are and what you see in the next call it, six or six months? Mike Murray : Yes. We have seen and we telegraphed that we've seen some cost inflationary pressures on some of the lumber, a bit of the other materials and certainly, labor but with our market scale, deep long-term relationships, our production approach and orientation of the business, we're able to work with our local trade suppliers. Aggregate the only market share, but also aggregate labor share in a given market. And by maintaining a sustainable starts pace that allows them to plan their business as well. And it's \u2013 again, it's like what David mentioned to you before on the \u2013 the lot developers. Would they rather work with a production-oriented investment-grade building platform, for somebody else? And oftentimes, we're able to do attract and retain labor through market cycles. I mean, we have consistently paid our bills on time, and worked with these folks as partners through market up cycles and down cycles. And there is long memories here and long relationships. So we're able to get the labor to our job sites. We expect we will have pricing changes. It will go up and it will go down. But we expect to have the FLA [ph] brought our job sites. Bill Wheat : From a material standpoint, as we've said and, is very clearly known in the industry, there are increases that are occurring. And we're anticipating that. All of that is anticipated in our forward margin guide, which we're anticipating a slight improvement in our gross margin going into Q1. From an availability standpoint, there are periodic shortages of certain products in various areas. And so our operators and our national purchasing team is working with our suppliers on, addressing those, making substitutions where we need to, in order to address those. But nothing that is causing significant holdbacks on our production. Right now, current shortage of the day is windows. And so we're seeing probably more issues with windows than anything else. But again, it's just part of the business, part of where we are in the process and addressing those as we need to. David Auld : And I'll say that, everything we've been working on, market share gains, liquidity, derisking the balance sheet. All those things help in any market, but it's a true advantage and a good market. Eric Bosshard : Great. That's helpful. And then, just to follow-up, the gap between orders and backlog and deliveries is as wide as it's been. Do you have any -- I assume the delivery number is as good as it can be, in terms of what you can do. Do you have any concern about the sustainability of orders and backlog, I guess, trying to get to the patients of your customers to wait for, what's probably a little bit more of an extended delivery schedule than they might normally be used to with, your company? Bill Wheat : I think if you look over time, you may see that we have buyers in backlog a little bit longer, during our production cycle, because we've been selling some of our production earlier, in its production cycle. But compared to there are alternatives in the marketplace today, I think you'll consistently find that we're delivering homes faster, than any of the alternatives that are available to those individuals today. So over time, it may change a little bit, but the relative comparison as to what else is available at that point in time, when you make the buy decision, as opposed to as much a repeat customer in a short time frame, it's a different customer comparing competing alternatives. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Adam Baumgarten : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the margins, the gross margins, they've stepped up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter and then you guided for the first quarter. How should we think about the sustainability of those as we move through the year? And maybe some of the puts and takes you may be looking out to going forward? Jessica Hansen : I think we've generally talked about some of the puts and takes. I mean there's three big buckets, right? They go in to [indiscernible] certainly and our labor and our materials and really all three are a headwind today, but we've been able to offset that with price. And I think also manage our increases in lot labor and material is probably better than the industry as a whole because of our scale, both locally and nationally. So the market conditions are to hold and remain a bit robust as we move throughout the spring. We would hope there is some upside to our margin as we move throughout the year. But it's really too early for us to put any color around what the margin looks like for the full fiscal year of 2021 until we see the spring selling season, which is why we're really only specifically guiding to the Q1 gross margin around 23%. Adam Baumgarten : Okay. Great. And then just any commentary on cycle times? Have they changed much? Have you seen any lengthening over the last three or so months? Mike Murray : Actually, been very impressed with their opinions that they've been able to hold and even compress our EBIT cycle times in the build process. We always set goals to get better in our operations every day and pleased to see that the teams have delivered on that. Adam Baumgarten : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey. Good morning everyone. Nice results. Just had a couple questions that I wanted a little more clarity on. Jessica, community count, could you give an outlook for fiscal 2021? And I know you all don't necessarily view community count as a great indicator, if you will. So I'm really hoping to understand, at the local level, are there any muni permitting constraints, any horizontal lot development constraints, zoning board issues, et cetera? Or is it pretty much business as usual and then on - I believe you all already gave a number, but I didn't hear it. Could you give us the number of finished lots you have currently? And then also the number that are under development? Jessica Hansen : Sure. So our finished lot count that was - we didn't give the actual count, but we said 30%. So 34,000 of our owned lots are finished. And then another 50% of our controlled lots are - will be finished when we purchase them. So that'd be roughly 132,000 lots. So roughly 170,000 lots in total that either are or will be finished once we purchase them. In terms of community count, as I mentioned, it was up 3% year-over-year, 2% sequentially. Really, with the size of our platform and the number of absolute communities we already have, we don't generally anticipate it moving much more than that. It's probably up no more than a low single digit percentage and there can be some quarter-to-quarter variability to that as well. But I think we do believe as we move throughout fiscal 2021. On average, our community count will be up slightly. Truman Patterson : Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. And then finally, on some labor constraints, your backlog units are up 96%, I think. Are you all finding enough labor to actually get all these homes started? I know you all build up your guidance from the community and the division level. Are there any areas where you're seeing a large degree of labor constraints or on the flip side? Are you having any local areas where you're seeing I will just called an abundance of labor currently? David Auld : I wouldn't characterize anything as an abundance of labor. But I would say - the thing we look at to monitor that is our overall cycle times. And we did actually see those hold and compress here very recently. So we're very pleased with that. That's telling us that we're getting labor on the job sites and getting the homes completed. And the composition of our homes inventory to be more favoring the backlog is simply a function of demand. It's not taking us longer to build the houses. We're just selling them earlier in the production process than we might have a year ago. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. Mike Murray : I'll just add driving efficiency for the last 10, 11 years is the reason we're able to deliver the houses we're selling. We are - we try to create simple processes that expand our labor base without expanding the number of people, and we are benefiting from that today. Jessica Hansen : Paul, we'll go ahead and give our closing remarks then. David Auld : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. Not only were you the first homebuilder to close more than 50,000 homes in a year, you are now the first to close greater than 60,000 homes and are solidly on the way to being the first to close 80,000 homes in a year. You're truly the best in the industry, D.R. Horton and this entire executive team continues to be hollered and honored to represent you on these calls. Stay safe, stay strong. Talk to you in January. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Christine, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Before we get started, today's call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, which included a 98% increase in consolidated pretax income to over $1 billion, a 48% increase in revenues to $5.9 billion, and a 56% increase in net sales orders to 20,418. Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 440 basis points to 17.4%, while our earnings increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 28%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 24.4%. These results reflect the strength of our homebuilding and financial services teams, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very strong, and our teams are focused on maximizing returns and improving capital efficiency in each of our communities, while increasing our market share. However, we remain cautious regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic or other external factors may have on the economy and our operations in the future. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and experienced teams position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offering, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. With 42,100 homes in inventory, an ample supply of lots and continued strong sales trends in January, we are well positioned for the spring selling season and the remainder of 2021. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 84% to $2.14 per diluted share compared to $1.16 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 84% to $792 million compared to $431 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 48% to $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed, up from $3.9 billion on 12,959 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 2% from the prior year at $304,100, and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the first quarter increased 56% to 20,418 homes, and the value of those orders was $6.4 billion, up 62% from $3.9 billion in the prior year. We sold 7,292 more homes this quarter than the same quarter last year, supporting our plan to achieve further gains in market share and scale during fiscal 2021. Our average number of active selling communities increased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $314,200, up 4% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 18%, down from 20% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in January, and have seen the volume improvement we expect as we head into the spring selling season. We remain well positioned for increased demand with our affordable product offerings, lot supply and housing inventories. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 24.1%, up 140 basis points sequentially from the September quarter and up 310 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. The sequential increase in our gross margin from September to December exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market across almost all of our markets. We continue to see very strong demand and a limited supply of homes, especially at affordable price points, and we still have pricing power and are currently using very few sales incentives. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% from the prior year quarter, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot was down 1.5%, and our lot cost per square foot was up 4%. Sequentially, our revenues were flat on a per square foot basis, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 1.5%, and our lot cost decreased 1.5%. Although, we didn't see the impact of rising costs in our December quarter, we do expect both our construction and lot costs will increase on a per square foot basis in our homes closed next quarter. With the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset these cost pressures with price increases and currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.9%, down 130 basis points from 9.2% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to strong leverage driven by our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point for our first quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Mike Murray : We ended the first quarter with 42,100 homes in inventory. 16,300 of our total homes were unsold, of which 1,600 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. Due to our strong sales in the second half of fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, our level of unsold and completed unsold homes is lower than in recent years. We have accelerated our pace of home starts across most of our communities in the past two quarters to ensure we maintain an adequate number of homes to meet demand. During the first quarter, we started 22,800 homes. We have made good progress increasing our homes in inventory, and we expect to increase them further in the second quarter as we enter the spring selling season. At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 441,000 lots, of which 28% were owned and 72% were controlled through purchase contracts. 30% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio continues to provide us a strong competitive position, allowing us to start construction on more homes to meet homebuyer demand. David? David Auld : For first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.95 billion, of which $1.13 billion was for finished lots, $490 million was for land development and $330 million was to acquire land, $290 million of our lot purchases in the first quarter were for Forestar. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer operating in 51 markets across 21 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar has a well-capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 30% to 35% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 13,500 to 14,000 lots. At December 31, Forestar's lot position increased 74% from a year ago to 77,500 lots, of which 52,300 are owned and 25,200 are controlled through purchase contracts. 67% of Forestar's owned lots are already under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and has approximately $580 million of liquidity, which includes $240 million of unrestricted cash and $340 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At December 31, Forestar's net debt-to-capital ratio was 31.8%. And their next senior note maturity is in 2024. With low leverage, ample liquidity and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a very strong position to grow their business and navigate through changing market conditions. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pretax income in the first quarter was $84.1 million, with a pretax profit margin of 44.9% compared to $30.5 million and 29.6% in the prior year quarter. Our mortgage company has continued selling the mortgages it originates at strong net gains. We began retaining servicing rights on a portion of our FHA and VA loan originations in the third quarter last year because of lower valuations offered by mortgage servicers due to the uncertainty of the impact of the CARES Act. Servicing values have since improved, and we sold a portion of our retained servicing rights during the first quarter. We expect to continue retaining some servicing rights prior to selling them to third parties, typically within six months of loan origination. For the quarter, 97% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 68% [ph] of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 50% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 719 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First time homebuyers represented 56% of the closing handled by our mortgage company, up from 50% in the prior year quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : At December 31st, our multifamily rental operations had four projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are in the lease-up phase. These eight projects represent 2,325 multifamily units. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we currently expect to sell two projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $294.3 million at December 31st. And as we mentioned on our last call, we are constructing and leasing homes within single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. During the quarter ended December 31st, we completed our first sale of a single-family rental community, representing 124 homes for $31.8 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $14 million. We currently expect one more sale of a single-family rental community later this fiscal year. At December 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $106.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 13 communities totaling 890 single family rental homes and owned finished lots. We still expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms to more than double during fiscal 2021. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $269.2 million compared to $178.4 million in the prior year period. At December 31st, we had $3.9 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the quarter, we issued $500 million of 1.4% senior notes due in 2027, and we repaid $400 million of 2.55% senior notes at their maturity. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $12.5 billion and book value per share was $34.33, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into December, our return on equity was 24.4% compared to 18.2% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $73 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased one million shares of common stock for $69.8 million during the quarter and our remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $466 million. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the second quarter of fiscal 2021, based on today's market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $6 billion to $6.2 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 19,000 and 19,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter and our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately the same as the first quarter. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin in the second quarter of 40% to 45%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 23.5%. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $25.2 billion to $25.8 billion and to close between 80,000 and 82,000 homes. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for our homebuilding cash flow this year, as we prioritize augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities include increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend and repurchasing shares to keep our outstanding share count flat year-over-year. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during this time have been remarkable. We are proud of your work ethic and your positive spirit as you continue safely helping our customers close on their much-anticipated new homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host the questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I wanted to talk a little about your underlying costs. Thanks for the info on stick-and-brick and land. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the labor market, David? We're starting to hear a little more, a few builders starting to say things are easing, some others are telling us things are tougher. And oftentimes, you'd like to talk about specific trade specific markets. But I'm interested just broadly, what your expectations are for the labor shortage beginning to ease or tighten in 2021? David Auld : I don't see it being much different than it's been in 2020, at least not for us. We set up and try to drive our communities in the most efficient way, making it the easiest possible way we can for our trades to get in, get out, get their job done. We've actually, I think, through this cycle, have been focused on the labor side and have created a lot of efficiency and have expanded our trade base just by making it easier for them to get in, get out and what they're doing. 2021, our volume is ramping up. I think that's going to continue to be a challenge. But we feel very good, I mean, we wouldn't be selling houses if we couldn't build them, so. Carl Reichardt : Fair enough. And then I wanted to ask a little bit about the West region, which the growth is slower than the really significant growth you're seeing in other places, and inventory is down sequentially as well. In the meantime, South Central, you took more order dollars this quarter than you did last quarter. So I'm curious if you're thinking about shifting capital investment among the different regions as you look into 2021 and beyond. Is there a de-emphasis happening in the West? Or is it - this loan is just a function of being out of product and out of communities? Thanks. David Auld : The underwriting in the West is much more difficult, time lines are longer. So through this cycle, our community count has continued to slip down there. I will tell you, we have one of the best groups of people in the company in the West region. When we talk about platform, we talk about people, product price, and we are certainly - have a very strong platform out West. When the returns in Texas, Florida, Carolinas have been incredible, and everybody competes for capital in this company. So I will say the West is an area that I personally going to emphasize this year, and I think you'll see the growth return there. Jessica Hansen : Carl, for reference, it will be posted after the call, but our West region community count was down 9% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, which compares to the company average, which was actually slightly up in both periods. Carl Reichardt : That will do it, Jessica. All right. Thanks so much everyone, congrats. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. And thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one, just on the NAHB had noted that builder respondents were growing more and more concerned with affordability and home price appreciation and also with rates sort of grinding higher. And maybe not specific to D.R. Horton, but for the industry, I mean, how are you guys thinking about this dynamic? And do you see any risk to industry-wide demand as the spring approaches here? Mike Murray : John, this is Mike. Good morning. We're always focused on affordability that's something that's consistent across the platform. And I'm not as well versed to speak to the industry. But in our communities, we're focused on providing the value at whatever price point we're at. And so whether we have buyers moving up from their current housing situation to a D.R. Horton home or they are first-time homebuyer with 56% of our buyers in the quarter were first time homebuyers. We're focused on providing an affordable home for that buyer that fits in their monthly budget. Jessica Hansen : We continue to see healthy credit metrics across that buyer group. Our FICO score was 719 this quarter. I think on our Express brand standalone, it was almost 710. And then as we also mentioned on the call, our average square footage has continued to tick down slightly on a year-over-year basis. And as home prices have risen, but what we typically see is first time buyers want to buy as much home as they can get for their money, and they're buying out of need, not a discretionary purchase. And so if home prices have risen, they just buy a little bit less house. John Lovallo : Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And then, how are you guys thinking about the potential for increased environmental regulations under the Biden administration? And what this could mean for land development costs and time lines, things of that nature? Mike Murray : Well, I don't think it's going to help affordability. And I believe it's going to extend time. We're well positioned with owning control over 400,000 lots. And again, we're going to focus on affordability. And as regulations increase, affordability is going to become more challenging. But given our position, our people, I think we're - we can meet that challenge. John Lovallo : Thanks very much, guys. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Hey, guys. Fun times. It's interesting the way sometimes the builders are trade, it makes it seem like people think you're just the beneficiary of good luck. But I'm reminded about that statement, you know, luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. And you guys have done a great job over the last couple of years preparing for this situation. And so I wanted to ask you about your comment, as to capital allocation. Because you indicated there that you are, wanting to carry higher cash levels than normal for the foreseeable future. I think you made reference to some uncertainty in the current environment. But arguably, homebuilding is always difficult to predict. And so I'm curious, what is a good rule of thumb for modeling your cash levels going forward and what are the kind of things that you're looking to fade or dissipate, in order to pave the way for you to hold lower cash levels than that? Mike Murray : Sure. Good question, Steve. Just to get to the point in terms of expected levels, we would expect at each quarter end to maintain at least $1 billion of homebuilding cash, but would expect most quarters to see between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. I would say the primary driver behind that shift over the last year is we've been building a little bit more. It's just a significant increase in volume and scale and activity, which feel like it's prudent to ensure that we have sufficient cushion to manage significant sudden changes in the business to avoid having any potential liquidity crunches. That just gives us that much more flexibility to respond when we see opportunities in the market. And so we've seen a number of significant shifts in our business over the last few years from a sharp increase in interest rates, which decreased demand in late '18 to the pandemic disruption in the spring of 2020. To then the very significant increase in demand that we saw in the summer of 2020 and ever since. And so from that standpoint, having a bit more cushion, a bit more liquidity to respond, whichever direction we need to go in the business, we just feel like it's prudent. I don't see us changing that strategy. I think that just puts us in a very strong and flexible position to respond to market changes. Stephen Kim : Okay. Yeah. Certainly sounds like we ought to be modeling that on a longer-term basis. Okay. Second question relates to the pretty awesome margins you all reported this quarter. And I think you just gave guidance as to that margin fairly recently. And so I think a lot of folks are just curious, as to what drove the upside in your margin this quarter? And paying note to the fact that your guidance for the March quarter suggests that it's more than just a temporary spike. I personally think you're still being conservative, but I'd love to hear what drove the upside surprise in this quarter? Mike Murray : Well Steve, I'd say the first thing we expected to see this quarter that we did not as we've been seeing cost increases coming into our business over the last quarter or two, and we expected to see a bit more of that come through in our closings in Q1, which we did not. That's still coming. We can see it coming through our backlog, and we expect to see some of those cost increases start to hit our margins in the coming quarters. That being said, we still have a very strong environment, obviously with the ability to raise prices, very low incentive levels. And so, we do expect at this point now with that additional visibility of another quarter to be able to maintain the current margins that we're showing, which obviously are very strong levels. Jessica Hansen : We've really had price projection on the prior cycle on the material front. And we've seen very neutral impact from materials other than a little bit of headwind from lumber last year. Lumber is starting to pick back up. So that's going into our commentary as well. But really, it's a function of home prices has risen significantly and building product companies have cost inflation as well. And so, we are experiencing some increases in material costs that we didn't see, as we said, flow through in the December quarter, but we do expect those to start flowing through in the rest of the year. David Auld : And I'll just add, our operational teams are doing a great job at controlling costs, where we see increases, we look for efficiencies to reduce cost. And I mean, to be honest, I think we were a little bit surprised a stick and brick per foot, actually it went down last quarter. That's just a phenomenal job by our people. Stephen Kim : Absolutely, great. Thanks very much guys. And best of luck. David Auld : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about the lot position of 441,000. I think you said it really suggests a material addition during the quarter. I guess, number one, could you speak at a higher level, just around what that signals around your view of the sustainability of housing demand? And number two, just the color around the lots you added during the quarter, kind of duration of those lots, lot inflation, any of that could actually impact 2021? Thank you. Bill Wheat : Sure. And Matt, you'll notice that most of that addition to the lot position did come in the form of options lots. We continue to significantly increase our option lot position. We had noted on our last call that we do expect our own lot to increase modestly, and they did kind of get back to a normal level there. But we've been on an ongoing effort to expand our relationships with developers across the country. Of course, our relationship with Forestar continues to bear fruit as well. So, a significant portion of the additions to our lot position through options came from our third-party developers and our relationship with Forestar. And with the significant growth we've seen in demand and significant volume increases that we've seen, that we certainly want to make sure we stay in position to maintain. We probably have stepped up our efforts to ensure that we're keeping our pipeline sufficiently out in front of us with the volume we're seeing today. David Auld : The volume we see today, Matt, as well as looking forward to more medium term, we just don't see a lot of overbuilding, a lot of excess supply in the marketplace relative to household formation demand. And so we want to maintain, as Bill said, adequate support of inventory for that medium term land. So that's why you're seeing our controlled lot position increased. Bill Wheat : And the fact that we're still heavy option does allow us to be a little more aggressive in tying things up. So it's, again, positioning for the future. David Auld : Very capital-efficient with the options. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. That's very helpful color. Second one, I wanted to ask about ASPs. I think, Bill, you might have mentioned or I think you said the order ASPs of 314, I think the backlog ASP is right there as well. So I'm just curious, number one, like-for-like versus mix, if that's just perhaps Emerald [ph] getting a lot better. But then number two, if I look at the closings and revenue guidance for the year, it seems to suggest that the closing ASPs settled back down a little bit. I'm just wondering if you can reconcile that and just how to think about closing ASPs for the year. Thank you. Bill Wheat : Yeah, sure. We always see a higher ASP in our backlog than we do in our sales and our closings because higher priced homes generally are bigger and take longer to work their way through. So that's not necessarily unusual. But yes, so with our sales ASP being at 314 in this quarter, that's definitely showing a continuation of some price appreciation. And so in the near term, we would expect, I think to probably still see some potential upside. That been said, our operators and our teams and our people are very focused on providing affordability. And so we're going to keep an eye on the price points and the payments that our buyers need to have to afford to move into our homes. And so we never plan for significant price appreciation beyond a quarter or two because we always know that at some point, we will make some adjustments in our operations to make sure we keep our price points affordable. Jessica Hansen : And our ASP per square foot on a year-over-year basis was up 4%, but sequentially, it was actually flat. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. Bill Wheat : And so the guidance doesn't reflect all of our price. It doesn't reflect quite all of that price. It reflects that we would still continue to manage very closely on the affordability. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Thanks, everyone. And congrats, again. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Jessica Hansen : Good morning. Eric Bosshard : The increase - the increased delivery number for the year, curious what changed and where that changed and thinking a bit of geography and mix and also the production pace, but just sort of the things that changed that have resulted in you taken a little bit more optimistic on full year deliveries? Mike Murray : I think we've seen consistently strong demand across our footprint, Eric. In addition, as we've gotten the starts up in the first quarter, we started almost 23,000 homes with good visibility to start for the next couple of quarters. And so that gives us more confidence in the number we can deliver for the full year. So just a little clear - a little more of a year coming into focus with what we're going to be able to accomplish. David Auld : We're also seeing a good start to the spring in January, which again, it's about confidence. And we don't want to put a number out there that we don't feel really good about. So we feel really good about that number. Eric Bosshard : From a production pace and inventory pace, anything different that you're doing there or have done there to also allow you to get more homes produced? Mike Murray : Anything different. It's - we talk about sustainability and growing the scale of our platform and doing it in a measured approach that allows us to hang on to those increases. So I wouldn't say, it's anything different. It's just further execution of the same strategy of growing our capacity for production, growing our market share market-by-market. And that's what our teams think about every day when they're getting up and going about their jobs is how I get a little better today and grab a little more production capacity in my marketplace. Eric Bosshard : Great. Thank you. Mike Murray : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the great results. My first question, I was hoping to drill in a bit more on the land side, follow-up to Matt's question earlier. If I'm just kind of looking at the growth in your lot book and obviously account for all the closings you've had over the last year, it looks like over 40% of your current lot booked or lots controlled have actually been tied up over the last 12 months since the pandemic began. And I'm curious, we hear from a lot of builders. When we underwrite land, we assume today's absorptions, today's pricing. And obviously, the current environment makes that a little bit tricky, because your margins and your absorptions are at cycle highs. So I'm curious, as you look at the composition of the land you've tied up over the last 12 months, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about underwriting to gross margin to return on inventory to absorption whatever metrics you guys think about internally? And how that compares to where you're generating business today? David Auld : Our underwriting really hasn't changed much as we've seen absorptions increase, it does - when we're requiring a two-year cash back at a 10 a month absorption, you can buy more lots than you can a five a month absorption. So we have seen the scale of the deals get a little bigger, but the position that from a pricing and location standpoint, I don't see that we've given up much in the deals we're doing today versus the deals we were doing two or three, four years ago. Scale is bigger. The phase sizes are bigger. Lot prices have been pretty stable. And I think I said this on the last call, when I'm traveling and looking at deals, the deals that we put on the books this quarter, we're better than most of the deals that we had on the books. So it's very - it gives me a lot of confidence, and our guys are doing a great job. So I don't see deterioration in our lot position from marketability or really even a pricing standpoint. Alan Ratner : Got it. That's helpful color. Second question on the closing guidance for the year, I just want to maybe get a little bit more commentary there. So if I look at your 2Q guide, your closings are going to be up just under 40% through the first half of the year. And for the full year guide, the midpoint, I think, is a 24% increase, which obviously is incredibly strong. But I'm just curious, what's driving that deceleration in the back half, because your backlog is going to be a very strong - strongly. So is this a function of conservatism around cycle times and just the backlog conversions might be a bit lower than years past because of how elevated the backlogs are? Or is there something else that's driving maybe that you sell in the back half? Jessica Hansen : It's really the stage of construction our homes are in Alan. We have a lot fewer completed specs today than we typically have. And as a result, we're selling and closing fewer homes intra-quarter than we typically would. I think that quarter that was in the 20 - mid-20% range and typically it's in the high 30% or 40% range. So it's really just a function of the stage of our inventory. And we did get, as Mike said, almost 23,000 homes started this quarter, but a lot of those are still in the early stages of construction. And so a lot of the homes that we'll be starting here a little bit later in the year won't be available for this fiscal year, but they'll put us in a very good position to continue growth in fiscal 2022. Mike Murray : And when you look, obviously, at the year-over-year increases, we started to see some very significant year-over-year increases in Q3. Last year, Q3 and Q4 were much more significant. So the year-over-year increases going forward are naturally not going to necessarily continue at the same pace they are right now. But we're still expecting a very strong year, very strong year-over-year increase for fiscal '21. Alan Ratner : Sure. Absolutely. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congrats on the results. First question, I kind of wanted to ask about the underwriting and the gross margins, maybe from another angle and apologies if maybe I'm beating a dead horse here. But with the gross margins at 24%, obviously, that's - you almost have a very good problem to deal with in kind of keeping those margins extensively to the extent possible at these levels, which are kind of rarefied air for you historically. You mentioned earlier that you haven't seen much appreciation in lot prices, lot prices are being pretty stable, and the deal flow is pretty attractive right now. But if home price appreciation were to moderate obviously, today, it's in a, let's call it, a high single-digit type of year-over-year dynamic on a same store basis. If that were to moderate more to like a low single-digit rate, given where you're underwriting the deals to today, should we expect that gross margin to come in a little bit over the next couple of years? Is that the right way to think about it? Or are there other factors that maybe we're not appreciating? Jessica Hansen : We really have no insight to gross margin in the next few years. I mean, gross margin really is a function of the market, Mike. We're focused on underwritings to returns. And although we don't see it right now. Even if we did see a compression in our gross margins for whatever reason, affordability, interest rate, something that we don't foresee today as an issue, we can still generate very attractive returns on our current land, bank with the efficiencies that David's kind of already talked to in our business today and our ability to keep turning our houses. But we feel very comfortable with our current lot position that we are going to be able to offset costs going forward and hopefully hang in around this 24% range. But really further than a quarter out, we don't have a whole lot of visibility because we do turn our houses much more quickly, I think, than the industry by and large. And so we have the best early read on cost and gross margin in the market. Bill Wheat : Can't emphasize enough that gross margin is not part of our underwriting hurdles, returns is our underwriting hurdle. And certainly, higher gross margins can generate higher returns. But we focus, first and foremost, on hitting returns, hitting our absorptions in each community. And then the market, sometimes will give you more margin than you may have underwritten. David Auld : If you look at our average sales price, we are significantly more affordable than most of our peers in the homebuilding space. And our land portfolio and our operating structures are designed and geared to drive that affordability. So are we - when I look at the competitive makeup out there, both of the resale market, which is really, today, our primary competitor at this price points? And our peers in the industry, it's - I mean, we feel very good about our current position and which allows us to underwrite and execute the positions that we believe will keep us in this range. Michael Rehaut : Right. No, I appreciate it. I guess, secondly, I just wanted to zero in on SG&A for a moment. The results were significantly better than what you were looking for, I think, by order of about 100 basis points, yet your closings were only modestly above guidance. So I was wondering, you had mentioned leverage off of the strong volume, but you really had instead of 40 basis points, you know, 140 basis points of year-over-year leverage. And additionally, you're expecting SG&A ratio to be flat sequentially versus historically, a little bit better. So just wondering if there was anything specific to the first quarter, and I apologize if I missed this earlier, that benefited this past quarter more on a one-time basis? Or what kind of drove that differential? Bill Wheat : Michael, thank you. You touched on part of it. Deliveries were a little bit ahead of what we had guided to. In addition to ASP is a little higher, which drives a little more SG&A leverage. Something Jessica touched on before is the lower level of completed inventory, especially the completed specs that we're carrying the business today, able to operate the inventory portfolio very efficiently. And that requires less SG&A to maintain and care for those homes while they're sitting completed because we do run those costs through SG&A. So as we have less of those, we had around 5,000 a year ago. And today, we have about 1,600. So that's - that's an improvement and a tailwind as well. Jessica Hansen : And although we guided to flat SG&A sequentially, on a year-over-year basis, it would actually be approximately 40 basis points of leverage, which is still a pretty nice move. And when we think about it on an annual basis, as our SG&A is already at record lows, we're not going to ever just be able to model and say that our SG&A is going to be down more than, say, that on an annual basis. Can we ultimately maybe get there if you continue see prices rising ASP plays a big role in that? Sure. But right now, we feel like leveraging our SG&A 40 basis points on a year-over-year basis is a really nice move. Bill Wheat : But nothing onetime. Yes, there are some changing conditions and the volume and pricing has helped, but nothing onetime in the quarter. Michael Rehaut : Right. Thanks so much, guys. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nishu Sood with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Nishu Sood : Thank you. So first question I just wanted to ask was around demand trends. A lot of folks are wondering demand has been so strong. What's it going to look like when life returns to normal? I mean, clearly, we're far from being back to normal. But in your last quarter, obviously, vaccine news, there's some hope out there. Is there anything you can - you've seen in terms of the traffic? Or what folks are looking for, how it's evolving that give us any insights in to, how your home buyers are looking at things? David Auld : The demand out there, I think, is really driven by demographics. And I think it has been accelerated, because of the pandemic and people's desire to become - or to find a safe environment for their family. I really don't see that demand issue changing. I mean, it's - it accelerates. It's a long-term program, and it got accelerated. Now that's going to stay. So, I mean we are positioning. We are driving to take advantage of as much of that demand as we can. And it's - I mean, right now today, it's very good out there. Jessica Hansen : A lot of our floor plans in issue actually already incorporated flex space. So depending on what a buyer is looking for today, whether it be a home office, a second home office, a learning space for their kids. Those types of things, we've already always had floor plans that can accommodate that. And we can continue to adjust our starts based on what those homebuyers are potentially looking for. And then the things that have always been true are as people start their families and have children, they generally want a backyard for their kids. They want good public schools, maybe a garage for their cars. Those things have kind of always been true that go along with the demographic side of the equation that David was talking to. So I would say other than the acceleration from the pandemic, and that's being positioned in the right places with a lot of different floor plans to choose from. No significant change on that front. Bill Wheat : And still the strongest demand is at the most affordable price. Jessica Hansen : Yeah. Bill Wheat : And that's been a trend that we've been seeing for quite a while. Obviously, we're very well positioned to take advantage of that. The environment right now with low interest rates, that's accommodated for that as well and it's certainly a benefit for that demand as well, which for right now, we don't really see that changing much in the near term. Nishu Sood : Got you, got you. Makes sense. So second question I wanted to ask was around your inventory levels. So demand has been so strong. Obviously, you folks have ramped up your starts considerably, but still remains - just looking at a metric like your inventory against your backlog just kind of sizing it, still remains behind where it would be normally. Are we in a market where demand is just so strong, it will be difficult to get back to your normal or targeted levels of inventory? Or do you see, as the year progresses here, there could be some progress on that, even if demand does remain, as strong as it has been? Mike Murray : If demand remains at the exact level it is today, it would be very challenging for us to get back to a historical relationship between total inventory and backlog. Demand is that good. We look at our starts capacity, neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood, week-by-week. And we are increasing that capacity over time to make sure it's sustainable. And we're doing it well with our trade partners in mind. So - but while we're doing that, demand continues to expand, to absorb that additional capacity we're putting into the marketplaces today, at the price points we're serving. Jessica Hansen : Really more focused and issue on homes conversion than backlog conversion. I mean, backlog is a function of what we're selling. And we're going to sell, so what's out there from a demand perspective and ultimately, we'll get the house started. We've got the lot positioned to do it unlike anyone else in the industry. We wouldn't be selling the houses if we didn't have the lots and feel comfortable about our cost structure and what kind of return we were going to generate on those houses. So we're really focused on the houses we have in inventory and how quickly we're turning those and rather than a backlog conversion metric, trying to improve our housing inventory turn. And generally, we turn that at least two times a year. Last year, we did a little bit better than that, this year now with our new guidance, we're reflecting better than two times as well. David Auld : And we talk to our operators all the time about being disciplined, focused and consistent and it starts in your communities. And that's how we're building capacity to deliver more homes by that execution at the community level. Nishu Sood : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about expected seasonality for the year. And given the buyer traffic patterns you've seen, does it lead you to believe you'll see kind of a traditional spring selling season or could demand maybe be more evenly distributed throughout the year? And I think we've heard from others that buyers are visiting homes maybe on what used to be off-peak days or off-peak hours. Is that something you've seen? Or can you just comment generally on any kind of changes you've seen in buyer behavior? Mike Murray : Yeah. We've certainly seen very different seasonality throughout 2020. Stronger demand through the summer, fall, winter in 2020 than we've seen historically. So we're coming off of some unusually strong periods. But that being said, with what we've seen thus far in January, we're seeing increases in volume that we would expect to see. It remains to be seen whether we'll still see the same percentage relationships between our Q2 and Q1 that we've seen historically or not. But right now, we just see a very strong demand environment. Definitely some different patterns in buyer behavior than we've seen historically. But feeling good about what we can see going ahead. With a very strong Q1, where we see the same sort of patterns throughout the fiscal year, we historically have seen. I would expect there's probably be a bit of flattening of some of the historical patterns, but obviously, off to a very good start. And I think the way things are looking right now, we're optimistic about the spring. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then it seems like some of your peers are pushing price and slowing down sales pace given some production constraints. I'm wondering if you're seeing markets where price increases by competitors are maybe a bit steeper than yours and has that improved your value proposition for customers? Or maybe to ask the question another way, do you think your affordability edge is maybe stronger than it was 12 months ago with competitors raising prices? Or any kind of general comments on the pricing environment? Mike Murray : If you just look at our average sales price increase over quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter compared to our competitors. And yes, I would say our competitive advantage has increased and improved. But again, it really comes down to the ability to deliver the homes. And I think that's where we've gained the largest competitive advantage with the discipline around what we're doing and the focus on efficiency over the last couple of years. So it's a - it doesn't do any good to sell a house at any price, you can't deliver it. So we're focused on the delivery side of it and expanding our capacity via becoming more and more efficient through our processes. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question. Jack Micenko : Hi. Good morning. We talked a lot about returns. We talked about underwriting, not really focusing on margin. And David, you sound pretty constructive on the land environment. I guess, my question would be thinking about Horton as this longer-term 60-40 option versus owned mix coming in at 72 this quarter. Is 72 the new 60? If the goalposts changed or is it really more of an interim function, that's where the markets kind of brought you in terms of availability of new acquisitions over the last couple of quarters? David Auld : Yeah, actually, 70s [ph] are new 60. We're going to continue to try to grind that number higher. Ultimately, it comes down to relationships and execution in the field. And that's something we focus on every day. So it's my expectation over time is that we will continue to drag a point here, a point there and drive better and better efficiency, capital efficiency through our business and to our company and ultimately, probably the industry. Jack Micenko : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then looking at the single-family rental sale, it would appear that the gross margins on those 124 homes was pretty healthy, it may be in excess of the company margin. Am I looking at that the right way? Or is there something I'm missing? Obviously, you've got your G&A costs and everything below the line. But just from a purely a margin perspective, it looks like that was a really healthy margin on the sale of those units? Mike Murray : Yeah, we're very pleased with that transaction. And we look forward to that continuing to explore that business. It seems to be attracting a lot of capital and a lot of interest today. And we expect to be to take advantage of that. Jack Micenko : All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Murray : Thank you, Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. And congratulations on the results. My first question is just - I wondered if you could perhaps quantify a bit more of the comments around January. Just perhaps framing the magnitude of what you're seeing either sequentially or on a year-over-year basis for us? Mike Murray : You know, Su three weeks in, we rarely comment on a single month, much less just a few weeks. So - but suffice it to say, what we generally expect when we get into January, is we expect there to be a step-up in traffic and volume coming through our weekly sales pace. And so we have seen that. We've seen three weeks of weekly sales thus far, and there has been that discernible step-up in volume in January versus what we had seen in the December quarter. So we're encouraged by that. David Auld : Several years ago, we would - the spring selling season to kick in with Super Bowl effectively at the end of January, early February. The past several years, this year being no exception, we've seen that sales pace accelerate coming out of the holidays after January 1. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And my next question is around what you're seeing in terms of some of the suppliers. We've obviously heard that with the ramp in volumes and some of the supply chain issues that those companies are seeing in their own businesses, that there's been some constraints maybe especially in some areas like appliances and windows. Can you just talk to what you're seeing there? And I guess, maybe in some areas, is there anything that you've heard more recently around the issue with some of the semiconductor supplies and some of the issues that they're seeing in those industries? Jessica Hansen : So really, various products are in short supply, Su. It kind of depends on, what market and what day, would agree with your sentiments on both windows and appliances. We've had challenges in both of those. Our product partners have been working hard to support our business. So we don't have to push back any closings. And we've been very pleased where we have to substitute, upgrade and even install other brands if necessary, to make sure we're not having to push closings. I don't know that I have anything specific on semiconductors that I've heard, as of late. But I really would have put windows again, as the headliner this quarter. It's probably actually gotten even a little worse than when we said that last quarter. Susan Maklari : Got you. Okay. Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Su. Operator : Thank you. Due to time constraints, our final question will come from the line of Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I'll try to keep this one quick. Question we get a lot from investors is kind of just where is all this buyer demand coming from? How sustainable it is at? I'm just curious if you get from a high-level perspective, any evidence of the population migration that seems to be happening around the country. Are you seeing any noticeable uptick in out-of-state buyers or out of market buyers versus your historical normal? And has that changed at all one way or the other since the pandemic began? Jessica Hansen : I would say anecdotally, yes. I mean, we continue to see Texas and Florida as our two strongest space with a lot of diversity just even within those states. But clearly, there has been a flight in a lot of cases from the coast to Texas to Florida, to the Carolinas, and then from the West Coast into Salt Lake into Vegas into Phoenix, and so I think we would expect that trend to continue. And in that regard, really like our positioning as it pertains to our lot position across the country. Bill Wheat : I also like the fact that you don't see existing home inventory levels sale - for sale at high levels, at all, supply is very tight for homes that are available in the next 60 days to 90 days. And that has been a consistent part of our business model for forever is to be an alternative to that used home and provide a customer with a new home on their time line. Jessica Hansen : And Buck, you didn't ask this specific question, but we've had a lot of conversations over the last quarter or so about just the age. And for the last - however many years about our millennial is ever going to buy a home, coming off around 35% of our business in 2019 was to buyers 34 and under. We saw that pretty quickly in the pandemic and through the remainder of fiscal 2020 and now into 2021 tick up to the low 40s. So, I think 42% versus 35% is a pretty big move. And we've seen that settle out to where over 40% of our buyers are 34 and under. I think answering that question that, yes, millennials are going to own homes. Buck Horne : Okay. That's great. That's - okay, go ahead, please\u2026 David Auld : Everything we're seeing has been the long-term trends that we've been experiencing really coming out of the downturn, COVID accelerated it. And it feels like right now that, that acceleration is kind of the new norm going forward. Buck Horne : That's extremely helpful. Thank you, guys. I appreciate all that color. And just one last one on the single-family - rental business, just a follow-up on that, outstanding community trade. I'm just wondering you mentioned that you plan to double your investment in the platform over the course of this year. So it sounds like there's quite a bit of scalable opportunity. How do you think about the total market opportunity for developing single family rentals within your platform? And would you continue on this method of building it yourself, pre-leasing it and then flipping it stabilized? Or would you pre-sell some of these or partner with investors ahead of development? How do you envision the scaling up of that business? Mike Murray : Where we are today with the program is we're still learning the business and the execution side of it. We were very pleased with the first transaction. And as we learn more about the market, we will evaluate various alternatives for how we want to go about scaling it out and ultimately capitalizing it. But we need to know more about what we're doing. We do see a lot of opportunity. We think there is some portion of the population that will be a great customer for this product that desires a single-family lifestyle, but may not, for whatever reason, be purchasing a home. And so we want to build up to be in a position to help to supply this. Bill Wheat : And Buck, just to clarify, the comment about doubling our investment this year refers to our entire rental platform, both multifamily and single family. Our total assets and the combined platform at the beginning of the year was $330 million. So we expect that $330 million more than double in fiscal '21. Buck Horne : Got it. Got it. Thank you so much and congratulations. Bill Wheat : Thanks. Jessica Hansen : Thanks. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Auld, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Christine. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again with our second quarter results in April. And to the D.R. Horton team an outstanding first quarter. We're set up to have an unbelievable year. Stay humble, stay hungry and stay focused. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. An interactive question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Thank you. You may begin. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Melissa. And good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Before we get started, today\u2019s call may include comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and it\u2019s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I\u2019m pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong second quarter, highlighted by 95% increase in earnings to $2.53 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 90% on a 43% increase in revenues to $6.4 billion, and our pre-tax profit margin, improved 450 basis points to 18.3%. Our net sales orders for the quarter, increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and our homes in the inventory increased 38% to 46,100. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12-months ended March 31 was 31.2%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 27.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities while increasing D.R. Horton\u2019s market share. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity, and low leverage positions us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 95% to $2.53 per diluted share compared to $1.30 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 93% to $930 million compared to $483 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 41% to $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed, up from $4.4 billion on 14,539 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was up 4% from the prior year at $313,200 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%, reflecting our ongoing efforts to keep our homes affordable. Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the second quarter increased 35% to 27,059 homes, and the value of those orders was $8.8 billion, up 47% from $6 billion in the prior year. We sold over 14,200 more homes in the first half of fiscal 2021 than the same period last year, supporting further gains in market share and scale. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was flat sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the second quarter was $327,000, up 9% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 15%, down from 19% in the prior year quarter. Our local teams are managing the sales order pace in each of their communities, based on their lot position, number of homes in inventory, and pace of home starts and production. Their increasing sales prices were supported by the market, while remaining focused on providing homes at affordable prices. We are pleased with our sales pace to date in April and remain well-positioned in this strong market with our affordable product offerings, lot supply, and housing inventories. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the second quarter was 24.6%, up 50 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The increase in our gross margin from December to March exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market across our footprint. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 3.5% sequentially, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 4.5% and our lot costs increased 2%. We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase on a per square foot basis. However, with the strength of today\u2019s conditions, we expect to offset these cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the second quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives, and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, down 70 basis points from 8.3% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our SG&A ratio this quarter was better than our expectations and was due to our higher-than-expected volume of homes closed and the increase in our average selling price. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in the March quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure appropriately supports our business. Mike? Mike Murray : We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand. We started 23,700 homes this quarter, up 33% from the second quarter last year and ended the quarter with 46,100 homes in inventory, up 38% from a year ago. 12,200 of our total homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 700 were completed. We also had 1,900 model homes at the end of the quarter. At March 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 487,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 26% of our total owned finished lots - owned lots are finished and at least 45% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position, allowing us to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. David? David Auld : Our second quarter homebuilding investments, and lots, land development totaled $1.7 billion, of which $980 million was for finished lots, $440 million was for land development and $290 million was to acquire land. $270 million of our lot purchases in the second quarter were from Forestar. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary, is a publicly traded residential lot manufacturer, operating in 54 markets across 22 states. Our strategic relationship with Forestar, as a well capitalized lot supplier across much of our operating footprint, is serving us well and is presenting opportunities for both companies to gain market share. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations, and now expects to grow its lot deliveries by 40% to 45% in fiscal 2021 to a range of 14,500 to 15,000 lots, with a pre-tax profit margin of 10% to 10.5%. At March 31st, Forestar\u2019s lot position increased 62% from a year ago to 84,500 lots, of which 58,700 are owned and 25,800 are controlled through purchase contracts. 63% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer under our Master Supply Agreement. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end, which included $170 million of unrestricted cash and $330 million of available capacity on its revolving credit facility. At March 31st, Forestar\u2019s net debt-to-capital ratio was 34.1%. Forestar has been active in the public capital markets recently, issuing common stock through its at the market equity offering program, issuing new senior unsecured notes, calling for redemption of some of its higher coupon senior notes and extending the maturity and increasing the capacity of its revolving credit facility. With low leverage, strong liquidity, capital markets access and its relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar is in a great position to continue to grow their profitable business. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $107.7 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 47.8% compared to $24.7 million and 23.6% in the prior year quarter. The improvement in our financial services operating margin is primarily due to strong net gains on sale and better G&A leverage due to increased loan volume. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 67% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 47% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers' originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 720 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 90%. First time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company in the quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : At March 31st, our multifamily rental operations had eight projects under active construction and an additional four projects that are completed and in the lease-up phase. Based on our pace of leasing activity, we expect to sell two of these projects during the second half of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets totaled $394.4 million at March 31st. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we are now constructing and leasing homes within single-family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieved a stabilized level of leased occupancy, each community is expected to be marketed for sale. Our single-family rental operations are currently reported in our homebuilding segment. There were no sales of single-family rental communities during the second quarter. However, we still expect one more sale later this fiscal year. At March 31st, our homebuilding fixed assets included $182.6 million of assets related to our single-family rental platform, representing 27 communities, up from 13 communities in the first quarter. We now expect our total investments in our single and multifamily rental platforms will increase between $400 million and $500 million from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2021. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the six months ended March, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $138 million compared to $52 million in the prior year period. $215 million of cash provided by our homebuilding operations was due to a deferral of estimated tax payments granted by the IRS as a result of the Texas winter storm this year, and the cash flow impact of this item will reverse in our third quarter. At March 31st, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.9 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.8 billion of available capacity on our revolving credit facilities. We plan to continue maintaining higher homebuilding cash balances and liquidity than in prior years to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.8% at the end of March, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31st, our stockholder\u2019s equity was $13 billion and book value per share was $35.96, up 25% from a year ago. For the trailing 12-months ended March, our return on equity was 27.1% compared to 19.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.7 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 4.5 million shares of common stock for $350.4 million during the quarter, and the remaining outstanding share repurchase authorization at March 31st was $115.1 million. This week, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization replacing the company\u2019s previous authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the third quarter of fiscal 2021, based on today\u2019s market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7 billion to $7.2 billion and our homes closed to be in a range between 21,500 and 22,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 24.6% to 25%, and our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be approximately 7.5%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of approximately 45%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23% for the quarter. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $26.8 billion to $27.5 billion and to close between 82,500 and 84,500 homes. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2021. However, we are not providing specific guidance for our homebuilding cash flow this year, as we prioritize augmenting our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. After reinvesting in our homebuilding business, our cash flow priorities are balanced among increasing our investment in both our multi and single-family rental platforms, maintaining our conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying dividends and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1.5% from the beginning of fiscal 2021. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and expanding production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today\u2019s robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts continue to be remarkable. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. John Lovallo : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. First one, I guess, it really seems like the asset-light strategy that you guys embarked upon a few years ago is really hitting stride now. I mean, option percentage up to close to 75%, and buybacks now expected to actually lower the share count. So these are all things that we had hoped for some time, and again, it really seems to be hitting stride. Two questions on that. I mean where do you now see sort of the target percent option? I know it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but any change in the view longer term on that? And then, has the view now on buybacks, has that changed? Do you think that you'll actually be able to continue chipping away at the share count over time? David Auld : John, I'd say we're always going to try to get better and continuing to push the auction as a percentage of total. We consider that a better utilization cap. So if we're at 75% now, over time, we would expect to turn that into 80%, and we'll get to 80% over time. If different market conditions, it could grow beyond that. So it's - it's just \u2013 you know, like every time we do, we talk about sustainable, scalable, and that follows right on track. We believe that auctioning lots is - will drive better cash flow, better returns to our shareholders, and as our builders on our platforms out there execute that strategy, relationships grow stronger, and it's just a - there's a momentum that I think will continue. Bill Wheat : And then John, with respect to share repurchases, I would use the word sustainable as well there. As we have progressed in our capital light strategy, as we\u2019ve generated more cash flow, as we have gotten in position with our scale to reinvest in our business to support the scale that we believe that the market will bear today. And we\u2019ve improved our balance sheet and our liquidity position. We are now in a position where I do think we have hit an inflection point where I think we can more definitively talk about consistently repurchasing shares and consistently reducing our share count over time. And so, we had a little bit of interruption with COVID last year in which we paused. We reinstated share repurchase last quarter and then this quarter, we\u2019ve accelerated. And now with the new authorization, we are more definitively stating that we expect to consistently reduce our share count each year going forward, and that will be part of our balanced program. John Lovallo : Yeah. That\u2019s really encouraging on both fronts, guys. The second question is, we have heard through the channel of what I would characterize as maybe seemingly aggressive behavior by some of your competitors in terms of whether it\u2019s you know, prices being paid for land, potentially even cutting some corners to get homes closed. Just curious, if you guys have heard any rumblings like this in the market? And if so, I mean, does it maybe suggest that things are getting a little bit too heavy a heal [ph] overall? David Auld : Yeah. John, we\u2019ve seen on a very limited basis some erratic behavior on the land front, where a builder has positioned themselves where they just don\u2019t have adequate or even non-adequate supply of lots, they are buying out of desperation. But it hasn\u2019t been consistent across all the markets and even within markets where I have seen it, it\u2019s not impactful to the overall land valuation. You know, our entire process through this cycle has been to auction lots, take longer positions where we control pricing through this market, and I think we said it on every call, we are incredibly well-positioned on our lot supply. And if somebody is being erratic, then we will \u2013 they\u2019re going to be in a very difficult position to compete if they\u2019re accelerating - if they\u2019re overbidding land price, because we are \u2013 we\u2019re pretty efficient in delivering houses, and our land pipeline is long and deep and very well priced. Bill Wheat : John, back to your other question about closing homes before they\u2019re ready. We\u2019ve been in this business a long time and certainly have kind of learned a lesson that we don\u2019t want to close the home before its time. So we will wait until the home is ready, and the buyer is satisfied with the home to be in there. At the same time, buyers are very anxious to get in their homes. Build times have elongated a bit with supply chain disruptions and some of the labor availability. Our production process, our consistent cadence of starts helps us overcome a lot of that. Selling homes after we\u2019ve started them in their production cycle gives us more assurance of a completion date, and we\u2019re able to better work with the buyers on matching that completion and closing date, align with what they need to move in for whatever situation they\u2019re coming from. So keeping that buyer happy through the process, and most importantly, that day, they move in their house, they\u2019re very happy with the completed D.R. Horton home that they\u2019ve just purchased. John Lovallo : It\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Bouley : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the results and thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a question about the revenue guidance, and it\u2019s entirely possible I missed it, but just to the extent you are raising the full-year revenue guide by about, I guess, $1.7 billion at the midpoint, but delivery is up about 2,500 at the midpoint, it seems like there is a lot more revenue there than would be implied by the deliveries. Just what else is driving that uptick? Thank you. Bill Wheat : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. With the sales price increases that we have seen in recent quarters, with the sales price increase we\u2019ve seen in our net sales orders this quarter, we are anticipating a further increase in our closing average prices in Q3 and Q4 versus where we\u2019ve been in the first two quarters. So there is some expectation and visibility to increase sales prices in that revenue guide. As well, our total consolidated revenues, it does include our financial services revenues as well, and we\u2019re seeing very strong net gain performance there. And so there is probably a bit more contribution from that segment of our business into the consolidated revenue guide as well. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Second one, I wanted to ask about the administration\u2019s first time buyer plan that was laid out the other day. It\u2019s obviously much more, I guess, surgically targeted than the broad plan that was initially presented. But do you have any insight into what portion of your buyers might qualify under this down payment plan as it was laid out? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : I don\u2019t have a percentage to share with you, Matt. Honestly, we haven\u2019t spent a whole lot of time on that to date. I do think it\u2019s a narrower target than what was initially proposed. And so I don\u2019t know that we expect it to move the needle a whole lot. Honestly, the market strength today is extremely robust, and we don\u2019t really need anything to increase demand further or put more pressure on home prices, which is ultimately what more buyers, with a limited supply in the market, can drive. So we\u2019re going to continue to maintain our focus on affordability, and I\u2019m sure our mortgage company will be focused on what we need to do on that front. And we\u2019ll support those buyers as they come into our sales offices, if that is something they can take advantage of, but we don\u2019t expect that to be a big impact overall. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Understood. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to drill down a little bit on the increase of closings guidance, which I think is really noteworthy given all the concerns around the supply chain and the well publicized limitations around different parts of the supply chain, et cetera, that we\u2019ve all heard about. Maybe you can kind of walk through if there are specific efforts that you\u2019ve kind of put into place that give you the better visibility for that in the back half? And certainly also the increase in closings is much higher than the beat that you had in the second quarter itself. So, I was hoping you could kind of talk to what\u2019s driving that increased guidance? If it\u2019s perhaps some improved efficiencies in the field? If it\u2019s better supply chain arrangements or with certain key providers of either lumber or on the labor side, we would love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that? Mike Murray : Thank you, Michael. What\u2019s giving us confidence from the ability to raise our deliveries guidance has been the starts we\u2019ve been able to get out for the past two, three quarters, frankly, we\u2019ve had very strong home starts, and that\u2019s a result of our teams positioning their operating platforms to be able to have a sustained production cadence in a given neighborhood, in a given submarket. And that\u2019s allowed us to enhance our relationships with a lot of local subcontractors and labor providers in a given market. We're able to give them a consistent and plan full starts program that they can then plan their business back to. On the materials side, there certainly has been, what they\u2019ll call, a Whac-A-Mole game of trying to find the latest thing that we\u2019re out of with our purchasing scale and a lot of our national partners that we\u2019ve been working with, they\u2019ve been really good at helping us get product into homes that we need to close the homes. And those teams have deep relationships with multiple channels in their markets, able to get the components we need to complete the homes. So honestly, our build times have elongated a little bit here lately. It\u2019s not surprising, but we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made at holding the line and the confidence we have in our production process today to up our guidance for the year and deliver more homes into the strong demand we\u2019re seeing. Michael Rehaut : No, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that. I guess, secondly, you continue to do very well, obviously, with the sales pace improvements year-over-year. At the same time, you kind of mentioned that you are managing that sales pace with the mind of your capacity on starts. I believe, obviously, your order growth came in a touch below our estimate, but obviously, still extremely strong and the need to make sure sales don\u2019t go too far out, I think, is well understood. How should we think about sales pace in the back half from current quarter levels? Is it something where we should expect more of a flattish type of year-over-year prospect, just given how the business is currently being managed? Or would you see, perhaps, some further upside potential if you are able to further improve your starts capacity? Bill Wheat : Sure, Mike. Today, our starts pace and our production pace truly is leading our sales pace, and we\u2019re essentially selling based on that production schedule, as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago. Based on the visibility that we see right now, we think we can continue to expand our capacity and put ourselves in a great position to continue to grow our business into fiscal \u201822 at a double-digit pace. But that being said, the quarterly sales order pace, when you look at the sales order pace last year in Q3 and Q4, we had some very strong levels that are some very strong comps that we\u2019re up against in the back half of the year. So on our normal cadence and in positioning ourselves to grow double-digit next year, our sales order comparables year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 could be in the range of flattish, slightly up, slightly down, but that doesn\u2019t really change the positioning that we\u2019re going to be in, in terms of growing our top line and our bottom line in fiscal \u201821 and positioning ourselves for fiscal 2022. Michael Rehaut : Great. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Please proceed with your question. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lot count and how it ties to future community count. I think lot count was up, I think, 48% year-on-year. It\u2019s an enormous increase for a large company. Can you maybe talk about the cadence of how you expect your communities to grow over the next couple or three years based on that significant increase in lot? David Auld : I think we\u2019re looking at, what, low single digit community growth goal. I mean when you look at our lot count, a lot of that is option positions that are going to deliver over the next year or two years, and then last for two to three years beyond that. So at the pace these communities are running, we\u2019re looking for 600, 700 lot projects, which doesn\u2019t impact community count, but it does significantly increase lot count when it\u2019s replacing some that\u2019s half that size. So it\u2019s about scale, it\u2019s about driving consistent discipline starts. And demand right now is - it is really good. And so when Bill mentioned that our starts pace is driving our sales pace, I mean, that is the reality. If we could start more houses, we\u2019d be selling more houses. So every month with us, it\u2019s about driving production capability and expanding our start program. And if you look at week-to-week to week-to-week, it\u2019s how we manage it. Our operation - our operators out there are doing a great job. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, David. And then just drilling down back to material cost increases and to tie them to the scale that you have, whether it\u2019s local scale or national scale. If you look at conditions now, David, do you see - can you maybe talk to some specific examples, even of the leverage you\u2019ve been able to get relative to peers on costs or the acquisition of materials if there are shortages? Because it seems to me that\u2019s a - that along with the spec models a pretty important aspect to why you\u2019re continuing to grow as fast as you are despite the size of the company? Thanks. David Auld : Carl, it\u2019s a consistent discipline start program that we\u2019ve been on and managing very effectively, communicating that to our trade base. And so if they have visibility what their work process load is going to be over the next 60, 90 days. And does scale matter? Absolutely, scale matters. And I feel like every month, every - really, every day, every week, every month, our competitive position, because of our scale, because of our discipline, has just grown. And it\u2019s - we talk about sustainable. It is a great market out there, and I feel like what we\u2019re doing is we have the ability to sustain. Jessica Hansen : And Carl, in terms of material cost increases, although we have had to take some cost increases, as home prices have continued to rise and our building product partners have been experiencing cost increases in their business, we generally have price protection built in to where we have a cap on what our increase is going to be. So when you see a headline price increase for a product category, generally, what we\u2019re taking is less. It may just be protected in a form of a back-end rebate so we can protect the market price for our partners, but we are generally taking something much less than whatever the overall market increase is. Carl Reichardt : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks, everybody. David Auld : Thanks, Carl. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Carl. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks, guys. David, when you were talking about how the market was really good, I was thinking about all the people who are reading the transcript, who are not going to be able to capture - the transcript is not going to capture the emphasis there, it was a shame. I want to ask you guys about production capacity, putting community count growth aside, because everyone is very focused on that. I am focused on the potential for your absorption, you know, unit production per community to increase from here. One way is, obviously, through a mix of communities, bringing on larger communities. I think you referred to that a little bit. Or more entry level communities, which naturally have a higher level absorption. But I\u2019d also think you could increase production within each type of community, like each supervisor running a little more labor or paying overtime rates or whatever. So what I\u2019m wondering is, as you look at your absorption rates today, per community, how much room is there from here to increase either your mix of higher running communities, higher absorption communities? Or, and I should say, how much ability is there to increase your throughput within each type of community through - from here, given that your starts are up 34%, I think or so, this past quarter? David Auld : Stephen, I think there\u2019s always room to improve, and we\u2019re pushing that mentality out every day. Nothing is good enough. We got to get better. And at our operators and our culture and our company, they\u2019re all competing with each other. And so when you look at the numbers of our divisions, and you think the guy that\u2019s in the 10th or 11th slot, wants to be the number one slot, and so - but to do that, he\u2019s got to get bigger and he\u2019s got to get better. And that drives a very good result for our shareholders. And we talked about absorption as a global deal. It\u2019s really subdivision-by-subdivision, market-by-market. And our improvement in the platform and in the - what had been our smaller markets, scaling up to become big markets, has been nothing short of phenomenal. I mean, we've got great operators out there that, I think, have a lot of room to scale up, and they\u2019re positioned to do it and we\u2019ve got a market that has really derisked that effort. So I mean, I think our numbers are going to get better, Stephen. I think we\u2019ve got a lot of upside on what we\u2019re doing. And I didn't see the chart of how many markets we're number one in. But last quarter, I think it was 13. I mean, 13 out of 91. I mean, our expectation is we\u2019re going to be number one in every market. So we\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of opportunity to scale up. Bill Wheat : We hate to put a goal or trying to define what the edge of the universe could be because we\u2019d hate to limit it ourselves. I think 5 years ago, if you look back and told us we\u2019d be doing these absorptions and production capabilities, we\u2019d have been limiting to what we would have said at that time. So as David said, no matter what we\u2019re able to get done, we know we can all do a little bit better and be a little smarter about how we do things. Mike Murray : Yeah. And Stephen, obviously, in the current market with as strong as demand it is, it\u2019s a little different than we\u2019ve seen at other times in the past. It truly is. We can increase absorption if we can increase production capacity and capabilities. So our operators, our construction managers and everyone is looking for how can we continue to expand our starts pace each week, whether that\u2019s finding additional trades or helping our trades be more efficient, so they can do more homes in the same amount of time. So everybody is working to just get a little bit better. Mike Murray : And we\u2019ve consistently been growing at a double-digit pace for several years with just a low single digit community count growth. So we would continue to point you to our lot count as a driver. If we have a finished lot, we\u2019re going to start a home ultimately, and we\u2019re going to sell and close it. And so, that\u2019s really more the driver than thinking about just a community count growth expectation. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Absolutely. All right. Upward and onward. Second question relates to kind of affordability. You\u2019re probably getting a lot of questions about [Indiscernible] you know, prices are up so much. Isn\u2019t affordability being stretched? I was wondering if you could share with us whether you\u2019re seeing any signs of stress yet at the first time buyer? And then more sort of holistically, I think that prices that the homebuilders pass through inherently lags the resale market when prices are rising this fast because you all don't sell above asking price, right, whereas in the resale market, most homes are now selling above asking price. And so given the prices in the resale market are up, gosh, pretty close to 20% right now, isn\u2019t it right to think that your prices in your community should be able to rise further from here based simply on the pricing that has already been achieved in the resale market and which obviously, first time buyers are paying? So I mean I just want to - so one, can you - do you see any stress on the first time buyer market? And then two, do you agree with me that pricing for builders kind of lags a little bit inherently in this environment? Jessica Hansen : Yeah. I think we would agree with the latter that pricing may lag a little bit, but we clearly are seeing the ability to continue to push price. Our first time homebuyer percentage is actually up year-over-year, 57% compared to 53% last year, and we actually saw it tick up to the high 60s for Express. And also an improvement in terms of our first time buyer percentage just in our D.R. Horton brand. Our FICO scores stayed extremely stable as have our debt-to-income levels. So it\u2019s showing us that the buyer and the consumer is healthy today. And there are still plenty of people out there that can afford to buy a house. That being said, it's something we recognize that could ultimately become an issue. We still have an average sales price that I think is, compared to most people, about $100,000 lower than most of the rest of the public builders. So that puts us in a very strong competitive position to continue to accommodate buyers who really are looking for affordable product offerings. Stephen Kim : Excellent. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Good job. David Auld : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just a follow-up on pricing. If it\u2019s possible to generalize, are you seeing price increases among competitors as being steeper than D.R. Horton communities? If so, is it possible to quantify how much \u2013 you know, whether that\u2019s 0.5 point or 1 point? Is that continuing to kind of drive your value proposition versus customers? Or do you think that the rate of increases is maybe more in line with some of your large competitors here? Jessica Hansen : So there\u2019s a lot of variability, as I think David alluded to earlier, market-to-market, community-by-community. But even if you just listen to the other builder conference calls, which I have, generally, they\u2019re talking about higher price increases at a minimum on average versus an individual floor plan than we are in most cases. So I think we do believe that we\u2019re continuing to maintain that competitive advantage by not necessarily pushing price in some communities as much as others. In some communities, I\u2019m sure we're keeping pace with the market if the ability is there to do so. David Auld : I\u2019d disagree with Jessica. Our goal isn\u2019t to sell one house, it\u2019s to sell communities. And so we probably are not as aggressive as some of the other builders have been in raising prices. I mean, our margins are great, our returns are phenomenal, but we\u2019re in this for the long haul. And it's - we're not doing anything short term that we don\u2019t think is sustainable over time. So that\u2019s just who we are. We like being affordable. We like being the price point leader. We like competitive advantage. We think that drives more consistent, sustainable results over time, which is how we think about things. Jessica Hansen : And our lot position and our production capabilities allow us to continue to do what we\u2019re doing from an affordable product offering perspective, whereas other builders don\u2019t have as deep of a lot position as we do in many markets. And they also can\u2019t start as many homes as we can today. So there\u2019s really no need for us to push price as much as some other builders are doing. As David said, our returns have been improving, I think, at or better than the industry as a whole, even while staying affordable. Bill Wheat : We do take a long focus to all of this, and we do want to be sustainable and continue to grow our market share. We\u2019re committed to growing our market share. We\u2019re committed to returning capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in a meaningful manner. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then apologies if I missed this, but did you see any impact either from a sales side or from a cost side, from the winter storm in February in Texas and other parts of the country? I mean, from the outside, it doesn\u2019t look like it, but I am just curious what the impact was to your business? Bill Wheat : Yeah. I think there were some supply chain disruptions, some of the petrochemical plants on the Gulf Coast probably are creating some ripples. But by and large, our teams in the field did a phenomenal job of working through that, protecting the homes we had in production, as well as trying to make up the delivery days we may have lost to get those homeowners into their homes as quickly as possible. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. And congrats on the great performance. I\u2019d love to dig a little bit deeper on the price and affordability conversation. And one of the things that really struck me was, it\u2019s pretty amazing. Your average price over the last five or so years has been remarkably consistent, kind of roughly around $300,000. And prices have been going up over the time period, but you guys have obviously been able to offset that through either growing the share of Express or maybe moving a little bit further out into the tertiary submarkets. And it seems like now that, that price is clearly breaking out of the range up to 330 [ph] And I guess the question for you is, how comfortable are you - or how high are you comfortable taking that number? When you think about the lots you\u2019re acquiring today, what those costs look like? What the material costs look like? What the consumer can afford? Is there a benchmark in mind, recognizing that $300,000 seems to have been kind of the unofficial benchmark over the last five years, where that price could go before you start to get a little bit uncomfortable? Bill Wheat : Well, the $300,000 price was not the result of any top-down direct directed approach, it all happened at the subdivision level, the submarket level and the communities. And we can\u2019t make as good decisions from a centralized basis here, as our teams in the field make multiple times a day, every day of the week and responding to the market conditions, which includes what existing homes were selling for, other new home alternatives a buyer may have, as well as their cost inputs to that process. We work closely with our mortgage partners in the field to understand what the buyers are coming in with in terms of a loan qualification process and have their underwriting, and all of that factors in on a daily and a weekly basis in determining what the home is worth and can trade for at that point in time. So what we're seeing as a result of individual decisions made by people that are very experienced in the field, very close to the customers. And we\u2019re selling homes, we\u2019re delivering homes, we\u2019re originating and delivering mortgages to well qualified buyers today. So yes - and then that we\u2019re seeing the upside of that is that our aggregate average sales price has increased substantially, both in the deliveries for the quarter and in the new sales for the quarter. But it\u2019s the result of what's actually happening in the marketplace, we have so many model homes and touch points in market and communities, we\u2019re just seeing the result of that rolling up. So you\u2019re seeing a strong consumer, as Jessica mentioned before, that really wants to have a home. Alan Ratner : Understood. Got you. And then kind of related on that point because you brought up the feedback from the field, one thing that we hear a lot from builders lately is their share of buyers coming from out of state has really increased pretty dramatically since before the pandemic. I think some analysis we\u2019ve done, that share is roughly doubled from builders we talked to. So I\u2019m curious, A, if you\u2019ve looked at that or quantified the share of your business that buyers are buying from out of state versus where that was pre-COVID? And I guess on the flip side to that, if that were to slow at all, does that put any pressure on affordability, recognizing a lot of people are moving from higher tax state, higher cost states to more affordable markets? Mike Murray : We don\u2019t have anything that we\u2019ve aggregated to track that. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve heard, in my travels, David\u2019s travels, we\u2019ve heard about people relocating into the market. But we also have - when I talk to agents in the models, where your buyers coming from? They are coming from a ZIP code over or a school district over, and they\u2019re looking to get a slightly different home at a different stage in their life or their first home, they\u2019re coming out an apartment in that market. So I hear what you\u2019re saying, Alan, and I understand what a lot of the national numbers have been. We have not necessarily tracked it to give you a quantitative answer here. Jessica Hansen : And Texas and Florida continue to be our two largest states, and where I think you\u2019ve seen a lot of in migration and relocation, but that was happening before COVID. Mike Murray : Right. Jessica Hansen : So I\u2019m not sure that, you know, as a result of the pandemic easing and whatever changes from a work-from-home perspective, that, that really does anything to slow that down because we really think about that trend as haven\u2019t been pre-pandemic and those being very friendly states that generally have more affordable housing, where people have wanted to live and where a lot of businesses have relocated to so their employees can have a good cost of living and find a good quality home at the right price. David Auld : And Alan, I\u2019d say the builders that are positioned higher in the price scale, probably experienced more of that than we do. I mean ours \u2013 we\u2019re selling to people forming housing - housing formations. And I do think that a lot of that is just local market buyers, which maybe insulates us somewhat from the people moving back and forth. Alan Ratner : Got it. That makes sense. All right, guys. Thanks a lot. Good luck. David Auld : Thank you, Alan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mike Dahl : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate all the color. So far the pricing commentary, in particular on a relative basis, tracks with what we\u2019ve been seeing in our work. But I guess the important thing is it\u2019s still very healthy price increases as you\u2019ve alluded to. The question is really about implications for margins. Unless I missed it, you only gave 3Q. But conceptually, when we think about fiscal 4Q or even beyond that, when you look at maybe cost increases continuing to accelerate, but your price increase picking up and some of that flowing through to the P&L more. Would you expect 4Q to be at least similar to 3Q? Would you expect it to be higher? Any other moving pieces we should be thinking about call it two quarters or further out? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Mike. We really only have the best visibility to wonder out, which is why we\u2019ve stuck to guidance for just Q3 specifically. But clearly, market conditions remained very strong. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with our operators. As you\u2019ve heard us say, every quarter, for several quarters, our gross margins have exceeded our expectations because they\u2019ve done such a great job controlling costs. And we have been able to pushed through some price to offset some of that costs as well. I think our base case would be if market conditions remain this strong, we\u2019re hopeful that we get enough price to offset any cost increases. And is there potential upside due to continued market strength? Sure. But it\u2019s not something we can sit here and say today about our fourth quarter margins or anything further out, it\u2019s going to continue to be dependent on market strength, affordability and our ability to push through price. Mike Dahl : Okay. Got it. Thanks, Jessica. That's helpful. And then my second question is also still affordability related. Just with the rapid level of increases, I guess, both in existing home market and new home market really across price points. Are you seeing anything from an appraisal standpoint where you are starting to see appraisals lag behind the price increases that have been implemented? Just any color from the field on that? Bill Wheat : Sure. You, typically, will see in a rising price environment like we\u2019re in today, that the appraisals are often backwards looking. And it does tend to us to dampen maybe where it would go. But what you are seeing in our closed loans are homes that have been fully underwritten and appraised meeting appraisal valuations. And so we do hear about it anecdotally. There is oftentimes more education you can provide in that process and more information you can make available that can help with the appraisal process, but it\u2019s not been a significant impediment to the prices that we\u2019re contracting for homes are closing at those prices generally. Mike Dahl : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Truman Patterson : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I just wanted to talk a little bit more on the cost increases, especially lumber. Lumber is just really starting to spike here over the past month or so. And I appreciate that, literally, every day, the futures are a moving target. But could you give us a big picture macro overview? Do you think that there\u2019s any relief in sight going forward? Any new sawmills opening? There is a lot of robust demand or do you think this level of lumber pricing is kind of here to stay? And with that I wanted to follow up on Mike Dahl's question. Do you think there\u2019s enough pricing in the industry to really offset this lumber inflation especially that will probably hit kind of calendar 4Q? David Auld : You know, is the lower pricing here to stay? I think a lot of it was driven by mills shutting down during COVID. I do think as they reopen these mills and increase the capacity to deliver wood, you\u2019re going to see some improvement, some - a little less pressure on it. I think opening up international trade may relieve some pressure on it. But right now, to date, the demand is so strong. A lot of people, over the last so many years, deferred buying a house. Now the house has been formed [ph] and the kids are coming, and COVID showed that you know, living in an apartment down, metropolitan area may not be the lifestyle you want, so a lot of factors driving demand. I don't know if I answered your question, but it's complicated. Jessica Hansen : We continue to have a focus on efficiency. And regardless of what\u2019s going on in the cost environment, we\u2019re trying to become more efficient every day, and we want to be able to put an affordable house on the ground regardless of our input costs. And I think we've proven that our operators and our scale are allowing us to do that kind of regardless of lumber fluctuations here over the last couple of years. And we\u2019ll see where it's headed. But we adjust to that as necessary and do the best we can to manage those lumber costs as they come through. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. And then another one, just on affordability and pricing, I mean, very robust pricing so far this year, especially on a year-over-year basis. And I know a lot of entry level builders really try to stay below the FHA loan limits within the specific metro. But could you just generally talk about how much wiggle room you have to possibly push pricing going forward before really bumping up against those loan limits appreciating that you\u2019re probably attempting to continue to switch to a smaller square footage? Mike Murray : Yeah, I think Truman that we\u2019re continually looking to make sure we\u2019re affordable to the markets that we serve on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. And we\u2019re seeing that today that we\u2019re not getting any resistance to the pricing that\u2019s coming through. You can just see that by the level of specs that we have. I think 26% of our homes in inventory are unsold today, and probably most of those are fairly recently started. It may not even have been released for sale yet, as we\u2019re working our way through the production process. But as we see sign off softening demand would be an increase in our completed specs. And right now, those are down, I think, about 700 homes that are completed and unsold today, which is, you know, we probably haven\u2019t been that low since 1992, the time we become public. David Auld : That's usually the number at Dallas. Mike Murray : Yeah, usually, in a given market, we may have that many, by intention. And so we are - we see very strong demand, and we\u2019re not seeing any resistance yet on the affordability side. Because as we\u2019ve talked about before, we do try to position ourselves as an affordable value choice against the competitive set we have in any even neighborhood versus other new homes and the compelling buy against existing homes. Truman Patterson : Asked another way, are you all comfortable going above the FHA loan limits today, just given how strong demand is? David Auld : In some markets, we are. It just adds a risk level to the underwriting\u2026 Truman Patterson : Okay. David Auld : That's one of the things we look at on every project we put under contract. It\u2019s how that stacks against FHA. And if it\u2019s over FHA, it adds to the risks. But are we comfortable doing it? Yes. It depends \u2013 it\u2019s all project-driven, market-driven. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you. Good luck on the upcoming quarter. David Auld : Thank you. Bill Wheat : Thank you, Truman. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. Jay McCanless : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question I had, you talked about cycle times moving up a little bit. Could you talk about where they are now versus last year? Mike Murray : They\u2019re probably about two to three weeks longer on the build process. What we have seen though, on the flip side of that, is historically with our spec production model, that we would have a period of time from when the home is completed until it\u2019s finally closed - it's sold and closed. With the sales and deliveries we\u2019ve had of our completed unsold homes over the past year, our time from completion of the home to deliver to the customer has greatly shortened. And so we\u2019ve maintained a lot of capital efficiency and great inventory turns in that process. But we have seen an elongation of our build times. Jay McCanless : Okay. Got it. And then the other question I had, when you think about the getting more starts out there, getting the land entitled, I mean, is the pinch point right now on the labor side that you don\u2019t have enough people to pour foundations, et cetera? Or are you still having to deal with some headwinds on the municipal side to get the lots entitled, et cetera? What\u2019s - I guess what\u2019s the bigger issue right now on a national basis? Mike Murray : I don\u2019t know that you could point to any one issue. It\u2019s all a challenge in the execution of the business, and that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what our job is, is to get out there every day, identify sites that are going to make great neighborhoods, work with local municipalities and land sellers, third party developers to get the entitlements in place. Generally, anecdotally, it takes longer than it used to. And people, in some markets will complain, and then you\u2019ll share a story about a market, maybe one of the coastal markets and how many years it takes to get through something, and then they\u2019re like, wow, this is pretty good here. And then in terms of production capability, we have focused on expanding our production capability through a sustained disciplined starts program that lets us share that information with our subcontractor partners that they\u2019re able to be plan full in their business and allocate the resources to it. They really appreciate working with us and that it\u2019s they can be - they know what\u2019s coming at them and what the expectations are. And so simplifying our product, simplifying our starts processes has been a big win for us in grabbing more production capacity in the markets and then hanging on to it by keeping the lots coming, so we can keep starting the houses. Jay McCanless : Sounds great. Thanks again for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Jay. Mike Murray : Thanks, Jay. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Auld for final comments. David Auld : Thank you, Melissa. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your continued focus and hard work. And I\u2019m going to remind you again, stay humble, stay hungry and stay - and let's close out this year in an unbelievable fashion. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Darrell and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q, early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentation section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray , our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Bill wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The DR work team delivered an outstanding third quarter highlighted by a 78% increase in earnings to $3.06 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 81% on a 35% increase in revenues to $7.3 billion and our pretax profit margin improved 490 basis points, and 19.4%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 34.9% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 29.5%. These results reflect our experience team's new production capabilities, our ability to leverage the award and scale across our broad geographic footprint and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Housing market conditions remain very robust. And we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, multiple disruptions in the supply chain combined with the improvement in economic conditions, and strong demand for new homes have resulted in shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market, which has caused our construction time to become less predictable. As our top priority is to consistently fulfill our commitments to our homebuyers, we have slowed our home sales pace to more closely align our current production levels and our selling homes later in the construction cycle when we can better ensure the certainty of home close date for our homebuyers. We expect to work through these issues and increase our production capacity. We started construction on 22,600 homes this quarter, and our homes in inventory increased 44% from a year ago to 47,300 homes at June 30, 2021, positioning us to finish 2021 strong and to achieve double digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and a low leverage positioned us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our home building operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize the return on our inventory investments. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 78% to $3.06 per diluted share, compared to $1.72 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 77% to $1.1 billion compared to $630.7 million. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 35% to $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed, up from $5.2 billion on 17,642 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $326,100 and the average size of our homes closed was down 2%. Bill? Bill Wheat : The value of our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 2% from the prior year to $6.4 billion, while our net sales orders for the quarter decreased 17% to 17,952 homes. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the third quarter was $359,200. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 17%, down from 22% in the prior year quarter. As David described in this very strong demand environment, our local teams are restricting the sales over pace in each of their communities based on the number of homes in inventory, construction time and lot position. They continue to adjust sales paces and prices to market on a community by community basis, while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. Based on the stage of completion of our current homes and inventory, production schedules and capacity, we expect to continue restricting the pace of our sales orders during our fourth fiscal quarter. As a result, we expect our fourth quarter net sales orders to be lower than the third quarter. However, we are confident that we will be well positioned to deliver double digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 32,200 homes in backlog, 47,300 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the third quarter was 25.9%, up 130 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The increase in our gross margin from March to June exceeded our expectations and reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4.7% sequentially, while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 3.5%. And our lot costs increased 1.7%. We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase on a per square foot basis. However, with the strength in today's market conditions; we expect to offset any cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the third quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pace in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the third quarter homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, down 80 basis points from 7.9% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is lower than any quarter in our history. And we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David? David Auld : We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand and we expect the current constraints on our supply chain to ultimately subside. This quarter, we started 22,600 homes, up 33% from the third quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12 months starts to 94,500 homes. We ended this quarter with 47,300 homes in inventory, up 44% from a year ago; 15,400 of our total homes at June 30th were unsold, of which 500 were complete. Mike? Mike Murray : At June 30th, our home building lot position consisted of approximately 517,000 lots, which 24% were owned, and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 25% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 44% of our control lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and also supports our efforts to increase our production volume to meet homebuyer demand. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land in development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $910 million was for finished lots; $540 million was for land development, and $350 million was to acquire land. $300 million of our total lot purchases in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar, our majority owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well capitalized residential lot manufacturer operating in 55 markets across 22 states. Forestar is delivering on its high growth expectations and now expects to grow its fiscal 2021 lot deliveries by approximately 50% year-over- year to a range of 15,500 to 16,000 lots, with a pre ax profit margin of 11.5% to 12%, excluding their $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt recognized during the quarter. At June 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot opposition increased 91% from a year ago to 96,600 lots, 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D. R. Horton are subject to a right of first offer and our master supply agreement. Forestar's separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $470 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 37.8%. With a strong lot supply, capitalization and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Financial Services pretax income in the third quarter was $70.3 million, with the pretax profit margin of 37.3% compared to $68.8 million and 43.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in our financial services pretax profit margin was primarily due to lower net gains on loans originated this quarter caused by market fluctuations and increased competitive pricing pressure in the market. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage companies' loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage companies' volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 58% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : At June 30th, our multifamily rental operations had 11 projects under active construction in an additional four projects that are completed and in a lease up phase, based on leased occupancy and our marketing process. We expect to sell two or three of these projects during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Our multifamily rental assets sold $458.3 million at June 30. Last year, we began constructing and leasing homes as income producing single family rental communities. After these rental communities are constructed and achieve a stabilized level of least occupancy. Each community is marketed for sale. During the third quarter, we sold our second single family rental community for $23.1 million in revenue, and $11.4 million of gross profit. At June 30, our homebuilding inventory included $303.1 million of assets related to 44 single family rental communities, compared to $87.2 million of assets related to 10 communities at the beginning of the fiscal year. We are pleased with the performance of our single and multifamily rental teams, and we look forward to the growing contributions for our future profits and returns. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balance capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the nine months into June our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $276 million, even while we have reinvested significant operating capital to expand our homebuilding inventories in response to strong demand. At June 30, we had $3.7 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.7 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the increased scale and activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 16% at the end of June, with $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At June 30, our stockholders equity was $13.8 billion, and book value per share was $38.54, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months into June, our return on equity was 29.5% compared to 19.9%, a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $72.1 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $241.2 million during the quarter for a total of 8.1 million shares repurchase fiscal year-to-date for $661.4 million. Our remaining share repurchase authorization in June 30 was $758.8 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 based on today's market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion to $8.4 billion and our homes close to be in the range between 23,000 and 24,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 26% to 26.3% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be approximately 7%. We anticipate our financial services pretax profit margin in the range of 40% to 45%. And we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5%. For the full fiscal year of 2021, we now expect consolidated revenues of $27.6 billion to $28.1 billion and to close between 83,000 and 84,500 homes. This year, we have prioritized reinvestment of our operating capital to increase our housing and land and lot inventories to support higher demand. Our other cash flow priorities remain balanced. Among increasing our investment in our multi and single family rental platforms, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying a dividend and repurchasing shares to reduce our outstanding share counts by approximately 2% from the beginning of fiscal 2021. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect our experience teams and production capabilities. Industry leading market share, raw geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our results also illustrate the growth opportunity in front of us as we increase production capacity in response to homebuyer demand. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with a significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. As a result of these efforts, we are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is come from the line of Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. StephenKim: Yes, thanks very much guys, impressive results. And really interesting times here, I wanted to talk a little bit about this restriction of sales which we've been seeing you and others do. Throughout the June quarter, you indicated you expected that to continue in the September quarter. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around that. Are you expecting the restrictions to be similar in severity in the September quarter? Do you think those restrictions might continue past September to a meaningful degree. And I guess it's really related to your starts. And so in that regard, your starts were down I think 5% sequentially or so was curious when you thought that could grow. And you talked about building the infrastructure needed to do higher level of housing starts, I wondered to see if you could provide a little more color around that. So more color on the starts outlook. And are you going to be continuing to restrict sales at the same degree in September, and maybe past September? DavidAuld: Well, on the starts outlook, we have a plan. And our plan is to consistently be out there community by community, increasing production over time. If you look at our quarterly run rate, we're in that 20,000 to 23,000 starts each quarter. That was the plan for this year. Our plan is to take that out next year. And we position land, lots people to affect that plan. So demand out there is just unlike anything I've ever seen. And I think our focus is on how to meet that demand in the most efficient manner. And injecting a homeowner into the process sooner rather than later, impacts the our ability to get the house and built an extent that time and it makes it harder for our trades and our superintendent, I can tell you is through our history, to have somebody walk into our models and to tell them we don't have a house for you to buy today is something that is foreign to us and as difficult as anything I've ever seen on sales people. It is a tough environment to be in a sales office today. And I talk -- in our travels, I talk to our people we're going to provide a home for everybody walking in. We just need to keep on patient and understand their frustration. But that's just again; it's a market I've never seen. Demand is just unbelievable today. I can't remember the rest of the question. StephenKim: Largely, they were to look ahead, and the restrictions, are they likely to continue to the same degree in the September quarter? And will they -- you anticipate continue past September? DavidAuld: We are continuing to put things in place to expand our production capability, we've increased the pay size of our lot deliveries, because we see, in my history, if a buyer walked into a model, and you hadn't figured out how to get them under contract, in a week, 10 days, they had bought somewhere else. I got an email this month, from a buyer who has been in our models at every release for the last year and hasn't been able to buy a house. And he's still waiting. I mean, you can multiply that 1000s and 1000s of times across the country, with multiple builders out there. We did not restrict sales, as soon as the general market did, and which just geometrically increased our demand. And it's just -- it again, we're all managing through a market that none of us have ever seen. And probably the difference in this cycle, than the prior super demand cycle that I was a part of, is the builders are disciplined this cycle. We're all focused on capital efficiency; we're all focused on improving returns. And it's, I think it's going to expand the cycle again. And, again, we're in un-chartered waters from a demand aspect right now. JessicaHansen: And Steve, in terms of just specifically restricting sales, those decisions are going to continue to be made on a community by community basis. So where we can get the start accelerated is where we'll open up for more sales more quickly. MikeMurray: Where we can get the starts accelerated as well as getting better certainty to production timelines. The worst thing we want to do is put a homeowner -- homebuyer into the backlog, and then not be able to deliver our commitment to them as to when their home's going to be ready. It's very disruptive. We want them to have a great experience and be very happy with their house when they move into it. So as we've worked through a lot of the supply chain disruptions, we've adopted some of our processes, sharing more information earlier in the process with our trade partners, helping us with longer lead times, that's helping to work through some of the supply chain issues. We're hopeful that those things are resolving as we work them through but for the fourth quarter, I can foresee us continuing to restrict sales, again, the decision made community by community based upon current local conditions. But those restrictions will likely remain in place in the fourth quarter. StephenKim: Okay, appreciate that. Your order ASP was remarkably up about 10% sequentially from the March quarter, I was wondering how much of that increase in order ASP was actual price, do you think versus mix shift? And as you look in at that order, ASP flowing into your gross margin in the next quarter or two? I was curious if you could help us understand what kind of lumber cost cadence we should be thinking about. Obviously, it's gyrated quite a bit here over the year past year so if you could give us a sense for was this quarter absorbing peak lumber cost? Or is it next quarter just help us understand how the lumber cost cadence fits in as well as the mix shift effect in your order ASP. MikeMurray: Steve, I'll take that, the lumber cost. I don't think we saw peak lumber costs coming through in our June quarter closings. I'm expecting to your word gyrating was a good word for the lumber market, seeing the higher lumber costs coming through in our September quarter deliveries and early into our fourth quarter deliveries and I'm very confident that the order price trends that we've seen have more than offset that lumber cost. And we've been able to absorb that well, into margins that we'll see in our fourth quarter deliveries. JessicaHansen: Yes, and in terms of mix, Steve, I mean, our sales orders are a good indicator of our forward closing price. But it doesn't typically flow through directly like that. So we wouldn't expect our closing price next quarter to be at the same magnitude or equivalent to our sales orders. But we haven't seen a whole lot of mix. So I mean, we are seeing and you can see it flowing through on our closings in our gross margin, a lot of like for like price improvement. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Carl Reichardt with BTIG. CarlReichardt: Thanks, good morning, everybody. In the release, you've mentioned that you're building out infrastructure to support the higher level of housing starts going forward. And can you expand on that a little bit, David? So are there incremental costs? What specifically are you referring to there? And when is your expectation that such infrastructure will be in place to support those starts level? And I guess really, what I'm asking is, how much of this is really in your control, versus the demand side of supply chain side that isn't? DavidAuld: I think what we can control, we are controlling, Carl, we can control the number of lots that we push into the pace; we can control communication with our trade partners, and make sure they understand the levels and timing of what we're pushing out. In our staffing levels generally that's been the least of the problems, because it's absorption for community. So you have to add support and communities. But it's just a very efficient process. So it really just has to do with field operations, as far as driving that capacity and aggregating and consolidating trade base within those sub markets, which is a process that we go through every day. I mean, we did start almost 95,000 homes, in trailing 12 months. And that's I don't think anybody else has ever done that. And it's a result of scale, and just incredibly hard work being done out in the field. CarlReichardt: Thanks David. And then, in the past, and this cycle too, we've seen builders use sales price to try to put a brake on turnover rates. And I think there's some concerns in the market, which I share that pricing dynamic may be beginning to negatively impact sales rates. I'm curious if that's something you felt that you saw, you said a lot of positive things about demand, and whether or not now, the restriction on sales, it looks like are far more important to you to manage absorption pace, and then pricing is. And I also know that's made -- that decision is made at a local level. So can you sort of help untangle that for me that we really not using price and just using price to cover costs and because demand is good, or you still feel like you're using prices and break on sale? DavidAuld: I think today we're seeing very little price pushback. It's -- I don't know that you could ever know that you could impact demand the price today. So, go ahead. MikeMurray: Our restriction on sales is not being driven by and large buy, just let's just increase pricing until people stop buying. We are not releasing homes for sale until we're through a certain stage in the production process, which varies by community. But it's not just using price to adjust the pace that we're going. We're actually not releasing the homes for sale. When the homes do get released for sale, we're seeing very quick absorption of those particular homes by buyers that are waiting to buy homes and to go under contract and then take delivery of the homes. JessicaHansen: Still very focused on affordability, Carl, even with increases in our ASP is still significantly lower than the rest of the public builders by and large. And that's a focus that we don't want to lose. We do want to maintain affordability and we've seen the credit profile of our buyers continue to keep pace with where ASPs have gone and so really even when we do stress tests on our backlog, it looks like our buyers are in very good shape even in spite of the price increases we've seen in the market. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Deepak Raghav with Wells Fargo Securities. DeepakRaghav: Hi, good morning all. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk through some of the early outlooks on pricing and margin into 2022? If you're able to, it feels like you should get good leverage from your double digit revenue growth outlook. And hopefully commodities may moderate into that -- into 2022. Early just given that you're all -- all the builders are pacing sales here, giving the breathing time for supply chain to catch up. And you may not feel compelled to give all that benefits back. So should we think about flat to up gross margins? Or would they still be pressures to gross margin from a tough 2021 comp? MikeMurray: Sure, thanks. Thanks, Deepak. We have commented and guided to a slightly off gross margin into our Q4, and to our September quarter of 26% to 26.3%. And based on what we can see today in our backlog with the pricing that has already been taken in our sales orders over the last quarter or two, we believe we're in position certainly to maintain or slightly see increases in our gross margin over the next quarter or two in excess of the cost increases that we're seeing come through. So in the short run, the next quarter or two, we do expect stability or maybe a slight upside to our current gross margin. Obviously, beyond that, we don't have as much visibility, but clearly, we feel like we have good stability in our margins for the near term. DeepakRaghav: Okay, that's fair. You also mentioned some new or incremental supply chain constraints in the quarter. Can you please elaborate on those? And also as we talk about the supply chain, racquetball constraints, any new ones that cropped up in the prior quarter -- in the quarter, one? And two, have you seen any easing on the flip side, as well? MikeMurray: So on the supply chain, if anything was construed as there were new constraints, I don't want to imply that there were any new constraints. I think we referenced last quarter that the supply chain challenges have been a bit of a whack a mole, and that one pops up and the teams jump on it, and work with the suppliers in that particular category to solve those issues. One of the things we have done is adjusted internally with a lot of our lead time, how far in advance of actual production start that we're communicating with the supply chain partners to make sure that product is available for us. But I could not point to any one particular item as new or incredibly acute right now. There's just a series of issues that we solve every day in the business. That's part of what we do. It's how we've delivered over 20,000 homes this last quarter. Operator : Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. MichaelRehaut: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I want to get a better sense a little bit of the approach to orders relative to production pace and supply constraints. And obviously a bit of discussion here already on the call. But what I'm a little confused on is you'd said that your starts pace is kind of tracking to plan at 22,000 to 23,000. You just said that. Also, there are no really new constraints out there more ongoing supply constraints, yet your orders are down 17%. And that's in contrast to prior commentary of flat to down single digits. So just wanted to understand what really has been the difference in approach and if there's something that really changed during the quarter that's driving that different result on the order side, relative to your prior commentary? BillWheat: Well, Mike, I think what we have seen is an elongation of our construction times beyond what we were seeing previously so which is really a cumulative effect of a number of things that have been ongoing that are impacting supply chain, which are manifesting themselves in longer construction times. And so as we're managing that and trying to manage the customer experience as best we can that has resulted in us releasing sales in more communities later in the construction cycle than we were previously. So it's been a, I would say, an incremental restriction of sales, that's resulted in probably a bit more of a sales order restriction than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. But it's something that's as we work through the supply chain issues and start to have better visibility and get more of our production later in the construction cycle and essentially catch up a bit on production, and we'll be able to probably resume at a better pace on sales orders. MikeMurray: A goal means to have our customers in backlog for a shorter period of time, the time from when they sign the contract, we deliver the home, we're consciously trying to compress that timeframe, to give them more certainty in the process, and give us more control of when we deliver the home to them. DavidAuld: When you move release date on a particular house, from slab to frame to windows install, I mean that is an extended period of time right now. And so reading demand, or any significant change in this quarter adjustment, as we have pushed out that release date, to me is just not indicative of what is out there in the market. We really are trying to improve the experience of the homebuyer. And when we give somebody a date to close, we intend to keep because their whole life revolves around them. And as the certainty close date was impacted by windows insulation, anything and everything that appliances that was taking place through the last six months, it just became obvious to us that we need to be more restricted in what we've done, trust me. It is soul crushing to ourselves people to have somebody walk out and ready willing able to buy. And we tell that we have houses that will become available in 30 to 45 days. And we'll be glad to call you, what is different to me this market cycle than any other than I've ever been a part of. Is it 30 or 45 days later, you call that person and yes, they're still trying to buy a house. So it's a tough market -- environment. MichaelRehaut: Right, no, I appreciate those comments, David, and obviously not disappointing your customers is a key part of it. Second question, I just wanted to circle back a little bit to the order ASP essentially around 360, up over -- 22%, up 22% year-over-year, the backlog up over 13% year-over-year. It stands obviously in stark contrast to 2018 through 2020, where you also had periods of home price appreciation, not anywhere near the same level. But you were able to maintain that average closing price right around 300 for three straight years. So the question is what are you doing going forward to, I understand that obviously, you have a price that's maybe below most of your peers, but still that monthly payment has been something that you guys pride yourselves on. Is there any action that you can take over the next year or two to perhaps reverse that trend, either through building slightly further out or maybe slightly different footprints or more attached products, whatever it might be, to perhaps reverse that trend, particularly to the extent that rates might rise? The real concerns here in the marketplace, is that the current price maybe it's okay in the current backdrop but might be more vulnerable in the next year or two. So anything that you're doing in terms of your product mix your geographic mix that might help solves those issues. DavidAuld: Well, we have decreased our square footage and you will probably continue to see that take place. We are reducing the number of two storey homes that we offer in communities. I mean my offer I mean, we have a production model, we're detailing or we're picking the houses we're going to build and the lay schedule that we're going set up with the market with. So it again, we are very sensitive to price point, we are very sensitive to the FHA loan limits. That to us is a risk mitigator, because that's where the vast majority of buyers are. And if we service so, I trust my core, we're monitoring, and we're tracking it. And we do believe that as our production capabilities continue to improve, and increase, and we consolidate labor and in these markets that we will continue to be able to offer affordable homes. If rates tick up and yes, more pressure on price. But we will meet that challenge when it comes. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Matthew Bouley with Barclays. MatthewBouley: Good Morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess not to belabor the point, but just back on the restricting of sales pace. Because it seems like it was affected to really similar degree consistently across your markets, despite these local community by community decisions. So can you sort of go over the mechanics, I guess, of how you all Horton management really communicates the strategy to, I believe you said earlier, these sort of frustrated individual operators and sales folks, what are you telling people to look for in terms of, like you said, homes and inventory and extended cycle times today versus ideally where you want them to be, in order to begin releasing those sales again, thank you. DavidAuld: I think what we're looking for is to get a level of inventory in front of the buyers, typically, this time of year, we'd be sitting on 40%- 45% specs, the day, the only specs, we have are at our houses, we haven't released to the market. So again, it's -- we're trying to grab efficiency in the process. And by controlling when that house is sold, it does help both meet customer expectation, and it also eliminates a lot of frustration on the building side where a buyer is coming out. And they have been told; maybe they bought a house in January. And they've been told they will be moving into June and the house is ready to move into. So they're out there every day, monitoring the progress of their house against the progress of every other home in the community. And it just adds the level of difficulty that to be honest with you right now today. We don't want and we don't need it. Somebody gets frustrated in the middle process; they stay frustrated for a very long time very hard to meet the expectation once they get upset. So by limiting that by pushing the maturity of our inventory further down the process before we inject a buyer into it. We're trying to take some of the pressure off our trades and our builders. And what does that process take place? I will tell you, in some divisions, it started in January, and then it would other divisions in February. And really by April in April, 1st of May it took hold in some of our very large divisions in the state of Texas and it just got to the point where we were spending more time on it or we were spending a significant amount of time dealing with the customers frustration on this closed state of their house at the expense of other things we could be doing that would drive future efficiency and production capability. So again it's -- it was a process that took place over multiple months, beginning in one division and ending really ending in Texas.  So Don Horton said many times, never thought he'd see a day when he couldn't build every house he could sell in the state of Texas. I can tell you today there are not enough lots or trade capacity to meet demand in the state of Texas; I don't care if you're Don Horton, or any of the other public builders out there. It's very difficult to get a house build today. We're doing a better job than anybody else. And we're going to get better at what we're doing. But it's -- there is a tremendous amount of demand out there. MatthewBouley: No, that's really helpful color there. And it's actually segue into my follow up, which is when you talk about how strong demand is, and exceeding your current capacity, and you're clear around your own restrictions. What are you looking at in your communities that quantifiably, I guess that gives you the confidence to say that, and in fairness when you look at the, I guess traffic, perhaps in your communities, are you also seeing traffic slip more than you might expect, seasonally? And was that part of the shortfall in orders? Or is it really just simply what you previously said that demand is just far exceeding capacity. MikeMurray: Matt, we can look across and see the stage of construction our unsold homes are at, and by and large, they are at early stages of construction, and likely not available or released for sale. So and we're not writing sales contracts, by and large for pre sales, breathing, we haven't started yet and generally reaching a more mature stage of construction. So we can deliver with certainty, a closing date to that buyer at the time we signed the contract with them. JessicaHansen: And so many of our communities have wait lists or interest lists that far exceed even what we have under construction, which is why you continue to hear us answer every single question so far, that the demand is still there. And the demand is extremely robust. And this was an internal decision that was based on our production capacity and taking care of our homeowners and homebuyers. Operator : Our next questions come from the line of Alan Ratner with Zelman and Associates. AlanRatner: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So first question, Jessica, you made a comment earlier that I'd love to drill in on a little bit in regards to the credit profile of your buyers, I think obviously a lot of questions on the home price increases and what impact that could have on affordability, you said you've seen the credit profile of your buyers keeping pace with the home price increases, you've instituted up to this point, which I was a little surprised at just given the fact we know incomes are not up 20% year-over-year, and rates are pretty stable now after obviously going down quite a bit in the second half of last year. So should I interpret that to imply that maybe the mix of your buyers or the buyers in your interest list are kind of slowly shifting maybe towards more of a move up buyer or at least a more affluent first time buyer than you've historically seen over the last few years. JessicaHansen: We really haven't seen a change in our mix across our brands, which would be our best indicator as an entry level versus move up. And really, even if we look at the credit profile across all of our brands, we really saw, we've seen this year an improvement in FIFO score, a slight reduction in debt to income, even with a higher average loan amount as a result of the higher average sales prices that we're experiencing. So no, I don't -- I wouldn't attribute it to that. I mean, we still have almost 55% to 60% of our buyers are first time buyers. MikeMurray: A very large number of unsatisfied buyers out there, people that want to buy a home that have not been able to buy a home because they could not get a home. And we look at the existing home inventory levels that are available and given marketplaces. They're just not there. And so the quick moving homes, the specs we had that were completed last year, obviously they were absorbed very quickly into the marketplace, we've restricted the sale of a lot of our homes, to give better certainty to that homebuyer in the process of their delivery date. And with in a rising price environment when we're restricting the sale, they were able to price to market at the time we signed the contract, which is then closer to the delivery date. AlanRatner: Got it. Okay. And I appreciate that extra color there. So I guess the follow up to that point then is obviously it's an incredibly tight supply environment today. You guys are holding back sales, restricting sales. A lot of other builders are kind of doing or saying the same thing. So it would seem like if you kind of connect the dots here, a lot of homes are being started today. Not a lot of those homes yet are released for sale. So at some point in the future, you would think inventory is going to come to the market in a pretty meaningful way and the question then, of course is will the demand be sufficient to absorb that? Because right now it's probably a little tricky to get a firm grasp on what that demand is when you're turning buyers away. So are you tracking that on your kind of a local basis what other builders are doing in terms of restricting sales with starting homes? And how would you anticipate responding if let's just say later this year, or in your fiscal 1Q you start releasing more homes for sale, other builders do the same thing. And the demand is not quite what you expected it to be? Are you willing to accept a lower absorption pace? Are you going to start at that point to maybe discount a little bit? What would the thought process be? JessicaHansen: It's going to be a different answer community by community. And usually, our first read Alan is on the existing home side. So our local guys are very in tune with what's going on with both existing home inventory and other public builders in their market. And as always we can adjust our search schedule up or down based on market conditions. So if what you're saying were to come true, and there start to be signs of some sort of increased supply in the market, that the demand is not going to be there for which right now feels like we are a long ways away from, we would be able to adjust our starts accordingly community by community where we saw those signs, like we always do to make sure we don't end up with an excess supply of completed specs. But with 500 completed homes across the country today, we're just so far from having that conversation on a national level. But those are things that our local operators certainly pay attention to, all the time when they're looking at their business plan and what they're going to do going forward, our plan would be to continue to consolidate market share, regardless of market conditions. And we believe we're going to continue to be the best position to do that, kind of regardless of what the demand profile looks like in future periods. DavidAuld: And again, so we're focused on the lower end of the price scale. And I can assure you if we -- even if we look at the other public builders out there, their price points are higher, and any slowdown in the market, at least in my opinion, is going to be driven by the house payment. And it does not feel like that is anything on horizon right now. MikeMurray: I don't think if you look at what we have available for sale today, what we've started and what we plan to start, I don't believe that's going to satisfy the demand that we're seeing in our sales offices today. And I don't believe any of the other builders have near the amount of inventory coming at them and starts coming at them that we do. So I just don't see that in the new home builders being able to push a lot of inventory into the marketplace available for sale in any kind of a short to medium term horizon, that's going to dent significantly this demand. That's why Jessica said, we watch at a local level what's happening in the existing home market. AlanRatner: That's very helpful. I appreciate the thought process there. And it'll be interesting to see over the next few quarters. Can I sneak in one last one? David, you mentioned obviously, many times this is unlike anything you've seen in terms of having to turn buyers away. When I look at your business and obviously the one big thing that's changed in terms of your strategy now versus prior cycles is on the land strategy. You own a lot fewer lots or a much smaller supply of land on a year supply basis than you have in the past. And you're more reliant on third party developers through option contracts, et cetera. So I'm curious what you're seeing from the developers or are they facing outsize pressure on their development timelines vis-\u00e0-vis perhaps what you're seeing on your own portfolio? And is that in any way, slowing the process down? It's not just you; obviously, the whole industry is shifting more towards that strategy. But I'm curious, with a smaller supply of own land, does that inhibit your ability to grow perhaps more than it had in the past? DavidAuld: These third party developers are our trade partners of ours. I mean, we work with these guys' day in and day out. We've been working with them day in day out for multiple years now. We know these guys, we know their capabilities. And if one of them gets in trouble. I mean, we step in and help. And we've done that a couple of times this year, where a local guy got out over skis, and we had to step in and bring the lots to market and that's, so it's -- we talked about the flexibility of our capital structure on our balance sheet and liquidity that we maintain. That's why we do this. And then we got the added benefit of a very close relationship with Forestar, who has been, they have done an exceptional job of building out their platform over the last five years. And they have really good people controlling the operations and developments of these lots and we are their biggest customer. And so we, I was thinking about that this morning, when you look at the embedded lot counts that we own and control and our ability to actually have a production plan to drive a set number of starts every week in every market on a consistent and growing basis. That is just in today's world that is an incredible competitive advantage. And it allows us to communicate with our trades. So that they know what we're going to start. Our, the vast majority of our key trade partners know our start base in October, November, December, and January. And that's when we're going to start down. And they are aligned with our vision of what we're trying to accomplish. And, I mean, they spent a lot of work into this position. But there's never been a platform in this industry that has anything like what D.R. Horton platform is today. And we're very proud of that. And we'd like we're going to deliver outstanding results as a result of it. JessicaHansen: And just for reference our control lot position. So in addition to what we own is up 78% from a year ago, so we have got the lots in front of us and feel very comfortable about our lot position not being the hindrance to our ability to grow. It's actually what supported us being able to grow like we have, and to continue to do so in the future. AlanRatner: I appreciate that, guys. And just to clarify, I wasn't implying you don't control the lots, it was more there are lots developed. DavidAuld: That's a valid concern is something that we monitor, and whether we own a lot, or we're buying an option. We have people in other divisions working with on every community to make sure those lots get delivered. Operator : Our next question is come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. AnthonyPettinari: Good morning. Last year, the pandemic kind of threw seasonality out the window, as you look at home buyer behavior in terms of underlying demand. Are you seeing any return of seasonality? Or should we expect another year of people looking to buy homes the week of Thanksgiving, the week of Christmas? And then your cancellation rate, I think extremely low by historical standards. But I think it ticked up very modestly sequentially in the quarter. Was there anything behind that? It sounds like price wasn't an issue. But just wondering if there was anything you saw there that just kind of noise? JessicaHansen: Nothing on -- nothing to point out on the cancellation rate. I mean, that's still at a historical low. Typically, we're very comfortable and are normalized ranges in the low 20s versus the 17 I think that we mentioned today, so it's the nothing of note there. To the first question, seasonality, yes. DavidAuld: Again, if we -- if -- I don't know how you define seasonality that is based upon the number of houses you start, and when you release them for sale. We're building that process program to improve that, I think you're going to see our sales track our inventory of releases. And as we release more houses from selling houses. MikeMurray: And sales historically has been a very good indicator of demand in the marketplace, as we've had a broad range of homes in various production stages available for sale and pre sales available. And that would be a good indicator of demand in the marketplace. Today, it's our supply of homes, is indicating what we're going to be able to sell and deliver and with almost 50,000 homes in production. And the starts we've had over the past 12 months. We're in a great place to continue to deliver double digit growth in our deliveries. We feel really good about fiscal '22. AnthonyPettinari: Great. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, I mean, I think in the past, you've talked about community count, rising low single digits as you pivot to selling homes a little bit later. Is there any change to that estimate or its impact? MikeMurray: Our goal as we focus on gaining market share, consolidate market share we would expect over the longer term our community account to continue to grow, obviously today with the strong demand, but there's some communities where we have sold out sooner and so you see some quarterly fluctuation in that. But over the longer term, we'd expect the trend to be for community accounts to continue to grow at a modest pace at a low to mid single digit pace over the longer term. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. TrumanPatterson: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question on you alluded in your press release about double digit unit growth in 2022. And my question doesn't really pertain to demand or the demand outlook, really, but I'm just hoping to understand, what are some of the biggest risks to achieving that growth on the supply side? We've heard issues with lot development availability, community approvals, material shortages, a little bit of labor issues. I'm just hoping that you can explain some of these risks that might impede that double digit growth, and how some of those constraints you see playing out into '22. JessicaHansen: Truman, it really is a little bit of everything you mentioned, but it's nothing new. It's all things, as Mike said earlier on we've been working through this entire time. So if we didn't feel confident in the double digit and the ability to continue to manage through those, and ramp up our production to more adequately meet the demand that's in the market, we wouldn't be saying that here in July. But there are constraints. And we wouldn't say any one thing, it's everything you outlined. And it varies by market, essentially, on a daily basis, what the constraint is, but our operators are doing a fantastic job of navigating through that. MikeMurray: But the positioning, we can see in our inventory, our inventory did increase by about 1,000 units this quarter, up 44% year-over-year, on a trailing 12 months basis, we've started 94,500 homes, that in and of itself is double digit growth over what our plan deliveries are this year. So we're already in position to deliver double digit, and working to improve on that and expand on that as we move into '22. We feel like we're in great position to do that. There'll be challenges. There'll be unknown challenges that we haven't dealt with yet. But we're confident in our teams and our ability to continue to maintain the current pace and incrementally improve on it as we move into '22 on our starts. JessicaHansen: And I know that's a relatively high level comment today. We're sitting in July; we haven't finished our fiscal year. So we would expect in November to give more specific guidance, in addition to just the double digit closing target. TrumanPatterson: Okay. Really, what I'm kind of looking at is on the material side; we've heard of shortages kind of across the board, but especially windows, doors, concrete, I mean, it depends which market, right? But do you actually have contracts in place, with your suppliers to actually get that level of product? MikeMurray: We have relationships with our suppliers. I mean, no matter what the contract says, you're going to get what with they're going to give you and they're going to deliver who they want to deliver to. And so we work very hard to be a good trade partner, with our suppliers in both materials and labor, and making sure they understand what our production plans are. And our commitment is to them. And they've made the commitment to us. DavidAuld: Again, it goes back to scale within these markets. I mean, we're a very important customer to do just about every material supplier in those markets. So Mike's right, it is about relationships, but it's about future relationships, as well. So is it going to be difficult path, yes, it is going to be difficult, because they're saying no to somebody, we just don't want them to be saying no to us. TrumanPatterson: Understood. And then my follow up question just a follow up very strong order ASP up 10%, quarter-over-quarter. We've just seen a lot of builders starting to employ a final and best bidding process. Just hoping to understand either what portion of your communities or the portion of that price I came from the bidding process. And then on the other side of it just with affordability there's been some talk, some believe in the industry that there's been some incentives taking up. Have you seen that in any of your local markets? DavidAuld: Certainly haven't seen any incentive ticking up. And we have used the fund to invest in certain communities and where we have a very limited lot supply. But that's not a giant component of what we're seeing on sales price or margin. Certainly it's impactful, and it's certainly happening in our extended longer communities, especially at the price points we have, we're offering in the entry level we don't like that. I personally don't like that process. Because in '05, '06 there was a false demand by people running around putting houses under contract, because they never intended to close, I don't want our operators to have a false expectation about the pricing that's achievable in the market, by having a guy from California bid on my house and stuff, work on again Texas, and then all of a sudden, every house is worth what a guy transferring in from California is willing to pay. We're trying to stay very close to these markets. And our goal is to sell everybody walks into our house and into our model for home. And we're not there right now, but we're certainly going to get there. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kenneth Zener with Keybanc Capital. KennethZener: Good morning, everybody. And don't pick on the California folks there. DavidAuld: We're making a lot of money in California right now. KennethZener: You can make more there. Alright, so look, all the stocks that are reporting today, across all the categories, record margins, record demand, limited supply, and right, what's different this cycle is that we have very low interest rates and COVID. Very high consumer credit, right, governments are printing all the money. And structurally in housing, there's a very high propensity for institutional buyers, right? I mean, it's coming from builders, like you, other large builders, something $5 billion, $6 billion portfolios all the time buying 15,000- 20,000 unit property. So, look, I think you guys obviously have the best business model in many ways, and you're working on your land supply. So I understand all that. But where are as an operator, I mean your whip is less capitalized unison inventory divided by whip than it is historically.  And your leverage is so low. I mean, what is -- what are you going to look for, I guess, to see when? Yes, it seems like you're over earning, obviously, you guys, there's nothing that'll indicate your margins are going down? You're actually got up. But I mean, what do you think it will be there? Are you looking at -- how are you looking at the existing side? How are you looking at people bidding on properties that are maybe not an individual investor, but all this institutional money that's coming in, because the cap rates are still good? What is it that you're looking at separate from the operations on the macro events that causes you? Yes, I don't know if there's a factor to that to look at rather than the operational side. That's it. Thank you. MikeMurray: I think from, looking at what macro storm clouds might be the things that might happen in the next six months or a year that we never anticipated, like a worldwide pandemic that we didn't anticipate two years ago. There are certainly things like that that can happen that could impact the business. Rising interest rates always are a significant cost input into the value of the homes and the monthly payment. And we monitor obviously that very closely and looking at affordability. I think Jessica touched on it before with two points in the stress testing we did the backlog, that the backlog can withstand some interest rate upward movement right now. In addition, the DTI, the debt-to-income levels we're seeing in our borrowers this most recent quarter, actually taking down a little bit despite the average loan size going up.  So the credit qualities of our buyers are good. Looking at our for sale communities, the vast majority of the buyers of those homes are owner occupied homes. We don't have any institutional relational outtake programs and out for sale communities. Our institutional focus would be on the build direct communities which are separate and apart from the for sale side of our business. It's hard to know all the things that may change in the future, Kenn. But one thing we do focus on and have focused on for many years is maintaining a very strong, flexible balance sheet as you said, where we have great low leverage strong equity capitalization, and very good liquidity that allows us to take advantage of the market conditions as they change and continue to consolidate market share, especially at a local level where we can turn that local market share leverage into outperformance. Operator : Thank you. That is all the time we have today for the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Darrell. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today. And look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter and full year results in November. Under the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Tremendous account accomplishments in delivering the first three quarters. Let's go finish strong and put numbers on the board that nobody's ever seen. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the U.S. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 financial results. Before we get started, today's call includes comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.  Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton 's Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are or will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor. drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K towards the end of next week. As referenced in our press release, we realigned the aggregation of our home-building operating segments into 6 new reportable segments this quarter to better allocate our home-building operating segments across our geographic reporting regions.  As a result, in addition to our standard updated investor and supplementary data presentations, we will also be posting to our Investor Relations site, 3 years of quarterly sales, closings, backlog, homes, and lock data that conforms to our new geographic region presentation. All of this can be found at investor. drhorton.com on the Presentations section under News and Events, for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today, we also have Paul Romanowski with us, who was recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer. Paul has been with D.R. Horton since 1999 serving as our Florida South Division President for 15 years, and most recently, as our Florida Region President for 7 years. I'd like to take a brief moment to have Paul introduce himself before we get started, Paul. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, David. And hello, everyone. I'm excited for the opportunity to serve in my new role on the D.R. Horton management team, and I look forward to getting to know our investors and analysts in the coming year. David Auld : Thank you, Paul. Given that Paul is new to his role, he will not be an active participant today, but we are glad to have him with us and believe his extensive home building experience will strengthen our executive team. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, which included a 63% increase in consolidated pre -tax income to $1.7 billion and a 27% increase in revenue to $8.1 billion. Our pre -tax profit margin for the quarter improved 480 basis points to 21.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 65% to $3.70. For the year, consolidated pre -tax income increased 80% to $5.4 billion on a $27.8 billion of revenue.  Our pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 460 basis points to 19.3%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 78% to $11.41. We closed a record 81,965 homes this year, an increase of over 16,500 homes or 25% from last year, while also achieving a historical low home building SG&A percentage of 7.3%. Our home building return on inventory was 37.9%, and our return on equity was 31.6%, these results reflect our experienced teams in their production capabilities. Our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint, and our product positioning to offer homes at affordable price points across multiple brands. Our home-building cash flow from operations for 2021 was $1.2 billion.  Over the past 5 years, we have generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations. While growing our consolidated revenues by 128% and our earnings per share by 383%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, reduced our homebuilding leverage 220%, and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $2.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity. Market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns and increasing our market share further. However, there are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and tightness in the labor market.  As a result, we continued restricting our home sales base during the fourth quarter by selling homes later in the construction cycle to align with our production levels and better ensure certainty of home closing date for our homebuyers. We expect to approve the supply chain challenges and ultimately increase our production capacity. After starting construction on 22,400 homes this quarter, our homes in inventory increased 26% from a year ago to 47,800 homes at September 30th, 2021. In October, we started more than 8,000 homes, further positioning us to achieve double-digit growth again in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position holds very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize our returns. Mike. Mike Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 increased 65% to $3.70 per share, and for the year, diluted earnings per share increased 78% to $11.41. Net income for the quarter increased 62% to $1.3 billion and for the year, net income increased 76% to $4.2 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 24% to $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed, up from $6.1 billion on 20,248 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $346,100, up 14% from last year. And the average size of our homes closed was down 1%, Bill? Bill Wheat : Net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 33% to 15,949 homes, and the value of those orders was $6 billion down 17% from $7.3 billion in the prior year. A year ago, our fourth quarter net sales orders were up 81% due to the surgeon housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sell and prior to the supply chain challenges that arose in 2021. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 5% from the prior year and was down 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $378,300, up 23% from the prior year. The cancellation rate for the fourth quarter was 19%, flat with the prior-year quarter.  As David described, new home demand remains very strong and our local teams are continuing to restrict our sales order pace where necessary on a community-by-community basis based on the number of homes in inventory, construction times, production capacity, and lock position. They also continue to adjust sales prices to market while staying focused on providing value to our buyers. We are still restricting the pace of our sales orders during our first fiscal quarter, but to a lesser extent than during our fourth quarter. As a result, we expect our first quarter net sales orders to be approximately equal to or slightly higher than our 20,418 sales orders in the first quarter last year. Our October net sales order volume was in line with our plans and we remain confident that we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022, with 26,200 homes in backlog, 47,000 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply, and strong trade and supplier relationships. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 26.9% up 100 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the broad strength of the housing market and benefited from the better alignment of our sales order pace to our construction schedules. The strong demand for a limited supply of homes has allowed us to continue to raise prices or lower the level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 7% sequentially, while our stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 7.5%, and our lot cost increased 2%.  We expect both our construction and lot costs will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect to offset any cost pressures with price increases. We currently expect our home-sales gross margin in the first quarter to be similar to the fourth quarter. We remain focused on managing the pricing, incentives and sales pays in each of our communities to optimize the return on our inventory investments, and adjust to local market conditions and new home demand. Bill. Bill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues was 6.9% down 70 basis points from 7.6% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 7.3% down 80 basis points from 8.1% in 2020. Our homebuilding SG&A expense, as a percentage of revenues, is at its lowest point for a quarter and for a year in our history. And we are focused on continuing to control our SG&A while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. David? David Auld : We have increased our housing inventory and response to the strength of demand, and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 22,400 homes during the fourth quarter and 91,500 homes during fiscal 2021, which is an increase of 21% compared to fiscal 2020. We ended the year with 47,800 homes in inventory, up 26% from a year ago. 21,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 900 were completed. Although we have not seen significant improvement in the supply chain yet we expect the current constraints to ultimately moderate at some point in 2022. Mike? Mike Murray : At September 30th, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 530,000 lots of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing in capital efficient lot portfolio is key to our strong competitive position and will support our efforts to increase our production volume to meet home-buyer demand. Our fourth quarter home-building investments in lot, land, and development totaled $1.8 billion, of which $1 billion was for finished lots, $330 million was for land, and $440 million was for land development. Bill. Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority-owned subsidiary is a publicly traded well-capitalized residential lot manufacturer, operating in 56 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well on its high-growth plan, as they increase their lots sold by 53% to 15,915 lots during fiscal 2021, compared to the prior year. Forestar 's pre -tax profit margin for the year improved 400 basis points to 12.4%, excluding an $18.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt. At September 30th, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 60% from a year ago to 97,000 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer, under our master supply agreement. $370 million of D.R. Horton's land and lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 35.2% with its current capitalization, strong lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : Financial services pre -tax income in the fourth quarter was $103 million on $223 million of revenues, with a pre -tax profit margin at 46.1%. For the year, financial services pre -tax income was $365 million on $824 million of revenues representing a 44.3% free tax profit margin. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage Company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage Company handled the financing for 66% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 45% of the mortgage Company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 722 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First-time home buyers represented 59% of the closings handled by our mortgage Company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our multi-family and single-family rental operations generated combined pretax income of $74.3 million in the fourth quarter and $86.5 million in fiscal 2021. Our total rental property inventory at September 30th was $841 million compared to $316 million a year ago. We sold 3 multi-family properties totaling 960 units during fiscal 2021 for $191.9 million, all of which were sold in the fourth quarter, compared to 2 properties totaling 540 units sold in fiscal 2020. We sold 3 single-family rental communities totaling 260 homes during fiscal 2021 for $75.9 million dollars, including one sale of 64 homes during the fourth quarter for $21 million dollars in revenue.  In fiscal 2022, we expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues from rental property sales. We also expect to grow the total inventory investment in our rental platforms by more than $1 billion in fiscal 2022 based on our current rental projects in development and our significant pipeline of future single and multi-family rental projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill. Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. During fiscal 2021, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.2 billion dollars, and our cumulative cash generated from homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $5.9 billion. At September 30th, we had $5 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our home building revolving credit facility. This level of liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  Our home building leverage was 17.8% at fiscal year-end, with $3.1 billion of home-building public notes outstanding, of which $350 million matures in the next 12 months. At September 30th, our stockholder's equity was $14.9 billion, and book value per share was $41.81, up 29% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 31.6%, an improvement of 950 basis points from 22.1% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $71.6 million for a total of $289.3 million of dividends paid during year. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock for $212.6 million.  And our stock repurchases during fiscal year 2021 totaled 10.4 million shares for $874 million. Our outstanding share count is down 2% from a year ago, and our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $546.2 million dollars. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis, and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Based on our financial position and outlook for fiscal 2020, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 13% to $22.5 per share. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from home buyers, but continuing supply chain challenges that will delay home constructions, completions, and closings. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our December quarter of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion and our homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 17,500 and 18,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be 26.8% to 27% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be approximately 8%. We anticipate a financial services pre -tax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the first quarter. Looking further out, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues for the full fiscal year of 2022 of $32.5 to $33.5 billion and to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24% subject to changes in potential future legislation that could increase the federal corporate tax rate.  We also expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We expect to generate positive cash flow from our home building operations in fiscal 2022 after our investments in homebuilding inventories, to support double-digit growth. We will then balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operation, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities. Industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today's robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the Company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2021 were remarkable. We closed the most homes in a year in our Company's history, achieving 10% market share with record profits and returns. And we are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we remind participants to please limit themselves to 1 question and 1 follow-up each. We also asked that while posing your question, please pick-up your handset if listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality. Please hold while we poll for question. And the first question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Morning, everybody. Welcome, Paul. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your internal plans for '22 for orders, and perhaps talk a little bit about what you see your community count doing relative to your absorptions in which you lean on more for growth in the next fiscal year. David Auld : Well, as for our sales absorptions and community count, I think we're still believing that community count is flat up single-digit -- low single-digit. And as far as our sales numbers that is good. If we're projecting to deliver 90,000 to 92,000 homes then, we've got to have sales place that matches that. And again, Carl, the key to us is making sure that when we sell a home, we know when it's going to [Indiscernible] and deliver.  And as -- what I believe is as the market continues into 2022 that you're going to see stabilization on the material side first and then the labor side. We've been working on expanding our labor base for the last 10 years. And the consistent level of starts has allowed us the -- the drive and efficiency there that has allowed us to deliver more houses and we just plan on continuing to do that. Jessica Hansen : And really rather than a focus on community count, it adds inflows quarter-to-quarter. If we start a house, we're going to ultimately sell and close it. So, we really focused on our homes and inventory, and our lot position. Carl Reichardt : Sure. Thanks, Jessica. Thanks, David. David Auld : Both of which are in very, very good shape right now. Carl Reichardt : Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then David, I wanted to go back to something that D.R. Horton has talked about in the past, that we don't hear too much from others is this idea of getting your cash out of land investments within 24 months of when you put it in, and I'm curious really on two fronts. One, the significant shift to options is probably allowed that to improve. but on the other hand, the delays entitlement and approval processes and finding dirt has probably hurt that. So can you talk about that goal of getting your cash out of your land investments within 24 months and how you see that changing over time? And thanks a lot. David Auld : I would say it's more of a requirement not a goal or less. That's something that we put in place coming out of the downturn that we have not wavered off of, and that is probably the toughest underwriting hurdle that our divisions have to face. But it's a non-negotiable program, because we saw what going long, long owning long positions at land does to your balance sheet and your risk level and what our unforeseen events that might happen on the future.  So the 24-month cash back is still a part of every deal we underwrite and has been a primary factor I think in driving our option lot position because it's -- we have to find partners. We have to to controllable lots we want to control. So we've got to be good partners with these trends, and that's been a focus through this entire cycle. And I think a major factor in that is the -- just the unrelenting underwriting requirement that you got to get your cash off the table in 24 months. Bill Wheat : And Carl to your point about extending delays and things like that, that applies when we do own our land and we're self-developing. it doesn't necessarily affect our cash return when we're working with a third-party and by buying lots because we're not buying the lots until we're ready to start homes and those approvals are in place. I would say more recently, one thing that is impacting our turns and our ability to actually return our cash in 24 months is the extension of our construction times with the supply chain delays.  We have seen further elongation of our construction times. I believe on a year-over-year basis, our closings this quarter were -- the construction times were longer by about 7 weeks, which is a bit longer than we would reported last quarter and so that is a factor that is causing a bit of friction in our inventory turns right now. But, hopefully, as we achieve some stabilization on the material side over the coming year, we will see that stabilize and, hopefully, we will be -- contract again. Carl Reichardt : Thank you, Bill. And thanks, everybody. I really appreciate the answers. David Auld : Thanks, Carl. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Carl. Operator : And your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Okay, thanks very much. Thanks guys for all the info. I guess my first question relates to your Company's comments about affordability. I guess first, am I right to think that you're driving affordability primarily through construction into design efficiencies? Or should we think that this operates is going to imply a lower gross margin? All things held constant? And then, regulated to your margin, I imagine you got peak lumber coming through your December quarter. So if lumber stays where it is right now, would it be reasonable to think that the December quarter margins is maybe likely to be the low point for the fiscal '22 year? Bill Wheat : Well, in terms of lumber cost, that they are still rising. They rose further in our fiscal Q4. We've seen them rise further into October, so we do believe that we are seeing the peak of lumber cost. However, other costs are increasing as well, we're seeing costs really increasing across-the-board so even when we see perhaps have some relief from lumber as we move further into fiscal 2022, I think that will be offset by other cost increases. As far as the net effect on gross margin, ultimately that will depend on the strength of the demand environment as we move into the spring season, and our ability to continue to offset costs with prices. Right now, our short-term view is that we should be able to offset cost with price and maintain our margins that are around the level that we just reported in the fourth quarter. But, truly as we move through fiscal 2022, it will depend on the strength of the demand environment. Jessica Hansen : And our ability to continue to achieve affordability is really across a multitude of things. It's not any one thing we would point to. Clearly, our sides and our scale and the construction efficiencies that we've been very focused on, particularly in our Express Homes brand, limiting floor plans, limiting options, being able to control the trades at our job site all-day long, house to house to house, repetitively doing the same thing over and over and over again, has been a benefit in that regard. And then to a lesser extent, we have also continued to see our average square footage come down, and that's the way we can focus on affordability as well, is building more of our smaller floor plans. David Auld : Stephen, we're constantly trying to derive a more affordable total occupancy cost for our buyers, and that effort is never going to stop. Stephen Kim : Right, and I think the gist of my question was that none of that implies unnecessarily a lower gross margin, all else held constant, right? David Auld : No, I don't -- we're not seeing that. Stephen Kim : All right. That's why I wanted to clarify. Okay. And then secondly, regarding sales restrictions, obviously really encouraging, we do an analysis of your starts and your inventory. It's certainly we agree. We saw a really big, positive inflection in your production metrics that we can see externally and so I wanted to ask you about your comment about the sales restrictions, because a layperson or somebody listening from the outside could hear you say, hey, we are reducing our sales restrictions and things that themselves will be yes, that's because demand has weakened. And so therefore, there aren't as many people on waiting list and things like that. And so I was wondering if you could clarify with maybe a little more detail, are you -- these sales restrictions which are starting to get alleviated or being relaxed, is that a sign of slowing demand or increasing supply? And assuming it's not a weakening of demand, I just wanted to go back to what you said in March. I think Jessica, that they get you a stress test that your backlog. I felt that gave a lot of comfort about affordability, I was wondering if you did that recently? Mike Murray : That last question, yes, we did update the stress test and we look at that every quarter in our backlog and found no real change. In fact, to maybe a slight improvement from the March quarter to what we saw in September quarter backlog. In the sales restrictions, it's certainly a function of supply. We're seeing that we have been able to pull more homes to the production process to points, where we are able to give that buyer a more confident delivery date and give them a better experience in the process. I don't think that in anyway, it's sales that have been reflective of the demand environment.  We have consciously chosen not to push our sales contracts and take advantage of that demand until we can meet those customer expectations properly. So we've seen that our completed homes in inventory that are unsold are still below 1,000 homes. And that's scattered across the country, so it's not like we're seeing any pile up of available inventory. It's when we're releasing homes, we're able to sell those homes in the normal course of business. Jessica Hansen : As a reminder for those may not have heard the stress test commentary last quarter and just to quantify that, the stress that we've done on our backlog is if interest rates were to rise 100 basis points, what that at-risk buyer would look like, and it's generally mid-to-high single-digit percentage of potential at-risk with a full 100 basis point move, And that's really just at risks. We would not expect a total fallout in that regard. We look to document additional income, look to put those buyers and additional different mortgage products and they currently anticipating. we feel pretty comfortable still with the ability of our buyers from an affordability perspective. Stephen Kim : Thanks for all the info, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Please go ahead. Matthew Bouley : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results here in a pretty tough environment. So on the order outlook, Bill, you spoke to the Q1 uptick and I think suggesting basically 28% higher sequentially versus Q4, which is certainly well above historical norms, and not surprising as you released those sales restrictions and the inventory homes are there. Does this atypical uptick get you back to equilibrium for lack of a better term? Or should we understand that just given your inventory position ahead of the spring that we can perhaps see yet another, I guess I'd call it unusual uptick as you kind of released those sales and continue to lessen the sales restrictions. Thank you. Bill Wheat : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think we're still in an unusual environment. The prior-year trends really don't apply to where we are today. Our sales order pace and the sequential pace of our shareholders is really driven by supply, by the homes that we have started, that we have in production that reached the stage that were ready to release them for sales, and so our sales volumes are really governed by or constrained by our homes in inventory where they stand. And so right now, with the visibility that we have to Q1, we believe we're in position where we will deliver sales that are equal to or maybe, slightly better than last year's level, which is an unusual sequential pattern versus where we were in Q4 when we were restricting sales. And then as we move into the year, I think the pattern will still be governed by our inventory levels. Mike Murray : I think what you're gonna see in our forward expectation on sales, it's kind of aligning with our growth in starts that we've had over the past few quarters as Bill said, as those homes come through production and reach production stages that we're confident in a delivery date, then we're able to release those to the marketplace for sales. Matthew Bouley : That's great. Thank you both for that. Secondly, on ASP's, I think the revenue guide from doing the math right, implies maybe mid to high single-digit increases in ASP's in fiscal year '22 give or take. Obviously, you're order ASP's have been north of that for two consecutive quarters, if not well north of that here in Q4. Are there any assumptions around geographic or product mix that we should be aware of that might temper closing ASP s into next year? Bill Wheat : we're looking at the year as a whole and what our ASP will be for the year will ultimately be dependent on the spring selling season. And so the assumption that these prices for the year will be up mid-to-high single-digit, I think that's fair. We're not going to assume that prices will continue to increase as fast as they have. And so our base assumption will be there will be some moderation in sales prices. We're going to continue to be focused on affordability from an intentional perspective for our business. And so for our initial guide going into the year prior to seeing what the spring will look like, prior to seeing what the supply chain challenges will continue to be. And what that will do to us over the course of the year, we've set our ASP target as you've seen. Matthew Bouley : Great. Well, thank you all and good luck. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut of JP Morgan. Mike, your line is live. Please go ahead. Mike Rehaut : Thanks, good morning, everyone. First question, I was hoping to get a little bit of sense of how you're thinking about gross margins? At least perhaps directionally through fiscal '22 and even longer term. Understanding, obviously, a lot is in flux. But as you look through the rest of the year, obviously a lot of people are focusing on the reduction of lumber cost, as a tailwind. At the same time, you have some other headwinds in terms of additional cost inflation and I guess, assuming incentives and discounts are steady, just trying to get a sense of how you think at this point between lumber and other areas of cost inflation in the current pricing that you have in place, how things might progress throughout the rest of '22. Jessica Hansen : We really don't have much visibility to our gross margin past a quarter or two, so you heard our specific gross margin guide for fiscal Q1, which was essentially relatively in line with Q4. As Bill mentioned, continued lumber headwinds in that December quarter. Some of that does back off as we move throughout next year. But ultimately, the gross margin that we achieved for fiscal 2022 as a whole is going to be dependent on the strength of the spring selling season, which we're pretty far out on. But I think we do feel with the strength in today's market, we should be in a very good position to continue to hopefully at least maintain gross margins from here. But we'll update as necessary as we move throughout the year and see how the spring unfolds and some of these supply chain pressures that are continuing to drive some cost increases. Mike Rehaut : Right. Appreciate that. I guess also just longer term. You're in a new state of play here in terms of plus or minus around 27%. Just 3 years ago you were at closer to 20% and versus the last cycle. I think your peak was around 25.5% in 2005. Over the next 2, 3, or 4 years, as your underwriting deals today, and just curious, obviously, you underwrite them for returns, but there was a gross margin component in that. How should we think about a quote unquote normal or even a new normal? Again, assuming that we don't have this over the next 12 to 18 months, like a complete mean reversion to a let's say, a fuller incentive pipe backdrop or whatnot. Mike Murray : Appreciate that, and it's a great point. One, we do focus first and foremost on returns and not just the margin. You're right, it is a component of the return equation. And three years ago, as you mentioned we were around 20% and if we had said at the time, we think three years from now, we will be at 27%. I don't think we'd have gotten a lot of credibility for that prediction. So it's really hard, as Jeff mentioned before, to really give us any great degree of confidence in predicting accurately what margins will be several periods out. I do think in our forward underwriting, is that we are encouraged by what we see and what we'll be able to achieve in margins going forward. And ultimately it's the return and the cash back that's driving our investment decisions today. Jessica Hansen : Two of the things that we can't point to -- a lot of questions have been about other structural changes in the business that can lead to maintaining a higher gross margin over the long term than what we've historically seen. They're not enough to keep us at 27%, but two things we would point to, that we believe we can maintain are the scale advantages. There would expect to maintain some level of improvement in our margin from that. But then also less interest in our cost of sales. With what we've done with our balance sheet in terms of reducing our leverage, we will be flowing through less cost of sales consistently going forward. David Auld : Coincidentally [Indiscernible] consolidated, it's a maturing industry. My anticipation is, you're going to see more stability than typically has been associated around prior cycles. I think that there is a consistency discipline in the industry today, that has never existed. Mike Rehaut : One last quick one, if I could sneak it in, how should we think about community count and sales pace in 2022 versus 2021 in terms of I think both for -- in terms of just growth from both aspects. Jessica Hansen : It's going to continue to be mainly driven by absorption rather than community count. We would expect for the full year to have a modest increase in our community count. But I think as I referenced in at apparel at the outset of the call. If we have the houses and lots, we're going to ultimately selling close the house. And so that 's generally the better indicator of where our business is going and just what our absolute community count is doing. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is coming from Deepak Raghav. Deepak, your line is live. Please go ahead. Deepak Raghav : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my questions. My first 1 is on your start space in October, 8-K Ohio Homes that possess a pretty solid rate. Perhaps there's some timing benefit here. But can you walk us through some of the puts and takes to a normalized touched-pace near-term, or is this a good run rate for 2023 deliveries with perhaps upside when supply chain improves? David Auld : I think the a run rate that we're targeting is pretty well established for the first 4 to 6 months of this year. So that's a consistent run rate we're targeting. I think that we're basing our guidance and everything and what we're projecting for the year on the way the supply chain exists today. And we have to carry more houses and inventory to support that double-digit growth than we typically have had to do on the past. So we're positioning for -- we'll see what the spring brains and we'll see what the material and labor supply issues either resolve, mitigate, or get worse. Jessica Hansen : It's a lot easier to slow down our start than it is to speed it up. So we consistently adjust our start based on what our forward outlook is. David Auld : What we control is our liquidity, and our process, and our targets. And we're very focused on the liquidity, because it's a risk mitigator that allows us to be more flexible, in what we target and how we operate. Bill Wheat : We've already talked on this call about we are in an unusual time in terms of how our sales pace looks. We're also an unusual time in terms of historical measures of our homes and inventory relative to what we can close, with extended construction times and all the disruptions. As David said, we have to hold more homes in inventory to deliver the same number of closings today versus a few years ago. Jessica Hansen : The offset to that is we own a lot of land, in terms of years supply, so we are still driving very impressive returns. David Auld : Well, again, we're very focused on liquidity and maintaining the flexibility, that is a key competitive advantage, I think for whatever happens in the market. Deepak Raghav : All fair comments. Thanks for that. My follow-up is pretty high level question to the extent you're just willing to discuss. How do you think the supply chain is going to play out? Do appreciate that the visibility is not great beyond a quarter or more at best, but just given the current state, what are your thoughts on the realistic best-case, worst-case scenario playing out in fiscal 2022? Or even if you don't want to go all out to 2022, what are some of the scenarios as we enter spring selling season? Thank you. David Auld : From a supply chain standpoint, I think you've got some of the best companies that have ever existed in the history of the world focused on that, and I think they're going to get it figured out. And the people that we do business with are the best of the best in that industry, so I'm very confident. Was it Q1, Q2, Q3? I don't know that, but I am very confident that the people that are working on it are going to get a result, and when that happens I think we will return to an inventory conversion rate that's consistent with what we've done in the past, maybe even a little better. Deepak Raghav : All right, that's great. I'll pass it on, thanks very much and good luck. David Auld : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live. Please go ahead. Asher Sohnen : Hi, this is Asher Sohnen on for Anthony and I just want to ask, you mentioned that you need more homes in inventory now to deliver the same number of homes. Are you able to articulate a target or maybe your normalized spec count for this kind of new normal? And then when supply chain do clear up, do you expect to reduce that spec count eventually, or because it's become like the new normal going forward? Bill Wheat : Absolutely. When we get back to a more normalized time, we would expect our inventory turns to return back to historical norms, or as David said, or better. Historically, if you looked at the beginning of the year for us, you could take our homes in inventory and you can pretty well double that and that's what we would close the next year. Sometimes we've done a little better than that, sometimes a little worse. Given the current environment if it remains as tough as it is right now, we probably -- we will not be able to do that. Our guidance obviously would it would imply that, but absolutely. When we get back to a more normal time, we would expect to reduce our spec count and turn our inventory and focus on generating the best returns that we possibly can. This is simply a reflection of the current environment we are in, the elongated construction times we're seeing Asher Sohnen : Great. And then as a follow-up, just understanding that the sales declines in the quarter is kind of a function of supply. But I'm just curious. And -- have you any -- have you seen any markets where maybe prices are starting to get a bit frothy or that you're concerned around affordability, maybe seeing some buyers start to walk away around the margins? Mike Murray : I think it's pretty clear that the market is not as white hot right now as it was in the spring. But we're still seeing very strong demand, and the homes that we're releasing for sale are still being absorbed quite well with very historical low levels of incentives in place. So we're seeing very few homes complete construction that are not being sold prior to that completion process. David Auld : And I'd also say that even though our ASP has gone up and it's not a sustainable rise quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter, but it is something that I think indicates the level of demand out there when you restrict the number of houses you sell. It's a good time to be selling houses today. Asher Sohnen : Demand still exceed supply? David Auld : Yes. Jessica Hansen : And I think, in terms of Mike 's comment is not quite as high as spring. We are seeing, I think, somewhat of a return to normal seasonality as well. We wouldn't expect the market to be as strong today as it is during the spring selling season. So we still feel very good as we move throughout fiscal '22, that the market is going to remain robust. Mike Murray : Those 900 homes we have that are completed and unsold, less than 100 have been completed for an extended period of time, out of almost 50,000 homes. Asher Sohnen : Thanks, that's very helpful. I'll turn it up -- I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you, your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is live. Please go ahead. Jade Rahmani : Thank you very much. On the land side, you said that sequentially lot costs were up 2% quarter-over-quarter. How much do you think they're up year-over-year? Jessica Hansen : Give me one second, Jade. I have it. I just -- they are up about a mid-single-digit percentage, which has been pretty consistent as of last year too on a year-over-year basis. Jade Rahmani : Okay. That's somewhat surprising because I think, historically, land usually appreciates in line with appreciation, or perhaps at a faster clip. Do you expect lot costs to begin accelerating? Is the moderate pace of growth reflective of the timing at which you acquired these lots? Mike Murray : That's got a lot to do with it, Jade. It's -- the homes we're delivering this quarter are delivered on a large variety of vintages, of lot acquisitions, of when we contracted for the land, and contracted for the lots, and so you're seeing a big blend come through. So generally we are seeing cost inflation, and our lot costs and what we're currently buying and -- but it takes -- it's a muted impact in the near term and it takes several years for those costs to be fully reflected through into our closings. Bill Wheat : And this is one of the strengths of our long lock for lot pipeline and our controlled lot position because we've got land and lots controlled generally at fixed prices or at known prices and so we reap the benefits of that by having a strong controlled lot position. Jade Rahmani : Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Please go ahead. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions, and Paul, congratulations on the promotion. Just wanted to follow up on a prior question, but your '22 closings expectations up about 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. You all mentioned material shortages and multiple products currently, but David, you've made a couple of comments that you expect improvement in 2022. I'm just trying to understand what are your suppliers telegraphing you with respect to 2022 capacity. Are they adding employees, lines, etc.? Just what sort of level of growth do they think they can support? David Auld : We've got commitments from all of our major material guys. They're going to support us. They know our numbers. They know what we're trying to accomplish. They see our start base for the last 6 months and the next 6 months. So -- and they are really good companies. I'm not going to pill out a bunch of names because I'll forget about half of them. CEO of Oracle came in and with Don Horton, myself and the entire executive team, it's a level of partnership and commitment to each other. I think that just hadn't existed in the past. And I think as a result of the consolidation of the industry, and the significant 10% market share of new home housing is a real number. Jessica Hansen : And in our conversations they are hiring, they are opening new lines, unemployment benefit going away as expected to have some impact. I think some of the extended impacts from the Texas freeze is also expected to be worked through as we move into calendar 2022. And as David said, these things are taking a while to work through, but they are doing what they need to do to help support our business. And as always, we expect them to support D.R. Horton's business first and for a lot of those pressures to be solved what smaller builders versus us. David Auld : Having scale -- significant scale in these markets, is a huge benefit for us and I think really gives us more access and better service than some of those smaller, less -- people with less scale. Mike Murray : Having a forward locked pipeline of over 0.5 million lots makes it pretty powerful as a conversation piece in talking with the large suppliers. Truman Patterson : Okay, fair enough. And in your capital allocation priorities, I don't believe that I heard anything about MNA. Could you just discuss any inter -- or the level in your pipeline that you're seeing our valuation stretched at this point. Then just a second question, I'm sure it's well deserved, but could you all just run through the decision behind creating the Co-COO chair? Mike Murray : Sure. I'll take the first question and let David handle the second question. The M&A landscape is pretty similar to where it's been the past few quarters. It's anecdotal. We're not looking for any major transformational M&A opportunities. It would be hard for us to accomplish one of those at the scale we're at today. But we are looking at tucking in acquisitions to add great platforms and people to the team across the country, where we maybe looking for growth. And it's an ongoing conversation with people in that process, but don't look for any major use of capital on that front today. David Auld : And on the Co-COO program, in looking at our platform it would basically have doubled in the last five years, and during COVID trying to get places being not only from an executive officer standpoint, but from a regional president standpoint. We were asking gas to get employees and really became less and less comfortable with that, I think on the last call I might have statement about infrastructure, and then immediately had a quick talking about it because the infrastructure I was talking about was our platform, which was a dual COO roles, and then doubling our reach account. So that we're continuing to scale up our platform, to make -- to coincide with the scale-up in market share that we're gaining. We've got great people that are performed at exceptional levels. But as you move up that next step, the world changes and the skill set changes.  So you've got to get young guys in a position to -- in my mind, anyway, and what we've talked about up here, you've got to get the younger guy into a position, a regional role where he is working through divisions instead of on top of divisions. And it's a training process. And so while we've got a great market, while we're scaling up in absorptions, we need to scale up in people. And Paul gives us the ability to touch the regional guys more consistently, and to be in new markets more consistently. As he travels, Mike travels, I travel. And by increasing the number of regions, we were then able to elevate people within divisions to leadership roles, and it's just kind of a consistent stairstep where we get more people access to that role and give them a chance to learn that job before something happens and you're forced to make a change. So it's a core of continuing to scale for our next 5 years in a row, and it's -- we've got great people and we've got an incredibly strong management team, and that's something that to be honest with you, I think about hold the time. It's the quality of our people, at that division level and region level compared to when I started with the Company or compared to when we went public, or even compared to the last cycle. What I call super-cycle [Indiscernible] So it's a -- the Company is in incredibly good position with incredibly good people. And Paul is going to help us get -- make it even better. So -- Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you all. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live. Please go ahead. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Two things. First of all, in terms of the spring selling season, I know that you don't have visibility to it. And so there's, by definition, some degree of uncertainty. But as you look at your position and what you're seeing in the market now, could you identify these are the areas of notable uncertainty that you just won't know until you get to the spring? Mike Murray : That's the unknown-unknown. Always a great question. It's one of the things we're always trying to ponder and peer around the quarter, and figure out what's going to happen. But one of the big unknown is going into the year is not from a demand side, but from a production capacity side. As David said before, it's going to get better, stay the same or get worse. I mean, it may different parts of it maybe law free over the next six to nine months and being prepared to handle those challenges is what we deal with every day.  As we say, when people want to and can buy homes, we can solve the rest of the problems, that's our job. Still see good demand trends out there, still see very good traffic, this fall in the models. Quality of traffic, interest of traffic, and our [Indiscernible] participation has been really strong, starting to fall. So that for us, that would be a good sign for continuing what happens. David Auld : What we can control, Eric, is inventory and how we position it to be in front of the spring market, and that we feel very good about. So we can -- that is where we can have targets, we can have a plan. We can execute that plan and then we'll respond to the market as it comes. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, a lot of talk about affordability earlier in the call and I know there's a lot of components of affordability, but ultimately, for your customer, it's them paying the price for the house. And the order ASP, I think coming out of [Indiscernible] is now 380,000, which is certainly different than it was two or three years ago for the Company. I'm just curious how you think about that. If especially, how you think about it relative to the different products that you have and relative to markets. How do you think consumers respond to that, customers respond to that and the path forward? Mike Murray : It's something we talked about and try to stay focused on providing more affordable homes and being the relative affordable choice in a given marketplace. We look at our mortgage companies statistics and we can see that almost 60% of our buyers this quarter were first-time homebuyers, and almost 60% of our buyers had a combined household income -- reported income for the mortgage purposes, at least of $90,000 or less. And so we still think that's -- that provides a good target market for us to continue to look to serve. And while we have seen pricing come up and average loan size come up the debt-to-income ratios that we're seeing across the loans we're underwriting has not really budged. It's been pretty consistent. Jessica Hansen : And as the industry as a whole has continued to increase sales prices, Generally speaking, we still do have the lowest average sales price generally than almost all the large public builders. Eric Bosshard : Okay, that's helpful context, thank you. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : And the final question we have time for today is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I'd love to drill in a little bit on the rental operations, obviously breaking it out this quarter, and certainly, I think over $700 million of revenue -- clearly got some aggressive growth plans there. So focusing first on the single-family rental side, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the rollout there and maybe what you've been surprised on or maybe what's reaffirmed your views up to this point as you start leasing up communities and selling them? Are you seeing any interesting trends on who these renters are? Are they longer-term renters that are choosing to rent? Are they people waiting for a new home to be built? Any kind of either anecdotal or data you can provide there? And longer term, how big of a piece of the business do you want to target this at? David Auld : I would say that the renters are not terribly different than first-time home buyers. People moving into areas, they're looking for housing, they're looking for a better lifestyle. Things that probably have surprised us, level of demand and the lack of, not only from a rental standpoint, but from what I consider institutional type investor base that has bought the three that we saw. It may not be a white-hot for sale business this year compared to last year. But it is a white-hot build a ramp business, especially the way we're positioning these projects as kind of on the affordable land, self-contained, not intermixed with for sale housing. Alan Ratner : Got it, so on that note, David, with strong as demand has been, I guess, first off, is the 35% margin that you guys generated at that business, is that a realistic intermediate-term margin on that $700+ million of revenue? And is the plan still to do the merchant-build approach? You mentioned the institutional capital, a lot of your peers have either partnered up with some of those investors and established joint ventures or some ongoing investment there. It seems like you're kind of choosing more of the merchant-build approach. So profitability and longer-term, any reason why maybe the strategy changes there. Bill Wheat : We've got a small sample size thus far on those that we've plugged have been very pleased with the profit levels we've seen. I expect we will still see some projects that will generate those level of profits, but as we grow the platform and as we build the infrastructure in place to support a larger volume across the country. We wouldn't necessarily expect to continue to generate the same margin that we've shown on these first few, but do expect pretax profit margins to be higher on the rental business than on our for-sale business and to generate an accretive return, it needs to be a little bit higher, because of the assets are held a little bit longer. We do still expect to see very attractive profit levels on the rental business, but the current sample size is still little bit small. Alan Ratner : And as we've said before, as we learn the business then we'd make our capitalization decisions about how to go about capitalizing the business. So we're still evaluating that, looking at options there. David Auld : I will say that everything we worked on, everything we think about, we want to do things that are sustainable and scalable, and I can tell you that the rental side of this market certainly seem sustainable and with our platform is scalable. So we're pretty excited about it. Alan Ratner : Great, thanks for all the color there guys. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the floor back to David Auld for closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January on our first-quarter results. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. You were the first home builder to close more than 50,000 homes, you are now the first to close greater than 80,000 homes in a year, and you're well on your way to becoming the first home-builder to close more than 100,000 homes in a year. Stay humble, stay hungry, and stay focused. You'll compete and continue to win every day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this, thus, conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Holly, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q later today or tomorrow. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter, highlighted by a 48% increase in earnings to $3.17 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income increased 45% to $1.5 billion. On a 19% increase in revenues and our consolidated pretax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 21.2%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 38.5%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 32.4%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton\u2019s scale across our broad geographic footprint. Even with the recent rise in mortgage rates, housing market conditions remain very robust, and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. We are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms. After starting construction on 25,500 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from a year ago to 54,800 homes with only 1,000 unsold completed homes across the nation. Our January home starts and net sales holders were in line with our targets, and we are well-positioned to achieve double-digit volume growth in 2022. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales base and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 48% to $3.17 per diluted share, compared to $2.14 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 44% to $1.1 billion, compared to $792 million. Our first quarter home sales revenues increased 17% to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed, up from $5.7 billion on 18,739 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $361,800, up 19% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5% to 21,522 homes, while the value increased 29% from the prior year to $8.3 billion. A year ago, our first quarter net sales orders were up 56% due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we\u2019ve experienced since. Our average number of active selling communities decreased 3% from the prior year quarter and was up 3% sequentially. Our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was $383,600, up 22% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the first quarter was 15%, down from 18% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. Our local teams are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. We plan to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner during the spring, and we expect our number of net sales orders in our second quarter to be equal to the same quarter in the prior year were up by no more than a low-single digit percentage. Our January home sales and net sales order volume were in line with our plans, and we are well-positioned to deliver double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29,300 homes in backlog, 54,800 homes in inventory, a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 27.4%, up 50 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. The increase in our gross margin from September to December reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, our home sales revenues were up 3.4% sequentially while our cost of sales per square foot increased 2.9%. We expect our construction and lot costs will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today\u2019s market conditions, we expect to offset most cost pressures with price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the first quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the first quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.5%, down 40 basis points from 7.9% in the prior year quarter. Our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any first quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further. We started 25,500 homes during the quarter, up 12% from the first quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 94,200 homes. We ended the quarter with 54,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 25,600 of our total homes at December 31 were unsold, of which only 1,000 were completed. Our average cycle or average construction cycle time for homes closed in the first quarter has increased by almost two weeks since our fourth quarter and two months from a year ago. Although, we have not seen much improvement in the supply chain yet, we are focused on working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike? Mike Murray : At December 31, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 550,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our growing and capital-efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and is supporting our efforts to increase our production volume to meet demand. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $570 million was for land development and $390 million was to acquire land. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot manufacturer, operates in 55 markets across 23 states. Forestar continues to execute extremely well and now expects to grow its lot deliveries this year to a range of 19,500 to 20,000 lots with a pretax profit margin of 13.5% to 14%. At December 31, Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position increased 33% from a year ago to 103,300 lots. 58% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer based on executed purchase and sale agreements. $330,000 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 33.9%. With its current capitalization, strong lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton, Forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business. Bill? Bill Wheat : Financial services pretax income in the first quarter was $67.1 million with a pretax profit margin of 36.4% compared to $84.1 million and 44.9% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 98% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66% of our home buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 44% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 721 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our rental operations generated pretax income of $70.1 million on revenues of $156.5 million in the first quarter compared to $8.6 million of pretax income on revenues of $31.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2021. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $1.2 billion compared to $386 million a year ago. We sold one multifamily rental property of 350 units for $76.2 million during the quarter. There were no sales of multifamily rental properties during the prior year quarter. We sold two single-family rental properties totaling 225 homes during the quarter for $80.3 million compared to one property sold in the prior year quarter for $31.8 million. At December 31, our rental property inventory included $519 million of multifamily rental properties and $642 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. In fiscal 2022, we continue to expect our rental operations to generate more than $700 million in revenues. We also expect to grow the inventory investment in our rental platform by more than $1 billion this year based on our current projects in development and our significant pipeline of future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. During the three months ended December, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand. At December 31, we had $4.1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 17.3% at the end of December and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6.9%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 25.1%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.2%. At December 31, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $15.7 billion and book value per share was $44.25, up 29% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 32.4% compared to 24.4% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $80.1 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $278.2 million during the quarter. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $268 million. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from homebuyers, but continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $7.3 billion to $7.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 19,000 and 20,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 27.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 7.5%. We anticipate the financial services pretax profit margin in the range of 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the second quarter. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect to close between 90,000 and 92,000 homes, while we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $34.5 billion to $35.5 billion. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24%, and we also continue to expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2% at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year after our investments in home building inventories to support double-digit growth. We will then continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today\u2019s robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Jessica Hansen : Holly, can you open the line for questions, please? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, gross margins across the industry have risen to levels that are probably not sustainable over the longer term. I guess the question is, do you believe that this kind of mid to high 20% margin range could persist at DHI for maybe a couple of years? And then as we move forward, what has structurally changed in your opinion that would allow you to have trend margins that are maybe 100 to 200 basis points above the historical average? Jessica Hansen : Sure, John. We\u2019re very pleased with where our gross margins have gotten through this cycle, and certainly, the strength in the market has been a large driver of that. We probably would never sit here today and say that those are sustainable at these levels through cycles. Typically, gross margin does get somewhat competed away when markets soften. That being said, we\u2019re at extremely strong levels today and can still generate very strong returns even with some margin compression, and we\u2019ll continue to meet the market over time. In terms of what we believe is sustainable, though, compared to our historical averages, certainly, we\u2019re carrying less interest in our cost of sales today. And with what we\u2019ve done from a deleveraging and our balance sheet focus, we would expect that to be a sustainable cost advantage. And then there\u2019s scale advantages with where we\u2019ve gotten in terms of our volume and our building efficiencies with our labor trades and our material suppliers, we would expect some component of the scale advantages to be sustainable as well. David Auld : And John, we talked a little bit about this. Internally, we talk a lot about it. The industry is changing. It\u2019s just a much more disciplined industry than it was through the last cycle. As we gained in market share as the other public gain in market share. There\u2019s just less \u2013 at least in my mind, my expectation is, there\u2019ll be less volatility at the cycle up and down. It\u2019s just the real businesses today, not speculators. John Lovallo : Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. And then my second question, in an environment where rates are likely to rise here, what do you view as the strategic advantages of implementing a predominantly spec-focused building model and targeting entry-level buyers, perhaps maybe versus a build-to-order model targeting better financed buyers? Mike Murray : First of all, John, what we would say is that we\u2019re able to more closely time the application for the mortgage, the qualification for the mortgage and the closing of that mortgage. So the buyer is spending less time in backlog when they\u2019re buying a house that has already started the production process that allows us to have fewer bad things happen to their potential credit profile where then they fall out of backlog and no longer qualify less interest rate risk while they\u2019re in that cycle. And then finally, just a continued focus on affordability, I mean we\u2019re going to continue to seek to be affordable for our homebuyers and our markets. John Lovallo : Got it. Thank you guys. Mike Murray : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Yes. Thanks very much, guys. I appreciate all the color here. I was particularly intrigued by your comment about the number of homes you have under construction, 56,600, I think. And I think you also mentioned that your cycle time increased about two weeks. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but that would imply, I think, that your time from start to close is about 7.5 months. First of all, is that correct? Jessica Hansen : Roughly, yes. David Auld : Yes. Stephen Kim : Yes. So if I think about your 56,600 homes and assume that you\u2019ll \u2013 you assume basically a 7.5-month cycle time, that would imply that you should be able to close 45,280 over the next two quarters. Your guidance for the second \u2013 this next quarter is, I think, for 19,000 to 20,000 homes, so considerably less than half of that amount. And so I\u2019m curious as to \u2013 is there anything wrong with the way I\u2019m thinking about, how your homes on your construction should ultimately result in closings over the next two quarters, given your cycle time is 7.5 months. And if therefore, we should be thinking that there might be an acceleration in 3Q closings on that basis? Or if you \u2013 if this represents some conservatism about extending cycle times? Mike Murray : Thank you, Steve. I think one of the things you need to look at is how long those houses have been in production. We started a substantial number of those homes in the most recent quarter. I think we stepped up our starts from Q4 to Q1 by about 3,000 homes. So those homes are obviously going to take a little longer to deliver in the process. Paul Romanowski : And as we\u2019re looking at the remainder of the year, the guidance we\u2019re providing for Q2 is based on where the homes are in construction today. But yes, as we look at the full year based on when we started the homes, and we look at where our guidance is for the full year, we are a bit more back-end loaded in terms of our closings in Q3 and Q4 than historically. We are part of that is because of the elongated construction times that we have not seen improved yet, and it\u2019s based on where our homes in construction currently set in terms of the construction cycle. Stephen Kim : Yes. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. My second question relates to your initiatives in the rental area, which I think is \u2013 you\u2019ve talked about growing that inventory, and therefore, I would assume the associated revenues pretty significantly on a longer-term basis. My question is twofold : one, is there a rule of thumb that we could think what \u2013 let\u2019s say, every $1 billion of inventory on a steady-state basis might yield in terms of a level of revenues that we could be forecasting? And then secondly, conceptually, do you think that the demand for selling your rental properties is likely to be more resilient in the face of a rising rate environment than perhaps sales to folks who would be looking to actually move in? I know that\u2019s your core business, but nevertheless, there is so much concern that many people have about rising rates and the impact on the entry-level buyer that I was curious as to whether you felt like there was a backstop behind that buyer for rental operators that are sort of getting in line and would love to buy the homes that you\u2019re building for rent. Paul Romanowski : Well, I\u2019ll start, Steve. I guess, first, we\u2019re still growing this business and learning this business. Still a little bit early for us to be able to generalize on averages in terms of what level of revenue we might see per unit. We\u2019re building across our entire homebuilding footprint. So every property is unique in terms of size and the product and the market in which it\u2019s in. So we\u2019re individually underwriting each one relative to whether it\u2019s better for-rent community versus a for-sale community. Obviously, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the value that we\u2019ve been able to generate thus far and very excited about the opportunity of growing this business and adding value over time and been very pleased with the demand that there has been for our communities thus far and the execution that we\u2019ve seen in terms of our sales thus far. Bill Wheat : Yes. Stephen, we see such strong demand today for this product in this low interest rate environment. And I think to your question of if we see rates tick up, do we see that shift? We like the ability to be in the market with this rental platform and be able to adjust to those shifts and market conditions. We do believe that we\u2019re going to continue to see strong demand. Maybe not as strong as it is today with such a new category, but we feel good about our position and the number of communities we\u2019re planning. Stephen Kim : Sounds good. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was on the SG&A side. You came in nicely below your prior guidance at 7.5% versus 8% before versus your 8% guidance and down 40 bps year-over-year. You\u2019re also guiding for, I guess, 2Q guidance to be down only 10 bps year-over-year. So I was just curious around what were the sources of the significantly better-than-expected results in the first quarter, and why you don\u2019t expect further leverage in the second quarter similar to the first? Bill Wheat : Sure. Thanks, Mike. In the current environment where we\u2019re seeing such significant average selling price increases. That\u2019s certainly one driver of the SG&A leverage on the P&L. A little difficult to predict exactly where the average ASP might fall in a particular quarter. The trend over time has been upward over the last several quarters, though, and that\u2019s certainly a contributor to it. So I would say, we\u2019re probably a little bit conservative in projecting out the level of increases in our ASPs. We are very actively building infrastructure to support the significant increase in scale that we have seen across our business over the last year and that we\u2019re projecting for the rest of the coming year, and so we are anticipating significant increases in our SG&A spend to support that. And so we\u2019re just basically balancing that versus our expectations for our closings. And with our closings expectations essentially roughly flat with last year in Q2 based on our guidance, we\u2019re not getting the volume leverage, but we are still seeing the leverage from selling price increases. Mike Rehaut : Okay. Bill. So before I just hit on the second question, just to make sure I understand, given the expectation for the stronger revenue growth on a full year basis, it seems like it\u2019s safe to assume maybe more than like a 10 bps SG&A leverage for the full year. If I\u2019m thinking about that right, given you have the higher confidence, let\u2019s say, around an ASP for the full year at least. If you could comment on that, that would be helpful. And then secondly, just on the rental income side that was a source of upside, I believe, relative to our expectations. I believe relative to guidance as well, if I\u2019m not mistaken. 45% of a margin, is that the right \u2013 that 45%? Just any guidance or thoughts around how to think about the remainder of the year relative to the revenue generation you continue to expect? Bill Wheat : Okay. Well, first to wrap up the SG&A question. We\u2019re not guiding specifically to the full year on SG&A. However, with the kind of heavier volume expected in our annual guidance in Q3 and Q4, we would expect to see more leverage on SG&A probably than 10 basis points in Q3 and Q4 versus Q2. With respect to the rental expectations, we\u2019ve guided annually to more than $700 million of revenue. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the margins and the execution we\u2019ve seen on the sales recently. The margin this quarter, obviously, was very strong. Some projects will continue to generate those margins, others could certainly be short of that. We haven\u2019t specifically guided to the margin on that business as of yet because each project is unique. In terms of volume in the coming quarter, we would expect Q2 volume to be relatively similar to Q1, and which we closed two single-family properties and one multifamily property. And then for the year, basically lining that out to the $700 million of revenue. Mike Rehaut : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner with Zelman. Alan, your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hey, good morning. Great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I might be parsing the comments a little bit too much here, so I just want to get some clarification. I think you guys said earlier that you expect to offset most cost increases with price increases. And obviously, up to this point, it\u2019s \u2013 based on the margin trajectory, you\u2019ve been able to offset more than the cost increases. So I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s a change in your thinking. Whether you\u2019re going to be maybe a little bit less aggressive pushing prices as 2022 progresses? Or am I reading too much into that comment? David Auld : I just \u2013 Alan, as we continue to increase our starts for demand, I would say at some point, there\u2019s going to be more of an equilibrium. And at that point, margins and ASPs should mitigate some \u2013 we don\u2019t know. Again, we\u2019re return-based absorption targets, start targets, being able to sustain a level of starts drives efficiencies through the entire process. We don\u2019t know what the future is. We do know that we can operate within that future and maximize the results, both returns and market share gains. Jessica Hansen : And part of that thought process also, Alan, is our continued focus on affordability. And so although the market is really strong today and we continue to take price, we\u2019re probably not out there like some other builders trying to take every last dollar of price. We\u2019re doing what we can to meet the market and try to stay affordable in spite of rising cost conditions. Alan Ratner : Got it. Both of that makes a lot of sense, and Jessica, your follow-on comment there was actually something I was going to ask next and that\u2019s that your price increases, especially on the order side, have been very strong. And we\u2019re starting to hear from some builders talking about their desire to actually bring that average price back down a little bit over the next year or two as they introduce new communities. And maybe they\u2019re a little bit further out or maybe the floor plans are a bit smaller. So should we think about that similarly with you guys? Are you actually kind of looking at that average price and kind of your standing in the marketplace and trying to actually bring that down on at least an absolute basis going forward? David Auld : Alan, we\u2019re always focused on affordability. And we talk entirely about a sustainable run rate in these communities and that involves not overpricing at any point in time. So \u2013 but yes, we\u2019re looking at product. We\u2019re looking at communities, land, how do we drive more and more efficiency into the process so that we can maintain a more affordable living cost. And then that\u2019s \u2013 to me, that\u2019s market scale as consistency and starts. It\u2019s \u2013 as we continue to drive market share gains, consolidate labor, we\u2019re in a better position to acquire land and it\u2019s just an ongoing continuous effort to get a little bit better every day. Alan Ratner : Makes a lot of sense. If I can sneak in one last one just on January. You and others have obviously highlighted very strong demand continue in January. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen any notable shifts in sentiment or activity across your price points given the uptick here in rates? Are you seeing maybe more discretionary buyers jumping in because their concerned rates are going to continue climbing, so like in your active adult business or Emerald? Or has the strength been pretty consistent with what you\u2019ve seen prior to this move? Mike Murray : Alan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen in the last month any real discernible difference. We still have more buyers in all of our markets than we have homes available. And so we are continuing to release those homes at a later stage of construction and so meeting that demand with the inventory as it gets to that point in its construction cycle. So hard to gauge whether it\u2019s a significant shift of any sort, and we still are seeing strong demand across all of our markets and across all demand basis. David Auld : All price points. Alan Ratner : Perfect. All right. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Alan. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Hey, everybody. Paul, I think you are the one who said this that you\u2019re working to stabilize and then reduce cycle times. Pragmatically, what specifically do you do to make that happen, given that builders are outsourcers effectively? And why and how do you do that better at Horton than, say, a peer would? David Auld : Carl, I think a lot of the things at Horton is just because we just work harder than other. Everybody works hard, but our people are just phenomenal problem solvers, and it\u2019s a part of the culture, the decentralized nature. I mean they take ownership and they saw problems. What we have tried to do is guide the divisions to understand the capacity within communities and consistently start homes to meet that capacity and when they do that, the capacity increases because the people in those communities get a little better at building those houses. And we\u2019re seeing that in \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the industry average is, but I got to believe we are completing homes even though it is not to our historical norm steel more rapidly than our peers out there. But it\u2019s a consistent starts, limited product, limited options, making it easier for these traits to get in and get out, reducing the SKUs that we\u2019re asking our suppliers to hold and, in some cases, ordering early. In some cases \u2013 I mean anything, everything that we can do to eliminate or break a bottleneck and the people in the field are doing. And I can tell you 100 stories, but I\u2019m not going to. Carl Reichardt : Fair enough. Thanks, David. And then I wanted to ask about lot count. You\u2019re over 550,000 under control now and the buildup spend significant, right? I mean, I think it was up 40% last year. So at some point, these lots got to come to market. So if you think about how they might, is this \u2013 you could have bigger communities going forward. You could have more communities going forward. In existing markets, you could have new markets. Can you sort of break out as you look at your lot position now sort of as you grow where those different elements fit into the long-term puzzle here, kind of bigger communities, more communities in existing markets, i.e., potentially more share or new markets? Thanks. Bill Wheat : Yes. D, all of the above. It will be\u2026 Carl Reichardt : I said that one already, but in terms of sort of the long-term split is kind of what I\u2019m asking. Bill Wheat : I don\u2019t know that we\u2019d see a big change in our long-term split. We are continually evaluating new markets. And at the same time, the mandate is to the teams in the field, aggregate your market share. We feel that local scale drives a lot of value in the business for us and the lot supply is a key part of it. I will tell you the frustration, it takes longer \u2013 just like it has to build a house, it takes longer to get a neighborhood approved. It takes longer to get lots built today than it did a year or two years ago. And so we\u2019re continuing to challenge that. So just like our housing supply has increased relative to our current delivery levels, our lot \u2013 controlled lot position has increased to support those lots coming on just taking longer to get into the finish line. Jessica Hansen : And our market count has continued to expand. So we\u2019re in 102 markets today. That\u2019s up just four markets sequentially. We continue to fill out kind of the more Midwestern Ohio Valley part of our footprint and continue to look at additional markets that would make sense to expand into as well. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, everybody. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So have a question on cancellations and interest rates, just given how low cancellations are at this point. I know you do those stress tests on the backlog and have talked about sort of flexing 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates. But I guess to what degree does the speed of rates rising coupled with these extended cycle times play into all that? I mean we had a 50 basis point rise in just four weeks. You got buyers in backlog that may have to wait several months at this point. So how do we think about risk to an uptick in cancellations here? Thank you. Bill Wheat : Well, I think as you look at those stress tests that we do, and we\u2019ve run it again and seeing a slight uptick in it, but still nominal and the interest rate increase we\u2019ve seen today have spurred further demand much more so than knock people out of qualification and ability to qualify. Jessica Hansen : And I think Mike mentioned earlier, but that\u2019s also part of the key to selling homes later in the construction cycle as they\u2019re not having to lock for longer or be worried about what an interest rate move does. So if we\u2019re selling closer to the time of completion and home closing, there\u2019s less risk in that regard as well. Matthew Bouley : Yes. Okay. Good. That makes sense. And then second one on the cycle times again. Maybe they improve at some point, maybe they don\u2019t. But assuming there\u2019s not a significant amount of new building products capacity coming online this year. Are there any structural changes you\u2019re making to the supply chain? Even if it\u2019s not possible in every single building material, is there anything you can do with more prefab packages? For example, I heard you say earlier, simplification of SKUs. And any of these changes you\u2019re making today, are they structural in nature? Or is it simply adjusting to whatever the market is at any point? Mike Murray : I think as David mentioned before, I mean, it\u2019s everything everywhere. We definitely empower our local business leaders to solve the bottlenecks that are unique to their market, and there are some that are broader in nature and our national purchasing team and regional purchasing teams do a great job of partnering with those manufacturers and our trade partners to give them more forward visibility to our expected demands and then help to understand how that product gets from point of manufacturer through distribution, kind of get the product that\u2019s being earmarked for us into the distribution chain through it on to our job sites when we need it. Not always a perfect process. We would certainly like it to be faster, but it\u2019s increased communication, simplification of product and a lot of anything we need to do market by market. Matthew Bouley : Great. Well, thank you for the color. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Auld : Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is, is thinking about the potential use for more incentives in the market \u2013 given the fact that the inventory is so low, do you think that the likelihood of us seeing any real meaningful increase there is actually much more \u2013 is actually much lower than it has been in the past. Do you think that we would need to see just a lot more on the ground in order for anything to meaningfully change? David Auld : I don\u2019t see any change in the incentives coming. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sure at some point, the inventory will catch up with demand. It is still significantly out of balance, especially if you\u2019re looking at the areas where the Florida, the Texas, the Arizonas, even across the Midwest where you have job growth and influx of people. It\u2019s \u2013 you never say never, but the difficulty of getting lots on the ground and then getting houses built is \u2013 it\u2019s going to be very difficult to catch up with demand anytime in the next couple of years. Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Mike Murray : Susan, you touched on it with the level of inventory out there, the use of incentives. I think you\u2019d have to see a significant increase in the level of unsold inventories, especially unsold completed inventories. And today, we\u2019re at 1,000 unsold completed homes at the end of December, very low for us this time of the year to be carrying that few homes. Susan Maklari : Right. Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is, thinking about the operational pressures in the industry, even if the supply chain on the material side does eventually catch up and things there normalized, do you think that we could be facing an overall tighter labor environment and construction relative to where we were before COVID? And if so, how do you think about your ability to overcome that and continue to increase the level of production that you can deliver? David Auld : It goes back to market scale and even within submarkets being able to control a labor base and keeping them busy, keeping them in the same location. I just can\u2019t over \u2013 I can\u2019t oversell that advantage where you\u2019ve got a program where we\u2019re releasing 15, 20, 30 houses every month, month after month after month after month. The aggregation of labor in those kinds of communities is \u2013 it\u2019s very advantageous in today\u2019s world. And it also gives you the ability to kind of direct some of that labor through the two or three or four or five a month absorption communities. So it\u2019s market scale. It\u2019s \u2013 again, everything that we\u2019ve done, simplifying the product, trying to maintain affordability and then having well-located communities with long running times, so. Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Good luck. David Auld : Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Susan. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. David Auld : Good morning. Eric Bosshard : A couple of things. First of all, the outlook on costs, if you could just provide some clarity on where that goes and especially, trying to figure out the movement in lumber, how that is flowing through? Where were trough lumber and where the lumber impact goes going forward, especially on the cost side? Jessica Hansen : Sure. So I\u2019ll start with lumber and then somebody else can chime in on the rest of our cost structure. Lumber costs have remained really volatile as I know you\u2019re aware. We have had some opportunities to purchase at costs that were well below the peaks we saw, I guess, last spring and into the summer. However, those reductions in prices lasted a shorter period of time than we really expected and really probably hoped and lumber has been on the rise again for the last few months. So there\u2019s been other supply chain delays that also caused the volatility in lumber prices. We do hope that we\u2019ll see a mix that leans towards slightly lower costs in Q2, which is baked into our Q2 gross margin guide for flat to slightly up gross margins, but then we do expect our lumber cost to trend back up in our closing starting in Q3. And other costs? Mike Murray : It\u2019s kind of a mixed bag, but we would generally be seeing slight cost pressures in most places and so that\u2019s been offset by price increases, I think. Some of the lumber relief we should see in Q2, early Q3, will help with some of that as well, but as Jessica mentioned, lumber prices have gone back up, and so those will be flowing through closings later this fiscal year. Jessica Hansen : And really with home prices continue to increase, I mean, generally, all costs typically follow. And so we really wouldn\u2019t expect to see much in the way of cost relief until you see some sort of slowdown in home price appreciation. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, it seems like just a math equation, but I know there\u2019s more to it than that. But the incremental \u2013 the modest increase in the revenue guide for the year with the same deliveries, it appears that it\u2019s just looking at price and extrapolating that out, but what else were the considerations and taking a bit more optimistic position on the full year revenue growth, especially in front of the selling season? Bill Wheat : Yes, Eric, it really is just an extrapolation of where we see prices now. We\u2019ve got a few more months of visibility into our selling prices and where our closing prices moved up to in Q1 and what our visibility is going into Q2 that we feel like the sales prices that are baked in and that we have visibility to that justified increasing, a pretty nice increase in our annual revenue guide. But obviously, with the continued challenges on the supply chain, construction cycle times elongating, we didn\u2019t really feel like we had any more room on the volume side as of yet. So it\u2019s really solely priced, and we feel good about that guidance for the year. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich with Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, it\u2019s Rafe. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. David Auld : Good morning. Rafe Jadrosich : I wanted to just start on the rental business. Can you talk a little bit about the returns you\u2019re targeting in the rental business? And how that could compare to homebuilding longer-term? And then will you be targeting different markets in the rental business compared to the homebuilding segment? Mike Murray : So Rafe, what we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re growing that business pretty aggressively, and we\u2019ve been very pleased with actually the returns that, that business is produced on a trailing 12-month basis. The profits that segments generated relative to its inventory investment have been about 20% and that\u2019s in a heavy growth ramp. So we would expect to see that continue to increase, especially when we get to have more of the projects delivering on a more consistent basis. And I would say that the markets we seek to serve with that, it\u2019s going to line up very well with our homebuilding for sale footprint as well. We\u2019ve seen a lot of markets accept the product very well, and the investor base very excited about those projects as well. Rafe Jadrosich : And then on \u2013 in terms of the pace of your home starts, obviously, the average ticked up a lot in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, I think about $1,000 a month. What\u2019s allowing you to increase that pace sequentially? And then how should we think about that going forward? Paul Romanowski : Yes. I think that that\u2019s in line with our plans and what we have set forth across all of our divisions and communities. We target an absorption pace per community plan well ahead to make sure that we have those permits in hand and lots in front of us. It\u2019s not easier today to put lots on the ground any more than it is easier to build a home, but we have incredible operators in the field who stay ahead of this and it\u2019s allowed us to continually sequentially quarter-over-quarter increase our start pace and that\u2019s a cadence that we hope to continue. The real key to our ability to do that is our lot position, having that long lot position controlled and strong supplier relationships on will and the developer side puts our operators and positions to continue to start and increase our start base. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Dahl with RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-ups here, and maybe first one ties into the last one a little bit, but the order guidance for your fiscal 2Q being flat to low-single digits. It seems like you\u2019ve been pretty successful getting some inventory rebuild both sequentially and year-on-year. Your comps get a little easier in 2Q versus 1Q. So can you just talk about the moving pieces on that order guide? And why there can be some upside there? Mike Murray : I think we\u2019re still seeing a restriction on sales relative to where the inventory is getting to in production. So we\u2019re still waiting to sell the homes closer to the delivery date, and so that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s really the real driver is on our sales expectation. Our comp is still up against a 35% increase last year in the second quarter. It does certainly get to be a much easier comp in Q3 and Q4 this year from a sales perspective. Mike Dahl : Got it. Okay. And my second question, I wanted to follow-up on one of Steve\u2019s questions from earlier around kind of rentals being potentially a backstop for sale because it\u2019s kind of an interesting concept, especially as you scale that side of your business and the partnerships you have with buyers of those assets. And so if the idea is, at some point in time, if for-sale demand were to slow, there could be an institutional buyer that would be looking at additional communities that you may have currently built as for sale, but someone may want to buy wholesale and turn to rentals. Can you talk a little bit more about how you would view opportunities like that? And I know the economics and the returns can look very different so maybe just even conceptually, what it would have to take in terms of what the moving pieces around the return dynamics, if you were to look at bulk sale in our community that was not intended for bulk sale at some point in the future? David Auld : Yes. Mike, I\u2019ve always \u2013 we\u2019ve always believed that the rental platform when we get it built out will derisk our land portfolio because it does give us another lever. But from a just a philosophical standpoint, we believe in the fore sale business. We believe home ownership in the country is very important. Today, our goal is to deliver more homes because the demand is there, and it\u2019s hard to believe, five years from now, homes are going to be more affordable than they are today. So every family we can get in the home, we feel like we \u2013 is a win for us and for that family. When we look at the risk in the rental platform, the ability to scale that up, the segment that\u2019s going to create \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a real business all on its own. And because of the geographic platform and the embedded divisions within that geography, our ability to scale that and touch every market is \u2013 we see as just great opportunity for our shareholders and for our people internally. Mike Dahl : Okay. Thanks, Dave. David Auld : You bet. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Ken, your line is live. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. David Auld : Hey, Ken. Ken Zener : You guys were better because you paid for your own phones. I have two simple questions. One, obviously, with insatiable demand, how you guys are approaching the cycle time in construction? Basically, it looks like your investments in your inventory units are slowing, right? Cycle time is up 5% sequentially. You guys rose inventory 14%. Is that pretty much the move that you guys will pursue into the second half if the cycle times continue to compress that you\u2019ll just throw more units into the ground to compensate for that slower cycle time? David Auld : We have start targets and we talk about consistent sustainable starts driving ultimately sales and closings, and it\u2019s based on the capacity within divisions to deliver those homes. Ken Zener : Okay. That\u2019s fine. I mean it seems to me that\u2019s the way you\u2019re approaching it. And I guess, realizing these conference call is long already, David, could you just \u2013 we spoke about this in the past, the interest rate you paid on your first home. You highlighted obviously the very strong demand, strong job growth. Can you guys just comment \u2013 I mean we recently wrote about it, but can you comment on the fact with your perspective about your comfort with the real rates being negative now compared to when you took your first mortgage rate? Just as a kind of a broad thought. Appreciate it. David Auld : It\u2019s a great time. Housing is more affordable today than it certainly was in the 1980s. The ability to get into a house, lock down your homeownership or your housing cost for the next 20 years is a significant driving force in what\u2019s going on because as overall cost inflation, interest rates, as those continue to move up, the people that have bought a house today, even if it\u2019s at a price that\u2019s 15%, 20% higher than it was last year, are \u2013 I mean it\u2019s just a great thing. So the other thing, Ken, that we really don\u2019t talk much about, but it\u2019s \u2013 when I was 20, I mean that was just \u2013 that was what was expected. You figured out a way to buy a house and that became less cool for use of a stupid term, as the millennials came into their 20s. But what I\u2019m seeing and what my millennial daughter is telling me is, now it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big part of the narrative on social media is, it\u2019s \u2013 people want to own homes again. And it\u2019s just \u2013 I think I\u2019m amazed sometimes at some of the conversations around housing and I look at what it was and look at what it is. I look at the \u2013 just the demographic demand that\u2019s out there, I look at the wealth effect of everything that\u2019s happened over the last 10 years and the American public is. They\u2019re in a good place, and from an affordability standpoint, home ownership is better than it was in the 1980s. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m very optimistic about this company, and I\u2019m just in all of our people and how \u2013 what they are accomplishing out there, so. Ken Zener : Thank you. David Auld : I don\u2019t know if I answer your question, but I thought you got it I think. Ken Zener : All is clear. Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Okay. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions here. So David, just want to follow-up on one of your prior comments about the public scanning market share, and I know it might be difficult to generalize, but I\u2019m hoping to understand what you\u2019re hearing on the ground from local operators regarding some of your private builder competitors. Are they expecting their home inventory to jump significantly through 2022, expecting strong activity or strong active land or community count growth? Or are you expecting more of the same of a pretty constrained environment for your private builder peers? And I\u2019m also asking this in light that you won\u2019t make up 10% plus of the market, you all had really nice order growth in the quarter. But when you look at new home sales in the fourth quarter, it was down more than 20% plus. So I\u2019m really hoping you can help us think through this as we move through 2022. David Auld : We actually were talking about this and getting ready for the call. The private builders and even some of the smaller public builders are going to have very difficult time delivering houses. I mean we\u2019re having \u2013 it is hard for us. I mean it\u2019s probably harder to complete and finish a house today as it\u2019s been in my career in homebuilding. And as these private guys who don\u2019t have our scale, who don\u2019t have our ability to driver result, their houses are setting and that\u2019s going to cut off their access to the next house they start. Anecdotally, we are talking to the builders end markets, they\u2019re just tired. They don\u2019t \u2013 they\u2019ve got six, seven, eight banks. They\u2019re sideways with two of them, and they\u2019re looking to us to take out their log supply and they maybe become a developer for us in that market. So it\u2019s \u2013 if the supply chains don\u2019t loosen up, I think you\u2019re going to see the consolidation accelerate in the market by the big box because what is the big constraint on the market on housing is the ability to get lots in front of you. And the private guys, they don\u2019t have that ability that publics do and that\u2019s \u2013 so when you look at new home sales decline, that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with demand, that has to be built \u2013 60% of the homes being built out, they\u2019re being built by non-public. And I think all of this cycle, you\u2019re going to see that group\u2019s ability to start houses continue to deteriorate and that is going to get picked up by the public. Even if the overall housing market \u2013 new home housing market declines, I think the top 10 [indiscernible] are going to pick up market share and they\u2019re going to continue to grow. So that\u2019s what happening. Truman Patterson : Okay. Interesting. There\u2019s clearly been a lot of discussion with the Fed likely raising rates this year. We can debate what sort of impact that might have on demand versus lack of supply and everything, but hypothetically, let\u2019s say, demand does soften, which consumer segment do you all think holds up relatively better between entry-level, move-up, luxury, active adult? And are there any geographies that you all think might underperform? Jessica Hansen : This is \u2013 probably, I know somewhat of a contrarian view the way the market. Sometimes it reacts to entry-level builders, but we generally continue to think about an entry-level buyer as a buyer out of need rather than discretion. So although as prices continue to rise and/or rates are to increase and affordability gets negatively impacted, you do lose a subset of entry-level buyers that can qualify from. We do expect over the long-term that to continue to be the lion\u2019s share of the demand, which is why we continue to focus on affordability, because as I said, those buyers are buying out of need. Whereas the further the price curve you go, that\u2019s a more discretionary buyer, maybe a little bit more financially savvy that is more focused on timing of an interest rate versus just an absolute monthly payment. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : In the interest of time, your final question is coming from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa, your line is live. Deepa Raghavan : Hi, thanks very much for squeezing me in. A couple ones for me. So let me ask on the affordability issue. We look at trends, it just doesn\u2019t correlate to the concern that\u2019s out there on affordability. And Dave, like you pointed out, rates are still historically low and it looks like we could end up having the whole \u2013 the industry, the homebuilders could end up having good pricing power this year, too. My question is, is the affordability issue being raised too ahead of its time? Or do you believe 2022 or 2023 can be structurally impaired or impacted from some buyers being priced out in this continually tight imbalanced environment? Mike Murray : As we\u2019ve seen in our sales offices and demand, we\u2019re not seeing people being priced out to can be read today, and we\u2019re generally focused at a price point lower than most of our competitors in the markets that we serve. What I would say is that going forward, you see very good household income growth inflation is certainly out there. It\u2019s across the board and as someone touched on before. We could be at negative real interest rates to own a home, so it\u2019s a very powerful economic decision to go ahead and buy a house today and lock in that interest rate relative to current inflation expectations. So still feel very good about the demand we\u2019re seeing into 2022. Hard to predict much beyond that because you just don\u2019t know, but we do like what we see in 2022 for sure. Deepa Raghavan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Dave, when we met you last summer, you mentioned expanding in Ohio Valley in parts of Midwest as newer markets. But can you talk through what\u2019s the economic engine that will drive job growth there? It\u2019s hard for us to conceive that post COVID with people decided to pack their bags and move to Ohio just because they can work remotely. David Auld : Yes. There is a big population base there now. You\u2019ve got some of the best universities in the country that are there. You\u2019re seeing a migration out of what we\u2019ve historically been the tech areas and/or the think tank areas, financial areas into these incubators, which are these major universities. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m a big believer that long-term, the quality of life, just the access to really smart people is going to drive companies and grow companies into these markets. You see it in Austin. You see it in Nashville, Columbus. It\u2019s just across Indianapolis. There are brilliant people starting what are going to be great big companies that that find that that environment just a better place to be than some of the what has historically been high tech, high income markets. And the population of the U.S., it \u2013 those towns, those cities are great cities, and they offer a lot and that\u2019s what... Deepa Raghavan : All right. Thanks \u2013 yeah. Thanks very much. Appreciate the color and good luck. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Auld for any closing comments. David Auld : Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speak with you in our second quarter results in April and our the D.R. Horton family, outstanding first quarter. It\u2019s amazing what\u2019s the \u2013 our people are accomplishing it there, and Don Horton and the entire executive team are humbled with the opportunity to represent you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are have been placed on a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions and comments after the presentation. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Holly, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K and it\u2019s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next day or two. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. D.R. Horton team delivered an outstanding second quarter, highlighted by a, 59% [ph] increase in earnings to $4.03 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 60% to $1.9 billion on a 24% increase in revenues. And our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 520 basis points to 23.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 40.3%, and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 34%. These results reflect our experienced teams, the production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong despite the recent increase in mortgage rates and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to aggregate market share. There are still significant challenges in the supply chain, including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market. Our construction cycle times were extended further this quarter, and we continue to work on stabilizing and then reducing our cycle times to historical norms. After starting construction on 24,800 homes this quarter, our homes and inventory increased 30% from year ago with only 600 unsold completed homes across the nation. With 33,900 homes in backlog, 59,800 homes in inventory, a robust loss supply and strong trade and supplier relationships, we are well-positioned for consolidated revenue growth of greater than 25% this year. We believe our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage position us to operate effectively through changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations, while managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace, and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 59% to $4.03 per diluted share compared to $2.53 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 55% to $1.4 billion compared to $930 million. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 22% to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed, up from $6.2 billion on 19,701 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,200, up 21% from the prior year quarter, while the average size of our homes closed was down 1%. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Our net sales orders in the second quarter decreased 10% to 24,340 homes, while the value increased 10% from the prior year to $9.7 billion. Our average number of active selling communities increased 1% from the prior year quarter and was up 4% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $400,600, up 23% from the prior year quarter. The cancellation rate for the second quarter was 16% compared to 15% in the prior year quarter. New home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates. We are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to the start of home construction. We expect to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner for the rest of the year. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 28.9%, up 150 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The increase in our gross margin for December to March reflects the broad strength of the housing market. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 4.8% sequentially. While stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.5% and our lot cost increased 2.8%. We expect our cost will continue to increase. However, with the strength of today's market conditions, we expect most cost pressures to be offset by price increases in the near-term. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be slightly better than the second quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the second quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.8%, down 80 basis points from 7.6% in the prior year quarter. This quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any quarter in our history, and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A, while ensuring that our infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 24,800 homes during the quarter, up 5% from the second quarter last year, bringing our trailing 12-month starts to 95,300 homes. We ended the quarter with 59,800 homes in inventory, up 30% from a year ago. 26,000 of our total homes at March 31st were unsold, of which only 600 were completed. Our average construction cycle times for homes closed in the second quarter increased by almost two weeks since our first quarter and over two months from a year ago. Although we have not seen improvement in the supply chain yet, we continue working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms. Mike? Mike Murray : At March 31st, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 570,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. 23% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.1 billion, of which $1.2 billion was for finished lots, $630 million was for land development and $260 million was to acquire land. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company continues to execute well. During the second quarter, Forestar reported total revenues of $421.6 million, and pre-tax income of $63.2 million. For the full year, Forestar expects to deliver 19,500 to 20,000 lots, and generate $1.7 billion of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 14% to 14.5%. At March 31, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position increased 14% from a year ago to 96,500 lives. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $390 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton, and had approximately $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.9%. Forestar's strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton positions them to continue their profitable growth. Bill?? Bill Wheat : Financial services pre-tax income in the second quarter was $92.8 million with a pre-tax profit margin of 41.8%, compared to $107.7 million and 47.8% in the prior year quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes close by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 68% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $103 million on revenues of $223 million in the second quarter. During the quarter, we sold one multifamily rental property consisting of 126 units for $50 million, and we sold three single-family rental properties totaling 368 homes for $173 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $1.5 billion, compared to $544 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at March 31st included approximately $600 million of multifamily rental properties and $900 million of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories. During the quarter, our rental operations subsidiary, DRH Rental, entered into a four-year $750 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Availability under the rental revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on unrestricted cash and the book value of DRH rental real estate assets. There were no borrowings outstanding on the rental credit facility at quarter end. We now expect our rental operations to generate more than $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. Our third quarter rental sales will be lower than the second quarter and fourth quarter sales will be the highest of the year. We also now expect our total rental platform inventories to grow by more than $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 based on current projects in development and a significant pipeline of our future projects. We are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits and returns in future years. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic. At March 31st, we had $3.2 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 16.4% at the end of March and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 11.3%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 18.9%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $16.8 billion and book value per share was $47.66, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 34% compared to 27.1% a year ago. During the first six months of the year, our cash used in homebuilding operations was $416 million, which reflects our increased homes and inventory to meet demand and the impact of extended construction cycle-times. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $266 million during the quarter for a total of 5.8 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $544.2 million, an increase of 30% compared to the same period a year ago. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. We now expect to reduce our outstanding share count by 3% during fiscal 2022. We remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward to the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect market conditions to continue to reflect strong demand from homebuyers with continuing supply chain challenges. We expect to generate consolidated revenues in our June quarter of $8.6 billion to $9 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 21,500 and 22,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be in the range of 29% to 29.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be around 6.6%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of approximately 40% and we expect our income tax rate to be roughly 24% in the third quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of $35.3 billion to $36.1 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range of 88,000 to 90,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of roughly 24%, and we now expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 3% at the end of fiscal 2022, compared to the end of fiscal 2021. We still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year, and we will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, increasing our rental inventories, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to continue aggregating market share and effectively operating in changing economic conditions. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to invest the capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well-positioned to continue growing and improving our operations during the remainder of 2022 and in future years. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks very much. Morning everybody. I think at the end of -- or in January, you talked about orders being flat, maybe up slightly in the quarter. They were down 10. Can you talk a little bit about the progression of orders over the course of the quarter? And when I'm assuming you recognize that the production side was not catching up and in fact, was deteriorating and you decided to slow order pace, or is there a demand component to this as well? Mike Murray : Carl, I think it was all our decision to slow sales orders based on production capacity. I think we saw and continue to see very good demand and more buyers, qualified buyers out there for our homes today when we release them for sale. But we did see during the quarter that our cycle times continue to extend, and we made the decision in several of our geographies to delay the release of homes until we could give a better delivery date to those customers and provide a better experience for them in the backlog process. So we saw a very strong demand in the quarter, but we did see the cycle times elongate. I think we added two weeks this quarter, unfortunately, and we wanted to make sure we did not create more buyers in backlog with an unhappy experience. Carl Reichardt : Great. Thanks Mike. And then you didn't discuss the Vidler Water transaction, and I would just like you to give an overview of the strategic rationale for that deal and whether or not this is a function of the assets related to water rights or if this is a business that you think potentially could grow? Thanks very much. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Carl. We put out pretty much what we're going to say about Vidler in the press release in terms of the owning a portfolio of premium on rights and other water-related assets across several of our Southwest markets that generally lack adequate supply. We mentioned the total value of the transaction approximately $290 million and we do expect it to close in the next month or two. But considering it's subject to the successful completion of a tender offer, we don't have much to say at this time and I look forward to talking about that in coming quarters after it closes. Carl Reichardt : Well I tried. Thanks Jess, thanks everybody. Operator : Your next question is coming from John Lovallo with UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning guys and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is activity at some point will likely moderate given higher rates and higher prices. And the question I have and I think the concern that some investors have is that if and when activity does moderate, how does this sort of change, if at all, your thoughts on capital allocation? I mean, will you sort of back off on -- take the foot off the pedal on buying land and maybe switch more towards share buybacks and things of that nature? Bill Wheat : Thanks John. We're always focused on aggregating market share and we're positioning ourselves to continue to do that through any economic cycle. Certainly, at some point, impact of rates and impact of affordability will have some impact on demand, and we certainly will adjust our capital allocation at that time. But we believe we're in a strong position to continue to grow. But certainly, those impacts on demand would impact our investment decisions in land at that point in time. John Lovallo : Okay, that's good to hear. And then on the option percentage getting up to 77%, I mean, that's much higher than think anyone thought it when the Forestar acquisition occurred and seeming going back a few years ago. I mean could this get much closer to, call it, 90% and that's just a random number, but just 90% plus, getting closer to what MVR does and how does this impact the strategy with Forestar, as its grown and become spread across a lot of your communities? I mean you do have the option to bring that ownership position down pretty significantly and still maintain the favorable contract terms. So, just curious how you're thinking about Forestar longer term? David Auld : From the overall auction lot percentage, we have been focused on it. We're going to continue to focus on it. There is -- obviously, it's going to be capped at 100%. But our goal is just to continue to get better and more efficient. And as to Forestar, very happy with Forestar. I mean -- at some point, yes, it will deconsolidate. But there's still a lot of markets that we think we can help scale Forestar into and if you look at just the earnings we're making, our shareholders are making of Forestar. It's a very good investment and kind of not a bad place to be -- but yes, at some point, it will deconsolidate, but it's more geared toward their platform build-out than it is our desire to liquidate some percentage of our shares. John Lovallo : Thanks guys. Jessica Hansen : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Stephen Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Obviously, with the big rise in rates, everyone's concerned that things are going to slow. I think John mentioned that that's people's expectations. I guess, two questions with respect to the rise in rates. One is, is there anything that you are planning in terms of the communities, which would likely come online in the next year or two, let's say, the next year, new communities opening. Where you're making adjustments to your planned home sizes, amenity levels or anything like that? And would that have an impact on the gross margin? And then secondly, can you just talk about why do you think we have not seen in your communities despite, obviously, affordability of being more judged. Why do you think we haven't seen it yet in terms of your conversations with customers, do you -- are they -- can you talk about the role of rate locks, or just anything that would be helpful for understanding why we maybe haven't seen anything yet? David Auld : Stephen, I think to your first question, in terms of community design, plan design, I think we are going to continue to focus the affordable range and work towards those buyers. I don't see a significant change in how we build, what we bill. But if it continues to be a push on affordability, then we'll put the appropriate homes in place. It may mean some smaller homes, but not a significant shift from where we are today. In terms of -- in our communities and in our sales offices, certainly, there is a concern from the buying public over rates, but selling later in the process like we do. We don't have as much exposure as we could if we were selling far out to the shifts and rate conditions. And that's why we've continued to restrict our sales to a later time frame, so that we're putting people in backlog at closer to the rate that they're going to close at. Stephen Kim : That makes a lot of sense. In this quarter, can you give us a sense for how many of your closings were done with a rate lock that the closings I'm referring to, not the orders? Jessica Hansen : Yes. So I looked at it actually on a forward-looking basis, and we have essentially our next month, so April, 100% locked. And then as you would expect, that percentage ticks down, but it's the majority of the quarter's closing that are locked and you got to get to four-plus months out before that's a more de minimis percentage. Stephen Kim : Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Ivy, your line is live. Ivy Zelman : Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the strong results. Maybe you guys can just give us some perspective on the rental business with both the merchant build single-family rental communities as well as your multifamily projects. Can you talk about how many of them you're developing them are already pre-sold. And have you seen any changes in valuation as it relates to selling with the surge in rates as we hear chatter that values at least within multifamily have really started to be pressured. And just the overall buying appetite that's out there with so much capital still appears to be chasing this asset class? Mike Murray : Thank you, Ivy. We do see a lot of very strong demand and strong execution on the pricing; we do not sell any of our communities at this point during the development phase. We're selling them at -- in the lease-up phase at stabilization. So, we're seeing still very good demand and very good pricing execution on those transactions that we have closed on. So, current outlook, you would expect cap rates could be affected by rising interest rates, but we're also seeing very strong leasing demand and very strong rental growth, which certainly affect cap rate outlooks. Jessica Hansen : And at a 40% to 50%-plus margin on these sales if the market were to soften a bit, we still expect to generate very strong profits and returns. Ivy Zelman : Great. And then just secondly, with respect to the delay in and obviously, the industry is impacted. Can you walk us through on the development side with municipalities, like components of the overall impact is related to like the difference versus sourcing materials because some materials are not a problem anymore. So, everyone talks about it's a whack-a-mole, but what's it like on the development side as well as on the municipality side and how much of that is impacting the two-month year-over-year increase in cycle-time? Mike Murray : Well, I think you've got certainly municipality challenges through the entitlement process in terms of bringing new lots to the market. And we still haven't seen full return of municipalities when you're talking about permitting and/or inspection process. So, it certainly is impacting some of that as we work through the supply chain challenges and then you finally move homes on to the next stage, it is -- we do see some delays in inspections and some of the municipality services that we were seeing. So, it's certainly been part of the impact to our cycle time extension. Ivy Zelman : And let me just sneak in 1 last one, if I could. Just with respect to the inflation that we've seen. Can you be more specific on recognizing your land is predominantly controlled via option. Like what has changed on the pricing lot of inflation that you are buying outright? Are you seeing relative to a year ago? And maybe to be just general because it's obviously different by market. David Auld : I'd say the overall land market as track the sales price of homes. So, it is good to be in a position where we control 550,000 lots at prices contracted two years ago, three years ago, four years ago and not be in a position today where we have to go buy something. So, we are looking at that. We're monitoring it. I believe liquidity is going to drive market share gains and the ability to not be at risk of credit markets and/or banks is a huge competitive advantage for us and we're going to protect that. We're going to be conservative in our land searches there are good deals out there that we put under contract this year that we will take to close. But we are not in a position where we have to go buy anything. And we're going to, I think, see a significant benefit of that as we proceed through this market. Ivy Zelman : Thank you. Good luck. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Matthew your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Just another question on what you medium term perspective from what you can control in a scenario where housing activity were to slow, as we're talking about this morning, what does D.R. Horton do from a supply perspective? To what degree does your own plans for community replenishment or starts flex with these changes in interest rates and demand, just thinking again medium-term annual volume growth? How should we think about how you all are viewing that? Thank you. Mike Murray : Matt, we're very much a bottom-up community level driven company, and we're going to evaluate demand we see at each individual community and submarket and look for home starts to match that demand that our local operators are seeing. And that couples with community replacement needs in those submarkets based upon demand we see in real-time in the field. So in the near term, we'll continue to adjust starts. In the more medium term, we'll look at subdivision openings and phase sizing. And then as well as Paul touched on before, we may be adjusting some product to some smaller sizes, if that's appropriate for the given market. Matthew Bouley : Got you. Okay. That's very helpful. And then secondly, just zooming in back to the very near-term, I think you've seen maybe in some of the housing data, maybe a little bit in our own survey work, it seems like some trends in the housing market might have become a little more choppy in recent weeks, perhaps not surprising given the move in interest rates. But just anything you're seeing on the leading edge, on the margin whether that's any sort of pockets of changes in demand or again, incentives appearing and various markets? Just anything you're seeing later into March and into April? Thank you. David Auld : The rate increase is -- it's eliminating some people from the home buy experience. But we still have more people qualify buyers trying to buy homes than we can produce today. One of the things that really, I think, has impressed me back in 2018 when you saw a rapid rise in rates, demand just was significantly reduced. And then after the rate shock to -- after the rate shock was mitigated, we saw demand come back and come back strong. But through this cycle, which is in even more rapid rate increases, yes, we've had people that don't qualify anymore, but the demand side is still very strong. So just the desire to own homes, and it may be the fact that prices have escalated very fast and rents are escalating even faster than the price of new homes and all the talk about inflation and then locking in your housing costs for 20 years. I mean, it is -- home ownership is a cherished thing today. And the people coming out of the -- millennials coming out or even individuals relocating from other markets to where the growth is taking place. Its just they want to own a home, they want to lock in their housing cost, and they want to get in the neighborhoods that they can raise families in. Matthew Bouley : Well, thank you for that David, and thanks everyone, and good luck. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Cancellation rates, I guess, picked up a 100 bps, maybe from record low levels. Would you characterize that as more kind of noise or maybe more clearly, customers no longer able to secure mortgages? Would you expect cancellations maybe decline again in 3Q if rates stay at their current level? And I think in the past, you've provided kind of a sensitivity analysis around sort of mid-single-digit, high single-digit backlog that potentially could be at risk with 100 bp rise in rates. Any sort of thoughts on how that has shaken out now that we're above 5% now on rates? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Anthony. I mean we look at a 1% change in our cancellation rate is essentially flat. It's still abnormally low -- historically low. We typically run in the high teens to low 20s. And that's a can rate we're very comfortable running at. The main reason continues to be that buyers can't ultimately qualify for the home purchase. So, that 15%, 16%, 17% wherever it falls out each quarter, really no concerns from us on that end. In terms of rate sensitivity analysis, we did run the same sensitivity as we've talked to each of the last few quarters. I think rates have already kind of run up to where that was run at a couple of weeks ago, as we prepped for this call, but it had only ticked up to, call it, roughly 10% of buyers and backlog today would be at risk. As I mentioned earlier in answer to another question, all of April is already rate locked if they're going through a mortgage company. So, that piece wouldn't be at risk. And then we also would work to look to move people from a different loan product or see if they could document additional income. And then to kind of second some things that the guys have already said today, for those buyers that do unfortunately fall out because they can't qualify, there's no shortage of buyers behind them to take their place. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. And then just with higher rates, are you making any strategic shifts to target a different mix of buyers? Are you seeing buyers that you wouldn't normally talk to kind of moving down market to more affordable offerings and understanding your entire offering is fairly affordable, like which of your buyer types do you think is best positioned to maybe weather rising rates, does it move up, or any thoughts there? Mike Murray : We really haven't made any significant shift and don't see a need to as rates rise. It's going to be more of that shock to payment for folks when they have to reset maybe the size home or price that they can then qualify for. So, we're going to catch those people that have been buying up that may fall down the price curve and/or size of home and still be able to pick them up in a majority of our communities. So, no real shift in what we're doing with any of our buyer demographics. We're still seeing strong demand, as everyone's mentioned, across the spectrum. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut with JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live. Mike Rehaut : Hi thanks. Good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to revisit the can rate, which I think as you mentioned, Jessica, essentially flat and extremely low. We've kind of thought of it as a key metric to understand the potential impact of the rate move over the last 60, 90 days. And I was curious if you've seen any change throughout the quarter, Obviously, it was up 100 basis points versus a year ago, and I think 100 basis points, I believe, sequentially. But anything throughout the quarter that maybe perhaps you ended the quarter at a higher number than at the beginning. And if there's been any change in April, curious around that. Jessica Hansen : It really was relatively flat throughout the quarter, give or take, a 1% change. So sequentially, we were -- I guess, we were both a year ago and in the last quarter, we were at 15%. This quarter, we were at 16%, and it was right around that range for the duration of the court. Mike Rehaut : Okay. Also, throughout the quarter, you said that demand has remained strong, more demand than supply. I would presume then that as a result, your pricing power and the incentives that you've had in the marketplace really haven't changed at all. Obviously, your gross margins continue to improve. And you expect further margin improvement in the third quarter. Just wanted to make sure that was the case as well and it was the case for yourselves as well as if you witnessed any changes in the broader marketplace? Bill Wheat : Mike, we have seen consistent ability to raise prices through the quarter, seeing consistent increases in our sales order pricing that then flow through our backlog and through our closing pricing. That's what gives us the confidence to say that our margins are going to be slightly better next quarter, because we can see those sales prices coming through in our closings in the next quarter. So to date, we have not seen a change in our ability to raise prices. I think naturally as we look a little bit longer term with the impact of rates and impact of overall price increases. At some point, we would expect that to moderate. But at this point, we have not seeing any signs that as of yet. Mike Rehaut : Okay. One last quick one, if I could. Just the 3% reduction of year-end share count versus 2% previously. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but I just want to make sure, is that a function of a greater amount of dollars dedicated to share repurchase or in part driven by the recent reduction in share price in the market over the last couple of months? Bill Wheat : A little bit of both, Mike. As we look at our capital allocation for the year, our expectations for how much we would utilize, I mean dollars we would utilize a share repurchase has gone up versus our prior estimates. But then certainly, the current valuation of our stock does allow us to buy more shares per dollar as well. And so it's a little bit of both, and that's allowed us to increase our estimate from 2% reduction to a 3% reduction. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow-up on one of John's questions previously. I realize that cycle times have been extended, you have 60,000 homes under construction, which ties up net working capital. But we're now halfway through the year. I'm just hoping you can give an update or possibly a number around your 2022 operating cash flow expectation. And then just on the capital allocation decision based on rate increasing, it seems like you're going to be a bit more -- or you're going to continue with programmatic share repurchase. But how do you balance this with potentially even increasing liquidity given all the commentary from the Fed and possibly having a rainy day fund, if you will? Bill Wheat : Yes, it is a constant balance, Truman. We're not giving specific dollar guidance regarding our operating cash flow other than we do expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations. On a consolidated basis, our operating cash flow also includes the investments we're making in our rental platform, which obviously are significant, increasing those by $1.5 billion this year. And then certainly one factor today that is tying up some of our capital is the extension of our build being longer than two months longer than a year ago, certainly does tie up a significant amount of capital. But certainly, we are working towards stabilizing that and improving those cycle times, which we would expect to start to bring that cash back some towards the end of fiscal 2022 and then certainly into fiscal 2023. So, it is a balance -- and as we plan our capital allocation, we plan our liquidity targets, we are just seeking to make sure we stay in as a strong and flexible position as possible to handle the -- what we see in the market today and position ourselves for further growth, aggregation and market share and generating returns to our shareholders. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thanks for that. And then one final one on just current market conditions. Just are you seeing any metros that are maybe a little bit slower than the others? And then for the buyers purchasing today, I realize this might be somewhat of an unfair question, but how long have they been in the market? Were they really searching before rates started to move, or are we seeing incremental buyers continuing to come in after the higher rate environment that are kind of more recently entered, if you will. Mike Murray : Truman, I think on the markets, we see markets have varying levels of performance and demand, but they're all very strong. relative to where they've been. I mean certainly, the migration patterns within the country and the areas that are gaining population have incredibly strong demand, but markets across our footprint, we still see more buyer demand than we have production capacity for today. And so we're still very encouraged by that. Some of those buyers have been in the marketplace for quite a while. Others are more recent entries, but we don't have any hard data we could share with you on how exactly long they've been conducting their search. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you. And good luck in the upcoming year. Mike Murray : Thanks. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo. Deepa, your line is live. Deepa Raghavan : Thanks everyone for taking the question. Good morning. Of the supply chain incremental headwinds, is there a way to think about how much we're Omicron-related? I'm assuming that should be probably behind us now and how much is kind of carry forward? I think where I'm going with it is, are you baking in any sequential improvement off of that two weeks elongated cycle time assuming there must have been some relief from Omicron? Jessica Hansen : Yes, I think we would agree with you on the Omicron front. I mean there's certainly still labor challenges in labor and manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, it's still harder to come by, but it does seem to be slightly improving. Drivers continue to be a really big area of need to be able to get products to job sites. In terms of if we're baking in any incremental improvement in our build times. I think, I would tell you for us to achieve the high end of our guidance range. And certainly to do any more of that, we would need to see improvement in our build times from what we've seen today. But we do feel like we're maybe in the early stages of that to where we felt comfortable still, although we lowered our closings guide. We did leave 90 in the range of closing 88 to 90 because we have the houses. It's just a matter of getting them completed and across the finish line with the buyer. Deepa Raghavan : Got it. Staying on the topic of the guide. I don't think you guided for the full year gross margins unless I missed it, but it does definitely look like you have some good tailwinds that can extend into Q4 and give you some good gross margin visibility. Do you want to provide any color on that for Q4? Bill Wheat : Yes, Deepa, we do only guide one quarter out on gross margin, but I would agree with you that currently, we do have some tailwinds with the average prices that have been in our backlog and in our recent sales orders that, some of which will be homes that would close into Q4. I think we do have some tailwinds. But as we've said many times, our true visibility to margin really doesn't go far beyond the quarter. So we only guide specifically to Q3. But we do feel like we're still going to see very good gross margins through Q4 as well. Deepa Raghavan : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks very much and good luck. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. My first question is on the SG&A. I mean, obviously, the gross margin has been impressive, but so has your SG&A performance this year. You continue to come in well-below where we are modeled and where you've guided to, can you talk to the potential to continue to see that coming down now that we're solidly in that 6% range? And maybe where we can get to over time there? Bill Wheat : Thank you, Sue. Obviously, an important part of our culture and our business model. We are very focused on ensuring that we stay very efficient with our overhead, while still making sure we're building our overhead and our infrastructure to support the growth. But with the price appreciation that we've seen alongside that that has certainly aided in dropping the SG&A percentage as a percentage of revenue a bit faster, and then honestly, than we would have modeled as well. And so we've been very pleased with that. Certainly, we want to make sure we continue to position ourselves adequately there. But with the prices that we have seen and that we see coming over the next quarter or so, we do expect to still see very good SG&A leverage with the guidance that we're providing for Q3, that assumes another 50 basis point year-over-year improvement in SG&A. So yes, we do see ourselves with an SG& A rate getting down into the sixes and four at least the near term staying there. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. Thank you. And then my second question is a bit longer term. David made the comment earlier around consumer confidence. And overall, the desirability around homeownership today and how that perhaps is very different relative to where we were, certainly, coming out of the last cycle. Can you talk to what sustains that level of confidence in home ownership? And what that perhaps could mean even as rates do rise in terms of keeping that demand pool there and peoples willingness to continue to extend and really try and make that effort to get into the home? David Auld : I just -- I've been doing this for a long time. And the desire to own a home is, I think, kind of an American or part of the American culture. It gives you a sense of safety and a nest to build your family. So, I think the downturn in 2008, 2009, 2010 where home values were just decimated that put a big pause on the desire to own homes. I think as this cycle continues and I think it's going to continue to elongate, the housing formation, the desire to get close to neighborhood schools, all those things, it kind of returned home ownership to kind of the American dream again.  So, it's getting in a home today is harder. But it's not nearly as hard as it was when I bought my first home. So, it's it feels like it's almost a cultural shift from -- or a return to family community and I think the demand is significantly higher than the homes that can be produced. So. Susan Maklari : Okay, well thank you for those thoughts and good luck with everything. David Auld : Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Jay, your line is live. Jay McCanless : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to clarify, I think you've discussed this already, but in the closing guidance for the full year, that's not a shift to homes into the rental operation. That's just you guys slowing down production in the -- or slowing down orders in the field to keep up with production. Jessica Hansen : It's -- when our homes are going to be completed and the ability to close those in what quarter, yes, there's no transition to build for rent in those numbers. We've kept our homebuilding for-sale completely separate from what we're reporting on a rental basis. Mike Murray : We have a plan for both businesses. One for the for-sale side of the business and one for the rent side of the business. And the change in the guidance has nothing to do with transitioning communities from one to another. It's solely dealing with completion of homes, putting the buyer into a completed good-looking house when that house is ready. Jay McCanless : Got it. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And then my second question, I think David earlier was talking about liquidity being the competitive advantage, especially with land prices moving up. I mean when does this lack of liquidity, I think, especially for some of the smaller private builders, when does that really force a bigger wave of M&A than what we've seen so far in post-COVID? David Auld : I don't know that it's going to force a larger M&A program. I do think that their inability to secure financing to move forward on different projects or even to start houses is going to open up market opportunity for us, both in our ability to aggregate market share on the home sale side and the ability to control longer and longer land positions at very favorable numbers. So, it's a -- when you look at the impact of a two-plus month expansion of our cycle time and what that's done to our liquidity, and then I understand that we are still building houses much faster than anybody else, and we started at -- and are going to continue to protect a very strong liquidity position. It's -- I got to believe there's tremendous pressure on the -- especially the private builders. And at some point, these guys have made a lot of money over their careers. And they're guaranteeing loans. And at some point, you're just not going to put everything at risk. So I do think that's going to open up market share gains for us. And we are very well-positioned to take those market -- that market when it does open. Jay McCanless : Got it. That\u2019s great. And if I could sneak one more in, Bill it was encourage to hear that community count was up year-on-year and sequentially. How are you guys feeling about that for the full year just on a percentage change basis? Bill Wheat : We're still looking at the low single-digit increase, but we -- yeah, it has been good to see more communities get opened, starting to basically replenish our communities from -- we ran them down a bit early a year to 18 months ago. So still see a solid incremental increase in communities. Jessica Hansen : And organic growth in our core markets is still going to be the biggest driver, but we did add a few more new markets to our market count this quarter. We're now in 104 markets and have another list of markets behind that that we're planning to expand into as well. Jay McCanless : That\u2019s great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Dan Oppenheim with Credit Suisse. Dan, your line is live. Dan Oppenheim : Thanks very much. Just a quick question. Given the success that you've had in terms of Express Homes taking share generally, what you're seeing in terms of buyers coming in from competition now and just potentially market share for Express in this environment and how are you seeing that going out? David Auld : You cut out a little bit, Dan. Dan Oppenheim : Sorry, in terms of the gains for Express in terms of market share, given the efficiency of affordability there, how you're seeing that in terms of the -- what's happening to the consumer right now? David Auld : I think we\u2019ll be able to produce great value at the lower end is a tremendous advantage that we have. The bar pool significantly deeper there, qualification may be a little tougher. But as kind of referenced before, people really want to buy home and especially their first home. So I see that segment of our business just continue to get stronger. And, whereas, somebody may have pushed up and price at a very low rate, which we have a lot of first-time homebuyers buying in the Horton brand, ultimately it comes down a payment. And if their desires to own home in a very, very nice community location, our competitive advantage just gets better and better. Dan Oppenheim : Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the floor back over to David for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And to the D.R. Horton family, Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you and congratulate you on delivering an outstanding second quarter. We are incredibly well-positioned today. You once again have proven you are the best of the best in this industry. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's event. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s builder, the largest builder in the United States. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K in its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q tomorrow. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a strong third quarter, highlighted by a 53% increase in earnings to $4.67 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 54% to $2.2 billion on a 21% increase in revenues and our consolidated pre-tax profit margin improved 540 basis points to 24.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 41.7% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 35.1%. These results reflect our experienced teams, their production capabilities and our ability to leverage D.R. Horton scale across our broad geographic footprint. Housing market demand remained strong during most of the quarter. In June, we began to see a moderation in demand and an increase in cancellations due to the rapid rise in mortgage rate and continued inflationary pressures across most of the economy. The supply of both new and resale homes at affordable prices remains limited. Although demand has slowed from the frenzy pace we experienced over the past year, there are still qualified buyers in the market today as household formations continue and inflationary pressures drive rents higher. 54% of the homes we closed in the past 12 months were priced under $350,000 and our average sales price is approximately $100,000 lower than the average other public homebuilders, positioning us to continue aggregating share. There are still disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market that continue to delay the completion of our homes under construction. These construction delays and changes in demand environment led us to reduce our full year closing guidance for fiscal 2022. We remain purposefully \u2013 we purposely slowed our number of home starts in the third quarter to position our inventory to align with market conditions. Although the uncertainty of this market transition may persist from some time, we believe we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and their strong trade and supplier relationships. The strength of our balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide a significant financial flexibility and we will continue managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to optimize returns. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 53% to $4.67 per diluted share compared to $3.06 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 48% to $1.6 billion on consolidated revenue of $8.8 billion, which was in line with our expectations. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 18% to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed, up from $7 billion on 21,588 homes closed in the prior year. Continued construction delays caused by disruptions in the supply chain and tightness in the labor market caused us to close fewer homes than expected during the quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $391,200, up 20% from the prior year quarter. Paul? Paul Romanowski : During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers, with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. In June, our sales pace slowed and our cancellation rate increased when mortgage interest rates rose significantly. The cancellation rate for the third quarter was 24% compared to 17% in the prior year quarter. As a result, our net sales orders in the third quarter decreased 7% to 16,693 homes and our total net sales order value increased 8% from the prior year to $6.9 billion. Our average number of active selling communities increased 5% from the prior year quarter and was up 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $415,800, up 16% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 30.1%, up 120 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 3.9% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot increased 2.4%. The increase in our gross margin from March to June reflects the broad strength of the housing market we experienced most of this year. The strong demand for homes, combined with a limited supply allowed us to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities. As we have already mentioned, demand has moderated in June and to-date in July. As we adjust to current market conditions, we expect the pace of our sales price increases to slow during the fourth quarter and for our incentive levels to increase from historical lows. To address affordability concerns, we are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs to our buyers and we are beginning to offer other sales incentives as necessary on selected homes and inventory and to drive sales traffic to our communities. We currently expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the third quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.6%, down 50 basis points from 7.1% in the prior year quarter. This quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any quarter in our history and we remain focused on controlling our SG&A while ensuring their infrastructure adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We purposefully slowed our home starts to 17,900 homes this quarter, as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We ended the quarter with 56,400 homes in inventory, up 19% from a year ago and down 6% sequentially. 27,200 of our total homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 1,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by roughly 1 week compared to the second quarter as supply chain issues remain challenging as they have for the past year. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started. During the quarter, we will evaluate demand and adjust our homes in inventory and starts pace to meet current market conditions. Mike? Mike Murray : At June 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 600,000 lots, of which 22% were owned and 78% were controlled through purchase contracts. 24% of our total owned lots are finished and 47% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our large capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.75 billion, of which $890 million was for finished lots, $680 million was for land development, and $180 million was to acquire land. Paul? Paul Romanowski : For the third quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $308.5 million and pre-tax income of $52.7 million. For the full year, Forestar now expects to deliver 17,000 lots and generate $1.4 billion of revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of greater than 14%. Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position at June 30 totaled 97,000 lots, essentially flat with a year ago. 59% of Forestar\u2019s owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer D.R. Horton. $258 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 32.8%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Bill Wheat : Financial services pre-tax income in the third quarter was $128.3 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 50.5% compared to $70.3 million and 37.3% in the prior year quarter. The increase in our financial services pre-tax profit margin this quarter was primarily due to a significant acceleration of interest rate lot commitments. During the third quarter, a majority of our buyers in backlog for expected fourth quarter closings entered into interest rate lot commitments. These lots were executed earlier than normal due to the increase in mortgage rates, which resulted in higher-than-normal financial services revenue in the third quarter. This revenue acceleration will likely cause our financial services revenues and profits to be lower than normal in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company\u2019s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 69% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 41% of the mortgage company\u2019s volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $43 million on revenues of $110 million in the third quarter related to the sale of 1 multi-family rental property consisting of 298 units and 1 single-family rental property totaling 84 homes. During the 9 months ended June 30, our rental operations generated pre-tax income of $215 million on revenues of $489 million. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $2 billion compared to $760 million a year ago. Rental property inventory at June 30 included approximately $700 million of multi-family rental properties and $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multi-family and single-family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed, revenues or inventories. We continue to expect that our rental operations will generate approximately $800 million in revenues during fiscal 2022. We plan to continue growing our rental inventories as we position our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues, profits, and returns in future years. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. At June 30, we had $2.8 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $1.2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $1.6 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our homebuilding leverage was 17% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 12.1%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 24.9% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 19.3%. At June 30, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $18.1 billion and book value per share was $52, up 35% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 35.1% compared to 29.5% a year ago. During the first 9 months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $125 million. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $79.2 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $310 million during the quarter for a total of 10.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $854.2 million, an increase of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. As a result, our outstanding share count at June 30 was down 3% from a year ago. We still expect our outstanding share count will be approximately 3% lower at the end of fiscal 2022 and the end of fiscal 2021. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : We are providing guidance for our fourth fiscal quarter. However, due to the current uncertainty in the market, the ranges for our volume and margin guidance are wider than normal. Based on the projected completion dates of our homes under construction and current market conditions, we expect to generate consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter of $10 billion to $10.8 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 to 25,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 29% to 29.8% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be around 6.3%. We anticipate our financial services pre-tax profit margin in the fourth quarter to be less than 20% due to the timing of revenues from interest rate lot commitments as we discussed earlier. We expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% in the fourth quarter. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity and consistently paying dividends and repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and position reflecting our experienced teams and production capabilities, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across our multiple brands. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing home ownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. First question is in early June, you had mentioned needing about 18,000 orders to hit the full year delivery target. I mean, the market has obviously changed since then, but you have delivered 59,000 year-to-date. There is another 29,000 in backlog, which would give you 88,000 deliveries without even converting any of the fourth quarter orders. So what I am trying to understand is does the lower delivery outlook reflect concerns about cancellations, construction delays or both? Jessica Hansen : Both. We have had continued construction delays, but we also recognize the market has softened. And so we feel like we are very well positioned to deliver on what our new guide is for closings. But as I alluded to, I mean, our ranges are bigger than they normally would be, because of some of the uncertainty in the market. And so there is upside to our closings guide. There is also downside. I mean, we really are going to see how it plays out as we work throughout the quarter, but we are confident in our people are going to continue to improve and we will ultimately see some improvement in our construction cycle times and start converting houses to closings. John Lovallo : Great. Thank you. And then what has been your ability to resell the cancellations and has there been a meaningful ASP or margin hit to those sales? Mike Murray : It\u2019s been \u2013 still been very strong, John. We have still been able to resell those cancellations. It just doesn\u2019t happen immediately. By the time you resell it and re-qualify a buyer through the mortgage process, it could be a 4 to 8-week to 12-week process sometimes. But we are still seeing good demand for the homes that we have. John Lovallo : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about the change in cancellations as you guys look at this \u2013 is your sense that this is really just a mathematics issue, high rates, higher prices, folks can\u2019t afford or is this more psychological? In other words, folks are a little scared of what the value of their house might do? They are concerned about the economy or their jobs. I\u2019d just like sort of your sense, especially compared to past cycles of how you see the acceleration in cans, which you would attribute that to? David Auld : Hi, John. I think it\u2019s probably a little of both. I think payment shock was part of it. Toward the end of June, middle of June, we had a 100 basis point increase in long-term rates over about a 3 or 4-day period. I think that impacted it. Most people still remember 2008, \u201809, \u201810 when worst housing market I\u2019ve ever seen and values deteriorated, which again, not typical in our history of our country. So I will pause. I mean, I feel very good about where we are headed market wise and the response we are getting as we continue to sell houses out there. So \u2013 but you increase rates 100 basis points in 4 days, it does impact higher psyche. Carl Reichardt : Yes. Okay. Thanks, David. And then second question, just on the delays you are seeing in terms of vertical construction. How are delays related to horizontal? So is \u2013 are you seeing issues that would prevent you from getting the communities open that you have internally in your plan or if that were to change, would that be more a function just of a slowing market? Thanks. Paul Romanowski : I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. But yes, I mean we have seen delays in the permitting process and bringing communities online in addition to the delays that we have seen on the vertical side and so, if you look at that in aggregate and hence our guide to lower than what we had previously been guiding to. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s getting necessarily better today. Any different than we are starting to see it stabilize some on the vertical side, the horizontal side, I think will continue to be a challenge in terms of bringing new communities online on time. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, Paul. Thanks, everybody. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Carl. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Yes, I wanted to talk a little bit about your inventory management. You give a lot of statistics that are very helpful in terms of spec levels. Your finished specs are, I think, 1,400 still pretty well below normal. Your under construction specs are quite high, and I assume that\u2019s due to the cycle time. So \u2013 and then you gave some numbers around the land inventories \u2013 land spend. So I wanted to just ask where should we be thinking your finished specs? What is the desired level that you want to get to? And as that number increases, what should we expect to see for your under construction spec levels? And with the overarching view to try to get a sense for where you\u2019re construction, your CIP, construction and process inventory in dollars may go over the next couple of quarters as you see it? Bill Wheat : Sure, Steve. In terms of our completed spec homes, we\u2019re always looking to sell those as quickly as we can. We\u2019ve been at abnormally low levels. Still the 1,400 we\u2019re at today is still relatively low. But if you look historically, we\u2019ve typically been at levels quite a bit higher. So I think we\u2019re seeing a return to a more normal level on completed specs, but the goal will always be to not have more than one or two completed specs at the community and continue to make sure that we move through those, and that they don\u2019t age. In terms of our overall production, historically, when we had historically normal cycle times, you could anticipate us turning our housing inventory, our number of homes and inventory twice each year. We\u2019ve been a little slower than that this year with the elongated cycle times. But we\u2019re looking to into next year hopeful that we will see the improvements in cycle times and could get to a more normal level there as well. And so we\u2019re adjusting our starts to reflect the current moderation in demand, and we will be monitoring demand very closely to determine the appropriate level of starts going forward. But then as part of that total production that we look to turn twice historically, our spec levels as a percentage of that total have ranged from the low 40s to the low 50s. And so right now, we\u2019re kind of in that normal total spec range overall. And \u2013 so we will just be adjusting our SAR space, looking at our overall homes and inventory and our spec levels and alongside demand over the coming months to position ourselves as best we can through the current market. Stephen Kim : So just to clarify on that, Bill, do you think that your construction in progress in dollars is likely to rise as we go forward here over the next couple of quarters? Bill Wheat : I think on a cost per home basis, we have been seeing that rise with inflation. And so I think there is an element of that, that yes, that will remain. But our homes and inventory, our total number of homes and inventory expected to decline in the fourth quarter from the current level. And that\u2019s fairly normal for us in the fourth quarter as well as we deliver more homes typically than we start in the fourth quarter. Stephen Kim : Yes. Okay. So you got some seasonal factors there. Shifting gears to the incentive levels, amidst this buyer strike that we got right now. I guess I\u2019m curious, where the level of incentives are versus what is normal in your business, recognizing that recently, it\u2019s been incredibly low. But where are we now relative to what you would consider normal? And how much higher than normal do you expect to go near-term, meaning in the next quarter or so? David Auld : I would say right now, we\u2019re probably still lower than what we would consider a normal incentive. They are still a lot of buyers out there chasing homes, finding qualified buyers a little more difficult. Actually, reopening in the \u2013 some of our sales efforts has been interesting. So \u2013 but overall, I\u2019d say the incentive program today is probably less than normal. I anticipate at some point, it will return to normal. There is still not a lot of inventory out there for people to buy. Jessica Hansen : And where they go will ultimately be tied to market demand, and we will do what we typically do, which is manage it market by market, community by community to maximize returns. Stephen Kim : Absolutely. Well, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric, your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Good morning, thank you. Just curious if you could drill down a bit more to the last 30 or 45 days where you\u2019ve seen the inflection? And I guess, specifically, I understand the comment, there is still a lot of buyers out there, but curious what has happened with cancellation rates? Obviously, the 24 in the quarter feels like that\u2019s more elevated in this more recent period of time. Where has that been? And what is the expectation for that as we look into 4Q? Bill Wheat : Cancellation rates during the quarter. In the first part of the quarter, they were in the normal range. For us, we had been for a while below normal. So it was in the normal range. And then it did definitely increased sharply in June, which then brought the overall average for the quarter up. As far as today in July, I would still say it\u2019s elevated, has not continued on a trend much higher, but it still is at an elevated level. And so we\u2019re monitoring that along with our gross sales activity and responses to incentives and other affordability measures we\u2019re trying to provide for our homebuyers and we will be monitoring that very closely going forward. But like we\u2019ve said thus far, we\u2019re still seeing a very good level of core demand out there. We\u2019re reselling our cancellations rather smoothly thus far. And so we\u2019re hopeful that we will find some stability here in the demand environment in our sales and cans environment over the next few months. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly, if you could, in terms of either mix or geography, I\u2019m curious if there is any variation or any difference in behavior on sort of entry level versus within the move up or higher end of your price points? So from a geographic standpoint, is there any differentiation or is the higher rates had a similar impact across price points, product and geographies? Mike Murray : I think there is certainly more impact potentially on the buyers that are mortgage rate sensitive, but we still saw 56% of our closings were first-time homebuyers in the quarter. And we closed a substantial number of homes in June to those first-time homebuyers that need a place to live. We\u2019ve been able to provide some interest rate lot products from our mortgage company that\u2019s given those buyers comfort and certainty around payment, but they are still buying a home out of need and necessity. Buyers that are more discretionary in nature. And as question earlier alluded to qualification versus value expectations, they are probably more in the value expectations side of taking a pause this summer and seeing where the housing market goes. But the biggest part of our business is focused primarily on the first-time buyer, first-time move up and providing an affordable home. So we\u2019re still seeing people buying our homes out of need. Eric Bosshard : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate all the comments and guidance. I wanted to drill down a little bit if possible on the gross margin guidance and the current rate of incentives that we\u2019ve heard have increased over the last 1 or 2 months when we\u2019ve heard in our conversations with different private builders, incentives are up anywhere from 100 to 300 basis points. Your guidance midpoint is down only about roughly 100 bps sequentially. So, seeing that you\u2019re at the lower end of that let\u2019s say, if that range is accurate, the 100 to 300, so I just want to make \u2013 does that make sense to you in terms of those comments that make sense in terms of what we\u2019ve heard. And do you think this increase that you\u2019ve had in the last 1 or 2 months, has that, in effect, kind of brought sales pace back into a desired level or are you seeing incentives continue to rise as we\u2019re working through in July? Bill Wheat : Mike, I\u2019ll start with the gross margin on these guys may chime in a little bit more on the trends on incentives going forward. Gross margin guide itself. It starts with our backlog as we enter quarter. And as we mentioned, we had a lot of buyers that locked in their mortgage rates that they are expecting to close in Q4. And so we have more visibility to those homes that we expect to close in Q4 to the margins we expect to see there. So that\u2019s the biggest piece of our visibility into our guide. We do still have some homes that we are selling in the current quarter that we will close, and those homes are more likely to be a little more exposed to the current incentive environment. And so we\u2019d expect there to be a few more incentives in some of those homes, which has been factored into the guide as well. And so I think you have many comments in the market around level of incentives, I don\u2019t I wouldn\u2019t say those are inaccurate at all. But our closings in the coming quarter will partially reflect some of the current environment, but will also reflect some buyers that are in backlog and have their rates locked and marching towards closing in Q4. Mike Murray : The margin guidance, we talked about earlier is also reflective of the cost environment that we faced over the past 6 to 9 months as we started homes at different times and at different lumber pricing, frankly, was a big driver of it. General inflationary pressures across most of our cost categories, but certainly, the lumber has had a great deal of variability over the past 12 months. It rose significantly, fell off a bit, it went back up again and now it\u2019s back down. So as those homes push through the production process and deliver, they are going to have an impact on the gross margin as well. Mike Rehaut : Great. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that color. Secondly, you highlighted earlier in your prepared remarks about the continued levels of share repurchase. How should we \u2013 I know it\u2019s a little forward-looking. And you\u2019ve been on a pace over the last couple of years where you\u2019ve been reducing your share count low single digits. To the extent that we\u2019re in, obviously, a little bit of a softer market and that moderately softer levels continue. How should we think about share repurchase for fiscal \u201823. And assuming things don\u2019t fall off a cliff, but they are obviously still at a more moderate rate. Would you dial it back or given the strength of your balance sheet and still strong cash flows and very healthy margins, should we expect some level of continued share repurchase in \u201823? David Auld : Our plan from day 1 has been consistent over time, balanced with supporting the homebuilding inventories and funding the growth. I don\u2019t see that changing in \u201823, \u201824 or \u201825. We just \u2013 our goal is to be out there, operating consistently growing our market share, expanding homeownership opportunity for as many families as we possibly can. And I don\u2019t see that changing. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Just another one on gross margins, asked a different way here, I know the visibility to \u201823 is limited here. But I guess in an environment where incentives do return to normal, as David alluded to earlier, just curious if you could outline kind of how the gross margin of the business might look in such a scenario? Bill Wheat : Well, anytime we see a change in market conditions. And right now, we do expect the level of price increases to moderate and start to flatten out. We\u2019ve already talked a bit about incentives rising. The top line is impacted quicker than our costs are. So we usually see two or three quarters where our higher costs are still coming through, and that puts some pressure on near-term margins. But then as that inflection begins, it opens the door up to be able to start addressing on the cost side. We\u2019ve already seen some relief from lumber, which that will start to be more of a tailwind for us in coming quarters. And then other categories really beginning with labor becomes an opportunity as well. And so our goal will be to do as much as we can on the cost side to offset the impact that we see from prices flattening and incentive levels to maintain as good a margin as we can balance with pace to generate the best returns that we can generate. Where that will be, will depend on \u2013 will be dependent on the strength of the housing market and demand. David Auld : Ultimately, it\u2019s going to come down to what drives the best return for that individual flag. Same formula we\u2019ve been working on \u2013 working with for the \u2013 coming out of the downturn. Our long-term focus is returning the best we can with the inventory that we put out there, and that\u2019s not going to change. We deemphasized gross margins when we could deliver every house we wanted to build as the construction process became more and more challenging we expanded margins because we were delivering every house we possibly can. At the end of the day, it\u2019s returned, it\u2019s ROI, it\u2019s ROE. That\u2019s our focus. Matthew Bouley : Got you. That\u2019s really helpful, gentlemen. Thank you for that. And then second one, I have to ask the impairment question, which obviously at a 30% gross margin. We\u2019re not near anything like that at this point, but given it is an investor concern here. So I guess the way to ask the question is within your portfolio, certainly, there is going to be communities below the average by definition. But is there any \u2013 would you be able to highlight or point to any portion of the portfolio that might be more vulnerable to something like impairments where the home price declines may not be as severe as you might look on a national average just basically, what portion of the portfolio would you consider to be potentially more vulnerable to impairments, the longer that this type of softness in housing persists? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Matt. I think you led with the most important point, which is we\u2019re starting at a 30% gross margin. So that really signifies that we\u2019re a long way off from any sort of broad-based impairments. It would take significant margin erosion from declines in home prices. We don\u2019t have any projects right now that are what we deem internally on our watch list because they are approaching a gross margin that we would have to do a more thorough impairment analysis and to really see even any sort of pickup in a watch list before we even get to the point of impairments, we\u2019d have to see a pretty big home price decline. So I wouldn\u2019t say there is any one piece of our portfolio right now. that we would point to as being at higher risk than others. But certainly, as we continue to move through a market transition, if there are certain markets where home prices come down further than others, those would be the ones we\u2019d point to first. Matthew Bouley : Alright. Thank you, Jessica. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First one on incentives. And I know it\u2019s early innings as far as any meaningful increases there. But curious what you\u2019re seeing on the elasticity of those incentives where you are offering them? Are there certain markets where perhaps the incentives have been more effective at driving increased traffic and orders? And are there markets where based on what you\u2019re seeing so far, demand seems less elastic or maybe even inelastic to any increase in incentives. Paul Romanowski : Alan, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a definite pattern as of yet. I think that the incentives that we have put out, as we\u2019ve stated, are still at this point below historical norms are being effective in terms of driving the traffic. Traffic in total has slowed just based on the market conditions and the change that we\u2019ve already talked about. But generally speaking, those incentives have accomplished what we\u2019ve been trying to do in terms of driving additional traffic and converting the homes as our cancellation rate has rise. We\u2019ve been able to convert those homes that are completed, and we still have a lot of buyers with a near-term need to get into a house. And so we will adjust as the market needs to flag-by-flag community-by-community drive the returns we\u2019re looking for. And the pace is the driver of that. Alan Ratner : Got it. Appreciate that. Second question, I would love to drill in a little bit on your build for rent business. Only one communities sold this quarter, which was a bit lower than the last few quarters. But a lot of people have kind of talked about the \u2013 maybe the bull point where if kind of the core demand does soften for an extended period of time that there is all this capital on the sidelines targeting build for rent that perhaps might be able to fill at least part of that void. So curious what you\u2019re seeing in your conversations with build for rent investors and the parties that you\u2019re selling these communities to. Have you seen any shift in their appetite and as you market the next round of communities? I know you have some guidance for sales in the fourth quarter or maybe even thinking about early \u201823. What\u2019s your expectation for the demand in the BFR space? Mike Murray : We still see very strong interest when we take communities to market and still very encouraged by that. Certainly, the valuation equation is heavily impacted by long-term financing costs for those investors. So \u2013 and in periods of volatility in those costs in their underwriting. It\u2019s a little longer to get the process completed with these transactions, but there is still tremendous demand for them. And they are still on the front end of it, as we see these communities begin to complete units and we open up to leasing, we\u2019re still seeing strong demand for people moving into the homes. And so that\u2019s ultimately very encouraging as we\u2019re creating cash flow assets that there is, as you mentioned, a lot of capital interested in investing in those assets today. Alan Ratner : A follow-up on that if I could. Have you shifted any communities that are earlier in the planning process from for sale to for rent when you look at your total lot pipeline, pushing 600,000 lots if you are selling 80,000 homes a year, which is kind of your run rate for the year, roughly, it would seem like that\u2019s a lot of land, probably more land than you need and perhaps there is an opportunity to shift some of that to BFR more so than perhaps you thought a quarter or two quarters ago? Mike Murray : We certainly evaluate that in terms of demand for the \u2013 for sale in our portfolio. If pace slows down in a given market, then our land position gets a little longer in that market, looking for ways we always thought build to rent is a great way to more rapidly monetize land positions without cannibalizing for sale business because it\u2019s a different user of that real estate and different owner of the real estate. So, it brings other capital pools to bear. So, we certainly have repurposed projects that we originally may have identified 3 years to 4 years ago, is for sale. Today, they are being executed as for rent, and that process continues. I mean we underwrite our land buys on the basis of a for-sale purchase. We do not look at the valuations from a build-to-rent aspect in underwriting land buys. Alan Ratner : Appreciate that color. Thanks Mike. Mike Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Truman Patterson : Hey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Hoping you all could just give an update on your June order exit rate as well as what you are seeing in July? And then following up on Eric\u2019s question, one of your peers kind of gave a lay of the land based on metro or even regional performance. Just hoping you can give some color on the out or underperforming metros? Jessica Hansen : I think we are all looking at each other. Can you specify your first question on exit rate again, so we make sure we answer the right question. Truman Patterson : Yes. Your June orders. Just trying to get an update there, what kind of the decline was and how July is trending? Jessica Hansen : Okay. Well, we don\u2019t ever speak to monthly orders specifically. That being said, we did guide at a conference in early June that we expected our sales to be essentially flat for the quarter on a year-over-year basis, and we came in down 7%. So, that does tell you that in most of June because rates spiked pretty quickly after we made those comments, most of June, we did see softening and June would have been our worst sales month of the quarter, as a result of both the moderation in demand and the pickup in cancellation rates that we have already talked to. And then I think Bill said earlier in one of his Q&A responses that our can rate hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten worse since June, but it has stayed elevated into July, and sales have continued to be a challenge, but we do still see a decent level of demand out in the market and are selling and closing homes every day so far in July. Truman Patterson : Okay. Perfect. And then any color on any kind of problem metros or metros you are seeing outside strength? David Auld : Yes. Texas, Florida, I think are going to continue to drive national numbers. General lines has continued to be stable and strong for us, we are really \u2013 from a historical norm, from my history with the company and my history in the industry. It\u2019s a good mark. I mean to talk about some areas being stressed or problematic. It just doesn\u2019t exist today. Is there a pause, is there a reset in kind of the prior expectation, yes, absolutely. Payment shock when rates go up 100 basis points in four days, yes, absolutely. But demographics, demand, the desire to get out of the areas, all those are enforced and continuing and our expectations for next year or that we are going to get back on pace. So, all good in D.R. Horton. Truman Patterson : Okay. Perfect. And then Matt asked about kind of owned-land impairments. But I want to ask a little differently. You all really transformed your balance sheet compared to the prior cycle, heavy option land position. Have you all started to rework any of those deals? And what sort of market conditions would you really need to see in order to perhaps walk from any of the more recent contracts? Mike Murray : We are constantly evaluating the land portfolio. That\u2019s one of the benefits of having the option position we have is that we get the chance to continue to make decisions about projects as we move through them. Those land projects that we have \u2013 and neighborhood projects that we have identified in the portfolio, very important to the future deliveries of the company, and we are going to continue to work through those neighborhoods. But everybody we work with understands that we are all working together in the same market conditions and a change at the front end of selling homes to home buyers will ripple all the way through the value chain, and it starts ultimately with the land. So, we will continue to rework our portfolio as needed. And we always are continually making adjustments to reflect current on-the-ground conditions, whether it\u2019s an acceleration or deceleration of the given project. Truman Patterson : Okay. Thank you all. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. My first question is going back to lumber. There are some changes that are coming through in the future, better aligning them with how builders actually take the lumber in. Given the volatility that you are seeing and the uncertainty in demand, are you considering \u2013 or would you think about perhaps starting to hedge some of those costs? Mike Murray : Is that a sales pitch for Goldman? Sorry. Susan Maklari : No. Mike Murray : We have historically not tried to hedge any of those positions, and we work with our local suppliers and partners to bring the lumber to the job sites to the best value possible. We have not yet seen how those markets are going to function or evaluate it yet if that\u2019s a possibility for us. But we will certainly look at things that make sense to offset risk in our business. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. I appreciate that. My second question is on land spend. You obviously talked about what you allocated in the quarter. As you think about the upcoming year, any initial thoughts on where that may go and how to think about it relative to where you have been this year and perhaps last year even? Bill Wheat : Yes. Susan, we only own about 130,000 lots today. So, we are constantly buying lots more and more, a larger percentage of our purchases are of finished lots and that we essentially put into production almost on a just-in-time basis. So, we will be continuing to replenish our owned lot supply along the way. As Mike said, adjusting our optioned portfolio on a constant basis. So, I would expect there will still be a steady reinvestment and replenishment of our land pipeline. Obviously, as we see how the current market conditions transition here, we will be evaluating the depth and demand, the strength of the demand and then positioning our land and our lots and our homes and inventory to match those conditions as we go into next year. And our spend will then align with the plans that we set. Susan Maklari : Okay. Alright. Great. Thank you. Good luck with everything. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities. Deepa, your line is live. Deepa Raghavan : Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the prior question asked by Truman on market color. Wasn\u2019t clear if that was a volume comment that you provided or pricing? I had a question on pricing, though. Can you talk through any surprise elements within your orders pricing trends, moderation or decline or were you surprised the resilience in some of your markets? David Auld : Surprised. I don\u2019t know that surprised, it\u2019s probably a great turn. We are responding to and it\u2019s my belief, I think our belief that buyer demand is \u2013 I mean there is still more housing formations, job creations and there are homes being built. And so I think we have talked about elongated cycles in the past. This pause disruption, could it get worse, absolutely. But I have been doing this a long time. And in a conversation with one of our regional presidents a couple of days ago, we were talking about the market. And he and I both have been doing this a long time. Both have been in sales models when selling homes was very difficult. And this is probably the second best market ever. So, I guess I understand that there is uncertainty out there. But when you have people that want to buy homes, I mean we are going to adjust, we are going to figure out how to put those people in homes. That\u2019s what we do. And so that\u2019s market-by-market, flag-by-flag, division-by-division, however you want to cut it up, we are going to build, sell, start \u2013 we are going to start and close up [ph]. And create home ownership opportunities. That\u2019s what the mission of this company is. So, that\u2019s what we are going to do. Bill Wheat : And Dave, it\u2019s in the current trends, it\u2019s still very early to determine exactly what magnitude of adjustments may occur. We are still evaluating that on a week-by-week basis when \u2013 as David said earlier, when rates spiked, there is an adjustment period. And we are in that adjustment period right now where buyers are \u2013 there is a little bit of a rate shock or a payment shock. And so they are adjusting expectations and we are going to how to adjust with them to make sure we get them into the homes that they want to purchase. Deepa Raghavan : Fair enough. My follow-up is on start space this quarter. The 17,000 starts pace, how much was trimmed by supply chain issues. And any thoughts on what could be a reasonable start pace near-term? I mean look, frankly, I am aware you are unable to provide volume thoughts into 2023, but under what circumstances would you expect to grow over the 85,000 units guided here for 2022, just based on the start space that you have been printing recently? Paul Romanowski : Deepa, looking at our starts and we purposefully reduced that start pace over the last quarter, again, to meet the market, and that\u2019s largely from production and production capacity. We had big start pace in the prior quarters leading into this and with continued challenges in the supply chain and the labor markets, giving our chance, giving our people and our vendors the ability to catch up and move those homes forward. And on a go-forward basis, we will adjust those start paces to market conditions. So, as we have mentioned, we are still early in this pause period an adjustment. And as we find our base, we will maintain start pace that we want to drive the units and deliveries we are looking for. Jessica Hansen : And too early to say anything on fiscal \u201823, we will reassess in November. If we have a little bit more certainty in the market, then hopefully, we will be in a position to give some high-level guidance for the full year, but it\u2019s going to depend on the market. And if it\u2019s settled out, and we feel comfortable doing that or not. We are always going to position ourselves to grow and consolidate market share. But it\u2019s really going to be up to market conditions and what makes the most sense in terms of us maximizing our returns. Bill Wheat : Part of that positioning going into next year is our number of homes and inventory. We have 56,000 homes in inventory, today, and we are guiding to close between 23.5 and 25.5 in the coming quarters. So, we are going to go into the year with inventory as well and we will supplement it with our start pace in Q4 and beyond to then drive to the volume levels that will drive next year. Deepa Raghavan : Fair enough. Thanks very much and good luck. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citigroup. Anthony, your line is live. Asher Sohnen : Hi. This is Asher Sohnen on for Anthony. And I just wanted to ask, I think you are currently selling homes on land that was largely at least partially put under control prior to the pandemic. So, just looking at the prices for lots that you are putting under contract now and then trying to hold all else, would it be possible to sort of quantify how those gross margins on these new lots might compare to current gross margins? And just generally, very roughly how long before you start to exhaust that favorable cost basis? Jessica Hansen : Land prices vary across the country and the rate of increases in land prices have varied. So, we have talked to you each quarter, what our lot costs have done on a square foot basis, and we have really not seen more than a low to mid-single digit increase in terms of what\u2019s flowing through our closings each quarter. And with the vast amount of land we are buying on a quarter-to-quarter basis and it all being contracted for at different dates over it maybe in the last year, it may be in the last 3 years that we contracted for it. we would expect to continue to see a relatively modest increase in lot costs flowing through in our future quarter closings. Asher Sohnen : Understood. Thanks. And then you slowed starts this quarter to better sort of match anticipated demand, if I heard correctly. So, just on a strategic level, do you see D.R. Horton is maybe trying to gain share in the housing slowdown, or how do you think about the level of discipline around supply/demand maybe among your peers and competitors compared to prior cycles? David Auld : I think compared to prior cycles, the entire industry is much more disciplined, much more focused on cash flow, much more focused on return, accelerating land prices. So, you look at our starts, you look at the industry starts, in June, I think very, very fast reaction to the rate increases. We will see what happens in July and August. But our expectation is that you are going to see starts stay disciplined. And when the rates stabilize and we can adjust pricing and offerings to the buyers and they are comfortable buying them, then I think you will see starts tick back up. But it\u2019s just a different world today than it was in \u201804, \u201805, \u201806. You have got a real business that\u2019s building assets today. Bill Wheat : And then specific to market share gains, that\u2019s always a core part of our strategy. Asher Sohnen : Okay. Thanks. I will pass it over. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on some of the comments on the July trend. In June, you talked about the moderation with the affordability shock and the spike in mortgage rate. Has demand sort of continued to decelerate, or have we seen sort of a stabilization and reset? Mike Murray : Hard to say. It\u2019s early into the quarter as to where we are. The past few summers, we have not seen much seasonal falloff. This year, I think we are seeing a little more seasonality. But we still see traffic in the models. We still see people out buying homes. It\u2019s not a zero environment. People are still moving into the homes that we complete and close. It\u2019s probably coming back to a little more normal seasonality, where the middle of the summer gets a little bit slower from a traffic perspective. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then you commented on the material cost outlook and labor potentially coming down. Are you seeing land prices come down? Has there been any relief on that side with the slower demand in the market? Paul Romanowski : No, we really \u2013 I think as you look at this process, and again, we are really at a pause in the market. And one of the last things we see to come down is going to be the land. It\u2019s a little slower to react than first, we probably see it in the labor on a localized basis and the materials and then land will adjust over time based on market conditions, just like it always has. It\u2019s going to rise and flow a little behind housing demand. David Auld : I will also say, Rafe. We have a very deep pipeline of our plan that we have controlled for multiple years. And it does put us in a position where if we see the imbalance in land pricing versus future market expectations, we don\u2019t have to buy it. We have got the ability to pause in our land acquisition for an extended period if we think that\u2019s the prudent decision. Rafe Jadrosich : Good. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I would now like to hand the call back to David Auld for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everybody\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And to the D.R. Horton family, you are a driving force in the creation of affordable housing in this country. What you do is important. Don Horton and the entire executive team, thank you for your focus and hard work. Let\u2019s finish this year and move on to \u201823. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

We are also joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officers and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, which included a 20% increase in consolidated pretax income to $2.1 billion and a 19% increase in revenues to $9.6 billion.  Our pretax profit margin for the quarter improved 10 basis points to 21.4%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 26% to $4.67. For the year, consolidated pretax income increased 42% to $7.6 billion on $33.5 billion of revenue, which increased 21%. Our pretax profit margin for the year improved 350 basis points to 22.8%, and our earnings per diluted share increased 45% to $16.51.  We closed a record of 83,518 this year in our whole building and single-family rental operations. And our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues of 6.8% was an all-time low. Our home many return on inventory for. the year was 42.8% and our consolidated return on the equity was 34.5%. Our strong financial performance during a year of significant challenges and volatility reflects the strength of our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings.  Our homebuilding cash flow from operations for 2022 was $1.9 billion. Over the past 5 years, we have generated $7.5 billion of cash flow from homebuilding operations while growing our consolidated revenues by 138% and our earnings per share by 503%. During this time, we also more than doubled our book value per share, consistently kept our homebuilding leverage under 20% and increased our homebuilding liquidity by $1.8 billion, all while significantly increasing our returns on inventory and equity.  During most of the year, demand for our homes was strong. In June, we began to see a moderation in housing demand that has continued and accelerated through today. The rapid rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty, have made many buyers pause in their home buying decision or choose to not move forward with their home purchase. However, the supply of both new and resell homes at affordable price points remains limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable.  The uncertainty of this market transition may persist for some time and could get more challenging if mortgage rates continue increasing. However, we are well positioned to meet changing market conditions with our experienced teams, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us financial flexibility.  We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, old pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to beat the market, optimize returns, increase market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike? Michael Murray : Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 26% to $4.67 per share. And for the year, earnings per share increased 45% to $16.51. Net income for the quarter increased 22% to $1.6 billion. And for the year, net income increased 40% to $5.9 billion.  Our fourth quarter home sales revenues increased 23% and to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed, up from $7.6 billion on 21,937 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $403,700, up 17% from last year and up 3% sequentially. We closed fewer homes than we expected during the fourth quarter due to a slower sales pace, increased cancellations and continued construction delays.  In addition, we estimate that approximately 730 home closings in Florida and South Carolina were delayed from September due to Hurricane Ian. Paul? Paul Romanowski : During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our homebuyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter decreased 15% to 13,582 homes, and our net sales order value was down 10% from the prior year to $5.4 billion.  Our cancellation rate during the fourth quarter was 32% compared to 19% in the prior year quarter and 24% in the third quarter. Our average number of active selling communities increased 8% from the prior year and was flat sequentially. The average sales price on net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $399,600, up 6% from the prior year but down 4% sequentially from the June quarter. In October, as mortgage rates continue to increase, our net sales orders were below prior year levels, and our cancellation rate remained elevated.  As a result, we currently expect our first quarter net sales orders to be down approximately 25% to 35% year-over-year. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the fourth quarter was 28.3% . up 140 basis points from the prior year quarter, but down 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. On a per square foot basis, our revenues were up 4% sequentially while our stick and brick cost per square foot increased 8% and our lot cost increased 3%. The decrease in our gross margin from the third to fourth quarter reflects the increase in our stick and brick costs and increased incentives provided to homebuyers to ensure the closings of our homes and backlog during the rapid rise in mortgage interest rates. We are offering mortgage interest rate locks and buydowns and other sales incentives to address affordability concerns and to drive sales traffic to our communities.  As we adjust to market conditions and focus on turning our inventory to maximize returns, our incentive levels have continued to increase, and we are adjusting base home prices where necessary. We expect our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease from current levels in fiscal 2023.  As a result, we are working with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts and are pleased with our early progress. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the fourth quarter, homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.7%, down 20 basis points from 6.9% in the prior year quarter. For the year, homebuilding SG&A expense was 6.8%, down 50 basis points from 7.3% in 2021.  Our annual homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is at its lowest point in our history, and we will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. In fiscal 2023, our homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues will likely increase from current levels. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started fewer homes this quarter as we work to position our inventory with an appropriate number of homes relative to market conditions. We started 13,100 homes during the quarter in our homebuilding operations as we began negotiations to lower our construction costs on future new home starts. We ended the year with 46,400 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago and down 18% sequentially.  27,200 of our total homes at September 30 were unsold of which 4,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time increased by a week compared to the third quarter, which reflects continued lingering supply chain issues. However, we are beginning to see some stabilization in cycle times on homes we have recently started, and we expect our cycle time to improve in fiscal 2023. We expect our start pace in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to increase versus our fourth quarter pace, and we will adjust our starts in homes and inventory to meet the level of demand in the market. Mike? Michael Murray : At September 30, our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 573,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 25,000 lots from June to September. 29% of our total owned lots are finished and 50% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them.  Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on current and expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our lot and land pipeline and our investments in lots, land and development to meet our needs during this transition in the housing market.  During the quarter, our homebuilding segment wrote off $34 million of option deposits and due diligence cost related to land and lot option contracts we terminated or expect to terminate in the future. We expect our level of option cost write-offs to remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio.  Our homebuilding segment had no inventory impairments during the quarter or the year. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.5 billion, down 19% from the prior year quarter and down 15% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $780 million for finished lots, $560 million for land development and $150 million to acquire land. Paul? Paul Romanowski : For the fourth quarter, Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $381.4 million, 3,914 lots sold and pretax income of $66.4 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 17,691 lots, generating $1.5 billion of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 15.5%.  At September 30, Forestar's owned and controlled lot position was 90,100 lots. 59% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with D.R. Horton or subject to a right of first offer. $250 million of D.R. Horton's lot purchases in the fourth quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had approximately $620 million of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 26.9%.  Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with a strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Bill Wheat : Financial services pretax income in the fourth quarter was $2.4 million on $134 million of revenue, with a pretax profit margin of 1.8%. As expected, our financial services pretax profit margin decreased this quarter primarily due to a significant pull forward of revenue from rate lock commitments in the third quarter, as we discussed on last quarter's call. Also during the fourth quarter, there were increased competitive pressures in the mortgage market and increased cost of rate locks provided to customers due to rising rates. For the year, financial services pretax income was $291 million, on $795 million of revenue, representing a 36.6% pretax profit margin.  We expect our financial services pretax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the fourth quarter but below the full year of fiscal 2022. During the fourth quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 73% of our homebuyers.  FHA and VA loans accounted for 42% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Michael Murray : During fiscal 2022, our rental operations generated $510 million from the sale of 775 multifamily rental units and 774 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $202 million. In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $21 million of revenues from the sale of 96 single-family rental homes and incurred a pretax loss of $13 million, which were below our expectations going into the quarter.  We had several single-family rental projects in Florida, totaling 562 homes that were scheduled to close in September, but were delayed due to Hurricane Ian. These projects closed in October and will be reflected in our first quarter results. Also one multifamily project and multiple Single-family rental projects that were expected to be sold and closed in the fourth quarter were delayed due to changes in the capital markets that affected the timing of buyers' financing.  Our rental property inventory at September 30 was $2.6 billion, which included approximately $900 million of multifamily rental properties and $1.7 billion of single-family rental properties. As a reminder, our multifamily and single-family rental operating results are separately reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories.  We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operating platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders.  During fiscal 2022, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $1.9 billion and the cumulative cash generated from our homebuilding operations for the past 5 years was $7.5 billion. At September 30, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility.  Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 13.2% at fiscal year-end and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at September 30 was 23.8%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15.4%.  We repaid $350 million of senior notes at maturity this quarter and we have $700 million of senior notes that mature during fiscal 2023. At September 30, our stockholders' equity was $19.4 billion, and book value per share was $56.39 and up 35% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 34.5%, an improvement of 290 basis points from 31.6% a year ago. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $78.2 million for a total of $316.5 million of dividends paid during the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for $251.7 million for a total of 14 million shares repurchased during the year for $1.1 billion. As a result, our outstanding share count is down 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.25 per share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. As we have already mentioned, we are utilizing more incentives in today's market and are reducing home sales prices where necessary which will impact our average sales prices and gross margins more in the first quarter than the quarter we just completed.  We are providing detailed guidance for the first quarter as is our standard practice but due to the current uncertainty in the market, our ranges for expectations are wider than normal. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our December quarter of $6 billion to $6.8 billion and our homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 15,000 to 16,500 homes.  We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 23% to 24% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be approximately 8% to 8.4%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 20% and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23% in the first quarter. Looking further out into fiscal 2023, we have less visibility due to the macro level uncertainties we have mentioned. It is too early to know what housing market conditions will be 3 to 6 months from now during the spring selling season, so we are not providing specific guidance for the full year yet. We will reassess each quarter and give more color on our expectations as we can. We are well positioned to aggregate market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations.  Our fiscal 2023 home closings volume, pricing and margins will be determined by future market conditions and our efforts to meet the market and improve our inventory turns, construction cycle times and costs. Our goal is to generate consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 that are slightly higher than fiscal 2022.  However, the low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues potentially down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2023 of approximately 23% we expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, and we plan to consistently repurchase shares to reduce our share count during the year with the amount of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities.  We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to operate effectively in changing economic conditions and continuing to aggregate market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. Your efforts during 2022 were remarkable. This was a year in which we faced construction and operational challenges we have never faced before with periods of unsustainably high demand, followed by historic rise in mortgage rates.  Despite these challenges and market volatility, we closed the most homes in a year in our company's history, completing our 21st year as the largest builder in the United States with record profit and returns, and we are well positioned to continue improving our operations and providing homeownership opportunities to more American families in 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much, guys, and thanks for all the information. Obviously, pretty solid performance in a tough environment. I wanted to ask you specifically about your starts outlook. Can you give us a sense for how much of an increase in starts we might expect in the December quarter, maybe year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter? And maybe alternatively, how many finished specs or total specs per community are you expecting to have as you enter the new calendar year? Paul Romanowski : Stephen, looking into the first quarter, we are finishing the year with 46,000 homes in inventory and positioned for our goals as we look forward to the year and looking to maintain a similar balance as we work through the first quarter. So expect that our starts will keep pace with our closings through the first quarter. Stephen Kim : Got you. And then ... Bill Wheat : Yes. In terms of the completed specs, Steve, we're in a more normal position now with having some completed specs across more of our communities. That puts us in a good position to sell in the current environment given that buyers are concerned about what their interest rates are going to be. So if we have homes that are ready to move into quickly. They can lock their rates with confidence and close on a known schedule. Stephen Kim : So the level of completed specs you have now is you're comfortable with sort of maintaining that level, right? That's what you're saying? Bill Wheat : Yes. Stephen Kim : Okay. And then the second question relates to your comments about navigating the difficult environment or the uncertain environment by managing your product offerings and negotiating lower cost is certainly the negotiation of lower costs. I understand that's going to be ongoing. But the managing of your product offerings, can you give us a sense for how quickly you're able to swap out models or at least floor plans that you're offering in your communities.  Is that something that we could expect you to do in communities that are currently open? Or are we really looking at communities that are going to be new communities opening up. Maybe give us a sense for like what share of the communities you will have open, let's say, for the spring selling season will have a revamped product line. Michael Murray : In most of our communities across the country, Steve, we'll be able to start back smaller homes primarily and change specification levels in those homes. That we start -- have been starting in the most recent quarter and will be starting in the first quarter.  There are some communities that are a little more locked in on product and planned neighborhood phases that it may take 3 to 6 months to work through some changes in the product offerings. But by and large, most of our communities, those changes are starting today, and we'll continue to see that roll out through the next 6 to 9 months. David Auld : And Stephen, even with product lines that we've been offering as a spec builder, we release certain houses every month. So when the market is running red hot like it was first half plus of last year. You have a tendency and release the bigger houses because your that dollar profit per house is higher.  Now when a price point becomes much more important to the buyers. We made the release, they go from the 2,300 square foot 2-story down to the 1,600 square foot ranch, which drops the overall ASP of the community without really changing the product or impacting valuations within the community. Stephen Kim : Great. That's really helpful. David Auld : We control that by which houses we will lease into production. Operator : The next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John Lovallo : First one is the first quarter order guide implies quarter-over-quarter improvement, which would sort of buck normal seasonality. Can you just help us with some of the puts and takes there? Bill Wheat : Well, really, we're just looking at our plans and what we're seeing right now week to week. We're already 5 weeks into our quarter. So we've got one month in the books. And as we just look at our pace that we're seeing right now and that we believe that that's where we're going to wind up.  There obviously seasonality, if you look at history, has been a little bit unusual in the last couple of years. And I think we're still in a little bit of an unusual time with what has happened with rates. But with our positioning across the board with our community count increasing, we feel like our order position in Q1 is in line with what we guided. Jessica Hansen : And as our production got further along as well, we felt more comfortable loosening up a lot of the sales restrictions you've heard us talk about. Even though we're continuing to sell later in the process, with some negligible improvement on our cycle times, but getting further along in the construction cycles, we have more homes available for sale going into Q1 than we've had. John Lovallo : Makes sense. Okay. Great. And then the ASP in the fourth quarter down about 4% sequentially. How much of that was like-for-like pricing versus mix. Bill Wheat : Yes, at this point, it's like-for-like. I mean, we're -- as we said, we're increasing incentives and then where necessary community by community, we're adjusting prices. And so I don't believe there's necessarily been a big change in mix yet. And so it's more likely from like-for-like. Operator : The next question today is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl Reichardt : You talked about cutting base prices where necessary. Can you give me a sense of how often it's been necessary that maybe a percentage of communities or percentage of orders this quarter where base prices were cut and what level of cuts are creating some elasticity in unit demand. Paul Romanowski : Carl, I don't know that we can get specific in terms of communities or by area. We are finding the market community by community and market by market. Those cuts on base have not been significant to this point. We have focused on financial incentives and interest rate and where needed to, we've been able to adjust price and find the market to drive additional traffic and sales. Jessica Hansen : And a lot of our guide is coming from what we know we're going to put into the market in terms of when we're opening new communities or new phases, we can reset our base pricing that way. And than so we do expect our ASP to shift down throughout the year. But as Paul mentioned, to date, it's been more heavily incentivized than it has been base price cuts. Carl Reichardt : Okay. And then on cycle times, starting to see a little bit of easing and working with the trades and suppliers, would your guess be that your cycle times could get to sort of normal pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '23? Or is that too much to help for at this point? Michael Murray : Anecdotally, I was talking to a builder last week. He said he started a house in late August, and he's going to close it in December. So he was pretty excited about that. That's 1 story, 1 house out of a lot of houses. Jessica Hansen : And builder equals construction superintended -- our employees. Michael Murray : He was really excited about that. So I think we're making the right progress. We're starting to see a little bit of progress pick up in the numbers of October completions. We got a little bit of time back there. Getting all the way back to where we want to be pre-pandemic levels, it might be by the end of the year for the starts that we have later in the year that we're pushing It through, but we're going to make that progress this year. David Auld : Carl, just -- we've talked about it, I think, for a while, but just the discipline in the industry today is it has translated into across-the-board slowdown in starts. And I think it will allow the trade base material suppliers to kind of get the feet under them. And I've been accused of being overly optimistic at times, but I do think 2023 if the industry stays disciplined, we will get back into a situation where we can sell a house, now what it's going to go and what are we going to be able to deliver and that will be a good thing. Carl Reichardt : Well, it starts with one house. So I appreciate the color, guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael Rehaut : Great. I appreciate you taking my questions. First off, just wanted to get a sense of the cadence and progression of incentives as it works through your fiscal fourth quarter and into October and perhaps even into November. Obviously, a lot of that, I would presume as being reflected in the first quarter gross margin guidance.  But what I'm trying to get a sense is just the degree of magnitude of the change in trend and how we should be thinking about perhaps where incentives are today versus where they were 3 or 4 months ago? Bill Wheat : It start with just looking -- taking a step back and looking at where interest rates were. At the end of the last quarter, mortgage rates were still in the low to mid-5s. And by the end of the quarter, they're in the high 6s.  And subsequent to the end of the quarter, they've now stepped into the 7s. And so we have been adjusting to reflect that. A lot of our incentives have been on the financing side with interest rate locks and buy downs to try to address the payment shock there from the interest rates. And that has increased sequentially through the quarter and has continued into October. So the levels have continued to increase.  We were focused on ensuring that we could close our backlog because we did have a lot of homes scheduled to close in September. And so we believe we did hold off on some price adjustments to ensure that we could close that backlog. And so price adjustments have started to fold in a little more commonly as we've stepped into Q1. So it's been a sequential increase along the way. And then what it will be going forward will depend largely on what happens with rates in the market and then our efforts to meet the market.  We are looking community by community to make adjustments in order to hit our sales pace and turn our inventory and maximize our returns. And so we're looking to find the market and find that pace community by community. Michael Rehaut : So I guess I appreciate that answer. I know obviously, projecting gross margins beyond the first quarter is somewhat difficult, but it would seem like given the trends that we're not yet at a point of stabilization. I guess my second question, and if you have any thoughts on that, that would be great.I guess  But second question, just on the SG&A guide for the first quarter, with consolidated revenue being a little bit below, obviously, it's not a surprise to see the SG&A come up. I'm also wondering if there's anything in that number around increased broker commissions to the market as part of encouraging the broker community in a softer environment? And how we should be thinking about that line item within SG&A over the next year? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Mike. So builders report those things separately or differently, I should say. So broker commissions for us are actually in gross margin. So that is contemplated as one of the increased incentives in our gross margin guide and not an impact for us, particularly on SG&A. Bill Wheat : And in terms of SG&A overall, with our ASPs expected to come down with revenues down a bit. That's driving an expected increase in our SG&A as a percentage of revenues. We're coming off of all-time lows there and are still positioning ourselves to continue to gain market share.  And so with essentially SG&A spend staying relatively stable with the exception of variable SG&A that moves with revenues or with profitability, that's resulting in the expected increase from all-time lows to a little bit higher level as a percentage of revenues in Q1. Operator : And the next question today is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew Bouley : Just a follow-up on the incentive side. I think I heard you say at the top that within financial services, you were including some , I think you said rate buydowns and things like that. So in the incentive comments you just made around reaching 6 or 7, I think I heard you say -- is that all in the gross margin? And is there additional incentives on the financial services side that we should look out for? Or is that kind of all in? Bill Wheat : There's always some of those costs on both sides, Matt, and that can vary a bit depending on the nature of the incentives. But yes, both of our guides, the guidance for financial services margins going into Q1 as well as the guide for our gross margin on the homebuilding side reflect our anticipation for our level of incentives related to financing. Matthew Bouley : Understood. Okay. And then just secondly, you mentioned that you would -- I think I heard you say you would expect the option abandonments that occurred this quarter to kind of continue to occur. I mean should we expect the magnitude of that to increase? And then just kind of any update on actual impairment thoughts around your own land portfolio? Michael Murray : With the option write-off cost, as we evaluate projects at various decision points, we'll be working with various land sellers and developers and where we can't reach an agreement on our accommodation, we're not going to move forward with a bad deal. So if it doesn't make sense and what we expect the market conditions are or will be over the life of the project, that's the reason we have the option arrangement.  So we may have an increase in those costs, but we do take a pretty accurate look at those things, very realistic expectation, and we'll be very quick to move on those. David Auld : And I'll just add, both when the market was accelerating and now at the center pause, we are very disciplined in how we approach every economic decision on the land side. It's all about creating optionality and efficiency of capital. And that's been our program, and it's going to continue to be our program. Jessica Hansen : In terms of your impairment question, even with our guide for gross margins today, we're still projecting for our gross margins to remain at very healthy levels that would signify that we're a long way off from any sort of broad-based impairments. We're also in a completely different financial position mid-cycle to prior cycles, which allows us some flexibility in terms of how we look at the land that we have on our balance sheet and what we plan to do with it going forward. That being said, we do expect there to be some impairments along the way in weaker submarkets. But right now, I don't expect anything broadly based in the near term. Matthew Bouley : Makes sense. Operator : And the next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from the Cleveland Research Company. Eric Bosshard : Context, if you could, around 2 things. First of all, the 23% to 24% gross margin in 1Q. Obviously, a component of that is what's going on with incentives and pricing. You talked today about savings on the cost side or changing the product mix. And so what I'm trying to understand is, is that a baseline the changes that you're making to support gross margin or change mix, can that number improve?  Can you just give us a little bit of sense of what's contributing to that and in terms of the things you're doing to protect gross margin, what the path forward might look like? Paul Romanowski : Yes, Eric. I think as we are out in the market with our trade partners and suppliers working to reduce cost to provide the best value we can to our homebuyers. And we provided the visibility into the first quarter with those gross margins.  What we're seeing which is encouraging early on in that isn't going to come through in homes to close for the next 6 to 9 months towards the end of the year. So we've still got the homes that we have in the ground with that cost structure -- but as we continue to find the market, we expect to see gross margins like we have guided to in the first quarter. David Auld : And we did suffer through extended bill cycle times. So the houses will be closing in Q1, our houses that were started and bear the cost of high lumber cost. And really trade shortages. So you've got the double whammy of high cost and a more normalized ASP. Eric Bosshard : And just within that, is -- like today, can you comment, is that the floor? Or is there both upside and downside through the rest of the year relative to the 1Q gross margin? David Auld : It depends on what the capital markets and interest rates do. I mean it's -- if we see stabilization in interest rates, I feel very optimistic about what we can do this year. if we continue to see 100 basis point increase quarter-to-quarter to quarter, I think it's going to be a very challenging year. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned single-family for rent, both of what you're doing and buyers of home of your homes from others. I'm just curious if you can give us a sense of how much of the business is single-family for rent, what the expectation is in '23 and if there's any risk or volatility around that buyer group. Michael Murray : So our approach to the single-family rental business is to build communities of traditional single-family homes. Rent those up and stabilization and then sell them to typically institutional owners of that sort of residential asset class. It's about $1.7 billion, I think, is our current investment in the single-family rental platform. We expect that's going to grow during '23.  Depending upon market conditions, probably not more growth than we had from the end of '21 to the end of '22, but we do expect growth in '23. And we still see that when we complete the homes and they go to market to lease, there's still good demand and people are needing a place to live, and they're choosing to live in these communities. Operator : The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Thanks for all the great detail in a difficult market to forecast out here, so we appreciate it. I guess first question, just trying to triangulate all the comments you made about the margin outlook, the goals as far as revenue are concerned in '23. So if I look at your 1Q margin guide, it's down about 600 to 700 basis points from the peak a couple of quarters ago, and I think that's largely consistent with kind of the net price adjustments we've seen across the industry.  As you think about that versus your goal to grow revenues for the year or even maybe the low end of that range, what's the price sensitivity to achieving that goal? How low are you willing to take that margin in the near term, recognizing that maybe longer term, you have some potential cost relief coming or other things that could be offset.  But in order to hit your '23 target there? How low could that margin go before you kind of hold back and say, you know what, we're just going to slow the start pace. We're not going to chase that revenue growth because the price environment is too difficult. Bill Wheat : Alan, there's always a balance. We're always balancing what we're doing on pricing and incentives and what that results in margin versus pace and turning inventory to generate the best return. And so we'll be trying to strike that balance across all our communities throughout the year.  It's too early and too uncertain to know what the year may bring in terms of the macro environment in terms of rates, in terms of the general economy to know exactly what those decisions may need to be. And so that's why we're trying to provide as much color as we can around how we're looking at things, but in reality, we don't have really any specificity or visibility to what those conditions may be into the spring and in to '23 so in terms of where the line is on where margin or pricing might need to go or what we're willing to do to push pace. I think remains to be seen. We're going to be making those decisions day to day, week to week as we march forward here. Jessica Hansen : And as you know, we don't push or dictate that from a high level. It really is managed community by community, market by market so we can make sure we're maximizing our returns at the local level and then blend it overall. Alan Ratner : Okay. I appreciate the thoughts there. I guess on the Rental segment, so I hear the delays in Florida, but I thought I also heard maybe a couple of projects that you thought would close this quarter that got pushed out because of presumably the higher borrowing costs that your counterparties are experiencing and how that impacts the underwriting.  So I guess I'm just thinking out loud here, you do expect growth in that segment and certainly the inventory has been building. But how concerned or not concerned are you about what's going on with borrowing costs for those investors. I mean, we're hearing that there's a bit of a stalemate, if you will, or at least a widening bid-ask spread on the rental side as well given the difficulty underwriting to the new borrowing costs. So what's the sensitivity for you to achieve that growth? Is there any risk to that if borrowing costs remain elevated? Paul Romanowski : Alan, we have certainly seen from that buyer base in the credit markets and their ability to borrow soften, but there's still plenty of buyers out there. Like our buyers on the homebuyer side, they're taking a bit of a pause in some cases, just to evaluate the market.  But we've got about 7,400 homes in production on the single-family for rent side, and that's from beginning to those that are complete. We still expect to see people in that market. Not everyone needs to be in the credit markets or borrowing to purchase. And our single-family rental communities tend to be on the lower end side relative to apartment sizes.  And so we still feel good about that business, but we certainly did see communities that we expected to be sold and closed in the fourth quarter pushed into the second quarter.So... Alan Ratner : And when you look at your deals that are under construction or completed or close and if you underwrite those deals as if you're a buyer today, you're still seeing those penciling. In other words, you can make the math work and assume that a buyer theoretically can as well? Paul Romanowski : Yes. And we have been very conservative on our underwriting. We are really looking at each of those communities as we would on the for-sale side. And so the performance we saw on the ones that we sold in the market a year ago and through the last year, were far outperformed our underwriting. And so we still feel good about the position in the active communities that we have, and we will adjust as the market adjusts in terms of that business on a go forward. Michael Murray : And more of the issue, I think, Alan, related to a change in that buyer. They were -- just to say they were very excited would be an understatement to get their hands on the communities early in fiscal '22. We experienced some of the same construction delays in those products that we did in our single-family for sale business and we had expectations and buyer indications of interest willing to close on the projects prior to completion and prior to full stabilization. The markets come back and more normalized now and their expectation is that we get to a stabilized point before they're -- we're going to get a good valuation. Alan Ratner : If I could just sneak in one last one, and I apologize, but it's relevant to this topic here. In the environment where the capital markets remain tough and the borrowing costs continue to rise here, but you're still seeing good fundamentals at the community level, good occupancy, good rents. Are you willing to kind of shift the strategy in the near term and kind of hold on to more of these assets on your balance sheet and wait for the transaction environment to improve? Or is the goal here really to turn the capital and then you're not looking to necessarily grow a portfolio of stabilized assets? Bill Wheat : Our base business model is to sell the assets. That still generally will generate the best return. But we're going to make sure that we stay in a position from a capital perspective to be able to manage timing to manage a bit of a slower process, if necessary, due to some disruptions in the capital markets, which typically don't last that long. But we do want to make sure we stay in a flexible position to be able to manage timing when necessary. Operator : Your next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck Horne : I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned the cancellation rate in October remained elevated. I was just wondering if directionally you could indicate whether that was the cancellation rate was higher or lower than what happened in the fourth quarter in October. Jessica Hansen : Yes. We typically have volatility month-to-month in our can rate throughout the quarter, so we don't give it specifically for the month. But anything for us above the, call it, low 20s, high teens to low 20s is elevated, and we certainly did not see any market improvement in October as compared to Q4. Buck Horne : Okay. Appreciate that. And can we talk about any just regional differences in terms of how buyer traffic and interest levels have behaved as the progression of interest rates kind of marched higher either during the quarter through October. Just kind of walk us through the map and just kind of where things are -- how buyers are behaving in different geographies? Michael Murray : We've seen still see a lot of traffic in our models. We still see people coming in looking to get into a home, a little more challenging with the affordability sometimes to get them qualified. But as we see stabilization in rates. And when we see periods when rates have stabilized and that demand is there, we're able to meet it.  We do see in our sales process is that we're selling the large majority of our homes passed a certain stage of construction, not just from our restriction of that sale, but from the buyer wanting certainty of what that interest rate payment can be within the lock window that can be afforded to them.  And so that's been important for us to accelerate the cycle times, have more inventoried later in the production process that we can deliver within the interest rate lock window. Buck Horne : Right. I'm just curious, pockets of strength kind of geographically? David Auld : Just from geographically, it's the same markets that are experienced in inflow of buyers. I mean, I think our relocate percentage relocation buyers picked up last quarter again -- there is -- it's -- the market is, I think, evolving maybe is the best word.  There is still a migration out of urban or out of urban into the suburbs. And there's still housing formation taking place that exceeds the supply of homes. It's easy to get caught up in the short term. Our goal here is to stay focused on the long term. And I can tell you, our efforts are in positioning for now Q2, Q3, Q4 and '24 and '25.  And so we're trying to stay out of the short-term reaction, but where do we want to be as this platform continues to develop, improve and get built out. Operator : The next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is going back to the land market a bit. Can you talk about what you're hearing from the sellers? And how are the renegotiations of some of those option contracts coming together. What is the pushback that you're getting if there is any? And how is that progressing and changing as the market is changing? Paul Romanowski : Yes, Susan. We have been very proactive with our land sellers and development partners and realistic in terms of expectations with the market as it moves. So largely, they have the understanding and working with us to keep those deals alive where we can. To the extent that it just the underwriting doesn't make sense. Then we're having to make the decisions that we are. And we will, if needs be, have to walk away from some of those options. But that's why we have the option contracts in place and have made that shift with our land strategy. But by and large, they are reading the headlines like everyone else and understanding of where the market is. They ultimately want to be in a position to move through those lots and so have been relatively well received and receptive to come to the Table Talk. David Auld : And we treat our attempt to treat our development partners like they're part of the family. I mean, we're very transparent. They understand where we're headed and what our start pace is and what our expectations for that community is.  And coming out of the last downturn, we built relationships that are still existing today and our goals in every community, every division is to be kind of the favorite nation builder. And we are going to treat them better. So we really do believe in the transparency and consistency and audit and direct communication, and that's how you build relationships. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. And then can you talk a bit about capital allocation? As the market is changing, how are you thinking about the different uses of cash and especially maybe any thoughts on buybacks as we think about 2023? Bill Wheat : Yes, Sue, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to it all. We're in a good, flexible position to be able to continue to provide returns to our shareholders, both in the terms of increased dividends and share repurchases. Obviously, we'll be adjusting in our business and how much we invest into land and to help home starts and into our rental business based on market conditions.  But at a base level, we do expect to generate an increase in our homebuilding cash from operations in fiscal 2023. And with that, that gives us even more flexibility to make those relative decisions, but continue with more of the same in terms of the balance and the consistency in the approach. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions this morning. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to David Auld for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everybody's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our first quarter results in January. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family for another remarkable year. Stay humble, stay hungry, stay focused, go compete and win every day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America\u2019s Builder, the largest builder in the United States. There will be an opportunity to ask questions on today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] During today\u2019s Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul, and good morning.

Before we get started, today\u2019s call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call and D.R Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is filled with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning\u2019s earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q tomorrow. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team delivered a solid first quarter, highlighted by earnings of $2.76 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.3 billion, on a 3% increase in revenue with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.5%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31 was 39.5% and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 31.5%. Beginning in June 2022 and continuing through today, we have seen a moderation in housing demand due to affordability challenges caused by the significant rise in mortgage rates, coupled with high inflation and general economic uncertainty. Despite these pressures, we still closed over 17,000 homes and sold more than 13,000 homes in what is typically the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. We have seen increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January. While higher mortgage rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and resale homes at a portable price points remains limited, and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate the current challenging market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great creative supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on turning our inventory and managing our product offerings, incentives, home pricing, sales pace and inventory levels to meet market, optimize returns, consolidate market share and generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 13% to $2.76 per diluted share compared to $3.17 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 16% to $958.7 million, on a 3% increase in consolidated revenues to $7.3 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $6.7 billion, on 17,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 18,396 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $386,900, up 7% from the prior year quarter and down 4% sequentially. Paul? Paul Romanowski : During the quarter, we continued to sell homes later in the construction cycle to better ensure the certainty of the home close date and mortgage rate for our home buyers with almost no sales occurring prior to start of home construction. Our cancellation rate for the first quarter was 27%, down from 32% sequentially, but still elevated from our typical levels. Our net sales orders in the first quarter decreased 38% to 13,382 homes, and our order value decreased 40% from the prior year to $4.9 million. Our average number of active selling communities increased 4% from the prior year quarter and was down 1% sequentially. The average sales price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $367,900, down 4% from the prior year quarter. We are continuing to offer mortgage interest rate locks and buy-downs and other incentives to drive traffic to our communities, and we are reducing home prices where necessary to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. Our second quarter sales volume will depend on the strength of its spring selling season, and we currently expect significantly higher levels of net sales orders in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter based on historical seasonal trends, current market conditions and our inventory of completed homes available for sale. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 23.9%, down 440 basis points sequentially from the September quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 4% sequentially, stick-and-brick cost per square foot increased 2% and lock costs were flat. The decrease in our gross margin from September to December was in line with our expectations and reflects the increased construction costs we incurred during 2022, along with higher sales incentives and home price reductions. We expect both our average sales price and home sales gross margin to decrease further in our second quarter for fiscal 2023. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making progress in these efforts, but we do not expect to see much benefit from lower costs on homes closed in fiscal 2023. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.8%, up 30 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. We are controlling our SG&A during this market transition while ensuring our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We slightly increased our home starts from the last quarter to 13,900 homes and ended the quarter with 43,200 homes in inventory, down 21% from a year-ago and down 7% sequentially. 27,800 of our homes at December 31 were unsold, of which 7,100 were completed. We are focused on improving our housing inventory turnover. With more completed homes not available for sale, we expect our mix of homes sold and closed in the same quarter to increase back towards our normal historical levels. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time fully increased by a few days compared to fourth quarter, which reflects lingering supply chain issues. However, we are seeing some stabilization in cycle times on homes that we have recently started and we expect the cycle times to improve during fiscal 2023. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike? Mike Murray : Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 551,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. Our total homebuilding lot position decreased by 22,000 lots from September to December. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We continually underwrite all of our lot and land purchases based on future expected home prices and cost. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land, and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our Homebuilding segment incurred $4.8 million of inventory impairments and wrote off $19.4 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain elevated in fiscal 2023 as we manage our lot portfolio. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $1.7 billion, down 21% from the prior year quarter and up 16% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $900 million for finished lots, $690 million for land development, and $130 million to acquire land. Bill? Bill Wheat : Financial services pre-tax income in the first quarter was $18.2 million on $137 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit conversion of 13.3%. The lower profitability of our financial services business this quarter was primarily due to lower gains on sales and mortgages, increased competitive conditions, and a lower volume of interest rate lots by homebuyers during the December quarter. We expect our financial services to pre-tax profit margin for fiscal 2023 to be higher than the first quarter, but lower than the full year of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter, 99% from mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed to buyer home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our homebuyers. FHA and VA loans are accounted for 45% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 7.2 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our rental operations generated $328 million of revenues during the first quarter from the sale of 694 single-family rental homes and 300 multi-family rental units, earning pre-tax income of $110 million. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $2.9 billion, which included approximately $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1 billion of multi-family rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the second quarter, we currently expect no multifamily rental sales and to close fewer single-family rental homes than in the first quarter. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $216.7 million on 2,263 lots sold and pre-tax income of $27.9 million for the first quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,300 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $190 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $580 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 28.7%. Forestar is well-positioned to meet the current challenging market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity to provide a firm foundation for our operated platforms during changes in market conditions and to support our ability to provide consistent returns to our shareholders. During the first three months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $313.9 million, and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $829.1 million. At December 31st, we had $4 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Our liquidity provides significant flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. Our homebuilding leverage was 12.8% at the end of December, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 4.4%. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 22% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 13.3%. At December 31st, our stockholders' equity was $20.2 billion and book value per share was $58.71, up 33% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 31.5%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $86.1 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in February. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $118.1 million. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. We are providing detailed guidance for the second quarter as is our standard practice, but it is still too early to know what housing market conditions will be during the height of the spring selling season, so we are not providing specific guidance for the full year yet. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our March quarter of $6.3 billion to $6.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 16,000 to 17,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 20% to 21% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 8% to 8.3%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 20%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24% in the second quarter. We are well positioned to aggregate market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations. Our goal remains to generate consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023 or slightly higher than fiscal 2022. However, it is realistic to expect that our full year revenues will decline year-over-year, given the environment and pricing actions we are taking. The low end of our current range of expectations includes consolidated revenues down from fiscal 2022 by a mid-teens percentage, which is unchanged from last quarter. We forecast an income tax rate for the year of approximately 23.5% to 24%. We expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations and on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. We also plan to repurchase shares at a similar dollar amount as last year to reduce our share count during this year with the volume of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities. We have $700 million of senior notes that matured during the remainder of fiscal 2023, which we are currently preparing to repay from cash. We plan to continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and positions reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and hard work. We are incredibly well positioned to continue improving our operations in providing homeownership opportunities to more American families. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. You may go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just want to ask about inventory, unsold inventory. So about two-thirds of the inventory that you've got now is unsold. I think normally, it's about half when I went back and looked, so I just want to make sure, should we be optimistic because you've got product ready to go for the spring or in the supply chain perhaps is normalizing a little which is allowing you to get that ready or should we be more pessimistic because you haven't necessarily price that inventory to move yet? That's my first question. David Auld : Well, Carl, as you know, I'm always optimistic. We feel very good about our inventory position. And you know, through the last three, four quarters, we limited sales to better align inventory cost demand and our ability to deliver. We are now positioned more in what I would consider a normalized inventory position and again, feel very good about our position and where we're heading into this quarter. Mike Murray : Normally coming into the spring selling season, we'd be a little heavier than our normal 50% spec ratio. But feel really good about what we have in front of us right now for demand. Carl Reichardt : Okay. And then -- I was looking at the market count now we're about 109 markets and say four years ago, I think you were about 80 or so, that's a lot. And obviously, you all benefited post-COVID by entering a lot of smaller markets that saw a fair amount of demand, post the pandemic. Now that that wave is potentially crested, can you talk about how some of the new, especially, the smaller what I call the tertiary city markets are performing over the course of the last six months? Are they better than some of the major markets less competitors, or is that growth beginning to wane now that we've seen a little more return to office back to the large cities? Thanks, guys. Paul Romanowski : Carl, we've seen these newer markets and secondary markets performing well for us due to limited competition in those markets. We certainly saw a strong push to all the secondary markets with a pandemic moving people making them more mobile that we've been happy with the progression in the secondary markets and glad that we entered them. David Auld : You know, Carl, even before the pandemic, we did very well in the small markets. And ultimately, it comes back to SG&A and control and the ability to deliver houses incrementally add a competitive advantage to what anybody else out there is able to do. So, that - that's been a part of our program and I think you're going to see continue to be a part of our program. Carl Reichardt : Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. Want to ask about the construction cost environment, I think I heard you say at the top that you were making some progress, but I'm paraphrasing but perhaps not expecting to see as much benefit on the construction cost side on homes close through fiscal 2023? Obviously, some of your peers have sort of quantified, some of the benefits they might already be seeing on the construction cost side. So, just curious if you can parse that out a little bit as you guys sort of aggregate market share as we think about your ability to press on costs here? Thank you. Mike Murray : We've been really successful working with a lot of our trade partners in lowering our cost. And we've gotten a little bit of tailwind from certainly from the lumber price reductions that have occurred, but it just takes a while for those cost changes on the front end to actually show up in the closing, especially with the more recently prolonged build times. So, it's just a function of the calendar working those new cost structures through the pipeline. So, the deliveries we see in 2023 were largely, first half of the year especially started in fiscal 2022 in a different cost environment. Jessica Hansen : And typically, lumber prices go up as we move throughout the spring. So although we're seeing a benefit from lumber today, if typical seasonality holds, lumber would actually be a headwind against the cost reductions that we are seeing on those new home starts that Mike just alluded to. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Gotcha. Thank you for that color. And then second one, just kind of following up around the pricing environment. As you've seen sort of some of your peers enacted, I guess, different strategies around pricing versus pace here. And perhaps as we get into the spring, we might expect to see some builders on the ground react more aggressively on the pricing side versus -- I would argue you guys have been leading that first, I guess. So as we get into the spring, sort of, what are your expectations or perhaps what are you seeing on the ground right now around your competition and price reductions and would you expect to see another leg lower on the pricing and margin side through all that? Thank you. David Auld : We have still addressed our incentives with a balance of rate buy-downs, financial incentives, along with adjusting price community by community to drive the returns that we're looking for. As we enter into the spring selling season, we're seeing some seasonality that we're happy with as the market starts to lead and we'll continue to adjust to drive the absorptions by community. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thank you very much, and good luck. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is you mentioned the first few weeks of January saw increased activity, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on that and maybe frame it sequentially or year-over-year? And how were incentives in the first few weeks of January relative to December? Jessica Hansen : Yeah. So we talked about on the call that we do expect to see normal seasonality in terms of the move from Q1 to Q2 sales. And so what we saw in terms of the increased sales activity in the first few weeks of January was a positive early indicator. It is still too early to ultimately say what's going to happen this spring, but it gave us the confidence to say that we could see normal seasonality, which typically would be about 50% up from Q1 to Q2 in terms of net sales orders. We also did see a slight improvement, it\u2019s only a few weeks, which doesn't make a quarter, but we've seen a slight improvement in our cancellation rate in January as well, which also helps give us the confidence to say an increased level of net sales orders in Q2 versus Q1. John Lovallo : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe could we talk just about cash flow expectations. It seems like it's going to be pretty robust here. I mean you're buying back stock, paying dividends, paying down $700 million in debt. So maybe just your expectations for cash flow and what the expectation for rental investment might be? David Auld : Yeah, we still expect increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations in fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022. We saw our inventory step down slightly this quarter. We will be increasing our start pace as we move into the spring and then adjusting that to what we see in market demand. So we may not continue to see the same pace of cash generation as we did in our first quarter, but we do still expect to see robust cash. And then we're going to continue to take our balanced approach to deploying that first foremost of the homebuilding business next to the rental business. We will still see a substantial increase in our assets in the rental business this year, we're not guiding to a specific growth number there quite yet for fiscal 2023 because we're still evaluating the market and evaluating investments as we move through the year, but we do expect that level of inventory to increase while we see a significant increase in revenues in that business. And then past that, we will continue to pay dividends and continue to repurchase shares. We expect to repurchase shares at a similar dollar volume as last year, which would indicate greater than $1 billion of share repurchases for fiscal 2023. And then finally, on the balance sheet front, while we're very pleased with our leverage level, we do have $700 million of senior notes that mature in fiscal 2023, 300 million in February, 400 million in August. And currently, just given the overall environment and our cash flow expectations, we're preparing to pay those debt to maturities off with from cash. But obviously, we'll evaluate capital markets along the way to determine whether we want to refinance or not. But right now, preparing to pay those from cash. John Lovallo : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Lots of good information. I wanted to follow up on, I think, Matt's question regarding the cost negotiations, though. I think last quarter, you had suggested that you could see the benefit starting to certainly from repositioning your product at least to benefit you by your fiscal third quarter I was just wondering whether or not that process is maybe taking a little longer or if that was sort of separate from your comments on the \u2013 the labor and product negotiations. And then in your answer to him, I think you also sort of mentioned or volunteered that you were sort of assuming lumber costs were going to increase. And I just wanted to get a sense, how much of an assumption or -- how much of an increase are you assuming you might see in lumber? Are you sort of just conservatively modeling it might go like halfway back to where it was last year. Just give us a sense for what you're incorporating in your outlook for lumber, knowing that you don't know yet, obviously. David Auld : Most importantly, we don't know. And we're taking probably a conservative stance in looking at the fact that seasonally in a normal seasonal environment, we do see lumber cost increase through the spring -- and if we do -- are seeing some normalized demand coming back with the spring selling season, seasonality, would expect that to drive lumber prices higher, which would offset some of the efforts we've made on like-for-like cost reductions. We have been able to get new product starts out, new home starts out that are more reflected to today's environment, smaller homes, more affordable homes that should help -- but in terms of a like-for-like cost benefit increase, it's going to take a little while for that product to move through the system in a material way. Stephen Kim : I didn't hear a number there. I think I was getting ready to write a number down. I didn't hear a number. You want to give us a sense or sort of like how much of the way back just sort of thinking lumber might increase. Yes. David Auld : We don't have a sense for a number, Steve, I'm sorry. We're not that good at predicting. We're just taking a conservative approach that seasonally lumber tends to go up in the spring. And that's probably going to have an impact on our cost and our deliveries later in the year. Bill Wheat : It does feel Stephen, like there is some normalcy returning to the market. And so you go back pre-pandemic and you look at what happened \u2013 costs get inflated during the last year, 18 months? Yes. Are we fighting get that back? Yes. our commodity price like lumber may go up, may go down, may stay the same. But are we going to be conservative in our guidance? Absolutely, we are. Stephen Kim : No complaints here. And I'll say that if lumber goes up because of normalization, I think we'll take it. In regards to your lot count, I noticed that your owned lot count in numbers -- numbers of lots went up a little bit. I think quarter-on-quarter, it had declined, I believe, in the last two quarters preceding that. So, I'm curious, are you -- or at least in the last -- sorry, the last two quarters preceding that, are you -- do you feel like your lot cost -- sorry, your lots owned will increase from here, or do you think we might actually see a further reduction in your actual number of owned lots? Just try to give us a sense for what that number might be, not in year supply but more like in absolute units? David Auld : Yes, Stephen. We have worked hard for the lot position that we have and the relationships that we've built and with those developer relationships, we're continuing to -- it's still hard to get a lot on the graph. And so our lot count as a percentage of owned and total numbers, we expect to continue to increase -- and some of that will depend on what we see with the spring selling season and through the rest of fiscal 2023. But we don't expect that to go down and we expect to see potentially our owned lot supply as a percent increase marginally through this market. Jessica Hansen : And as a reference, again, our owned lots finished percentage is only 32%, which is roughly 43,000 lots. So, we're by no means oversupplied from a finished lot perspective, which is what we're trying to continue to position ourselves forward community-by-community. Stephen Kim : Got you. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike your line is live. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to circle back to your more recent trend and demand comments. Obviously, you mentioned that the first few weeks of January, saw some increased activity and that you could see a typical 50% improvement in orders in 2Q versus 1Q. That would imply if we're to take that just on a straightforward basis an order decline of only roughly 20% down year-over-year. So, I'm curious around if that's kind of -- and I know you haven't given hard guidance or a range. But directionally, if that's how we should be thinking about things? And also to this point around the improvement that you saw in January, I was curious also if you could kind of give any color around trends intra-quarter during the past first quarter, if that improvement in January was a continuation of perhaps a change in trend that you saw during your December quarter? Jessica Hansen : I would say during the December quarter, as we mentioned on the call, as you know, Mike, is the seasonally slowest quarter of the year. So, we generally don't extrapolate anything that happens in October, November, and December, and we don't generally give a whole lot of monthly color, but we felt like based on current market conditions that warranted talking about the first few weeks of January, and that's what we're pleased with is we've seen what we would typically expect to see as we move through these first few weeks. David Auld : In terms of the math that you laid out. If we do see that normal seasonality, yes, it still would result in net sales down year-over-year, but up very nicely sequentially. Mike Rehaut : Right. And secondly, I know there's been a couple of questions around the construction costs and the impact there. I think that's been covered pretty well. Obviously, another big part is the gross margin guidance for the second quarter, and you're expecting further declines. I wanted to also focus though on pricing trends in the market. And if you could give us a sense of on a total basis, how much net pricing has come down from June of last year to today? And how much of that has occurred in the last month or two? Bill Wheat : In terms of just pricing, really, our net sales orders in the quarter and the average sales price on that is the best indication. Our net sales order price this quarter is around 367,000, I believe. And, of course, we peaked last year, a little over 400,000. So you're already looking at roughly a 10% decline in our net sales orders. And as then we look at our margin guide going forward, we're taking recent pricing into effect. We're hopeful that if we see some normal seasonality and normal demand during the spring that further significant pricing reductions would not be necessary, but we're going to assess that week-to-week and month-to-month as we go through the spring. But our gross margin guide takes into account recent pricing along with the cost trends that we've already been discussing. David Auld : Just to add, it is very hard to put a lot on the ground. It's very hard to build houses. And the overall market is still undersupplied. So long-term, I think we've got a great outlook what happens in the next quarter. We're going to deal with the market as it comes. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Truman Patterson : Hey good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, has the land market started to capitulate at all on takedown pricing with your alls, ASPs down kind of 8% quarter-over-quarter. Are you actually starting to see the land market correct at all with more meaningful price declines, or is it still just too early to tell? Bill Wheat : I think generally, it's still a little too early Truman. Land is typically one of the stickier parts of the process. And as David and Paul both mentioned earlier in the call, it is increasingly difficult to get a lot entitled and on the ground. And so that is something that has held up pretty well. But anecdotally, there are situations where we're able to make some progress on the land residual with some of our land sellers. But not broad trends yet, for sure. Truman Patterson : Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then you all made a recent acquisition in Arkansas. Could you all just, kind of, walk through the drivers of that purchase? And are you seeing more small privates, their willingness to sell at a relatively attractive valuation pop-up given the market slowdown? Bill Wheat : Yeah. The acquisition of Riggins in Northwest Arkansas gave us -- not I want to say, an entrance into the market. We were in there with a couple of communities, but gave us a solid position in a market that has remained strong with good employment growth and limited housing supply again to the earlier question of the secondary markets, a solid market that we are happy to be in. It was a good acquisition and tuck-in for us with a well-established community with a great lot of supply. And so gave us immediate inventory and homes in progress, well-respected builder in the market that we're happy to as part of the family. As far as other acquisitions, we continue to look at those -- and where we have tuck-in opportunities similar to this, we had things that we would explore but no broad-based change in how we look at builders and margin. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you all. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Two things. First of all, the 40% reduction in starts, I'm curious if there's -- what the discipline or logic is in what you're not starting if there's buckets of this. You mentioned trying to change the product a bit to fit a price point. But curious if there's something to learn from how you're making those decisions of where you're reducing starts. David Auld : A lot of our starts decisions are made within the quarter on the basis of what the sales trends are occurring at that point in time. And certainly, through late summer and into the fall, our first quarter, mortgage rates spiking up, cancellations increasing, looking at our current inventory positions neighborhood by neighborhood relative to recent sales paces, certainly led us to slow down our starts. Coming into this fiscal \u2013 this calendar year into the second quarter, seeing some improvement in our cycle time and supply chain issues unsnarling, and we feel like we'll be able to start homes and complete them in a more timely fashion this year. So we did -- we are trying to meter our starts out a little bit to more closely match our sales demand right now. Bill Wheat : And Eric I think its just \u2013 I think it's just indicative of the entire industry and lessons learned in the last downturn. I mean I do believe that there is a discipline around the industry, and it's not just short-term, chase every market every day. So it's -- we're trying to do a lot in inventory levels with demand. And it ultimately comes back to if you look at the long-term position of the industry, there aren't enough lots for houses for the population and demand that we see taking place over the next three to five years. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then related to this, the inventory per community number, it looks like it's up. And I guess the follow-on would be the path forward with starts from here is down 40 a pace you maintain for another quarter and then lift your heads up, or how do you think about the pace of managing the supply path going forward? David Auld : I think we saw the starts kind of align with our sales pace in the quarter, and I think we're going to look to try to maintain that relationship through this time of the year as we're seeing good sales demand in the early spring selling season, we'll be replacing those homes with new starts to continue having inventory in the shelf available to sell. We are certainly seeing more homes selling later in the construction process, certainty of delivery date, certainty of mortgage rate and payment are big important factors for our buyers. And we're also focusing very heavily on recovering our housing inventory turnover metrics and getting more efficient with those inventory dollars. Got to get our returns back up on our housing inventory. Jessica Hansen : And so as with everything, our starts are managed community by community, market by market by our local operators to focus on not piling up excess completed homes that have been sitting there for an extended period of time. Eric Bosshard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony your line is live. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Can you talk about the tenure of buyers who canceled this quarter? Were those contracts that were signed in fiscal 4Q or maybe even earlier? Is there a larger cohort of buyers who may be placed orders in the fall, but are still at risk of cancellation with rates rising? Just wondering if you can give any color around kind of cancellation trends there? Paul Romanowski : I think as you've seen, our cancellation trend moderate and cancellation rate moderate, we have younger backlog that have signed contracts more recently. As Mike spoke to, certainty of home close date and mortgage rate is very important. So, as we have cycled through and we're improving our housing inventory turns, I think that's where you're seeing our reduction in cancellation rate. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of renegotiating prices for homes in backlog, has that sort of normalized or died down now that rates have stopped rising and to your point, cancellations have come down? Bill Wheat : Hopefully, with the rate stabilization we've seen -- we'll see stabilization in incentives and pricing environment going forward. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck, your line is live. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. I wonder if I could dive in a little bit more on the incentives that are out there, the tools that you're using out in the field, it sounds like a lot of builders are having some success with a mortgage rate buy-down program. where you're buying down or fixing the mortgage rate below market for sounds like for the life of the loan, it seems to be popular out there. I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on -- are you using mortgage rate buy-downs? How does that mechanically work? And kind of what does that cost you in terms of upfront margin hit or as a percentage of sales? David Auld : Yes, Buck, we do, as an ordinary course use mortgage rate buy-downs and many of those are for the life of the loan. That's been a program we've had in quite place for quite some time. The costs do vary from time to time, depending on market conditions and timing of when you tie up those positions. But that's something that we try to make sure that we have in the toolbox for our salespeople is to be able to offer an attractive mortgage rates to buyers who come in. Buck Horne : Okay. Would you say that that's the most effective sales tool at the moment is a buy-down or are you using some other level of incentives? David Auld : It's going to vary community-by-community and over time as to what the most attractive incentive is, and we try to put a lot of tools in our division operators' hands to make the best decisions about what's going to motivate and drive their realtor and buyer traffic in their communities and excite our sales agents with a reason to call and a reason to drive some traffic this week. So, it might be a little bit of a pricing adjustment on a few homes. It might be the rate buy-down, some mortgage financing incentives have been very popular, very heavily utilized. And it might be that supply chain is working back out that we're back to a washer-dryer Wednesdays. I mean there's plenty of incentives out there that we're going to use to drive a pace to hit a return we need to hit at every given neighborhood. Buck Horne : Okay. Thank you. And one quick separate topic on single-family rentals and the -- it sounds like the guidance quarter-over-quarter is slightly lower in terms of projected sales of single-family rental homes. I'm wondering if that's strategic to hold back the pace of those sales. And just curious what the demand is like in the marketplace for and/or the pricing for stabilized SFR homes these days? David Auld : It's just timing of projects and when they'll be ready -- completed and ready and through a sale process. We'll just have fewer this quarter ready to close than we had this past quarter. Mike Murray : The first quarter benefited from a few projects that were lined up to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 had some storm impact and delayed some timing of a few closings there. So that 1Q number was probably a little higher than the original production sales schedule is set up for. David Auld : The business model is still complete lease-up market and so. Jessica Hansen : And you're starting to see some level of closings each and every quarter, but it is still choppy here in the earlier stages, and we would expect that to become more consistent over time as we get further along with the lots and the houses we have under construction. Buck Horne : Awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was hoping maybe you could just help me a little bit reconciling the closings results versus the orders. The closings for this quarter came in well above your guidance. The orders were a bit lighter versus what you signaled in mid-November. And I thought I heard you say that cycle times have been relatively stable, maybe even ticked up a little bit. So how did you drive the upside to closings without stronger order activity? Was it just that much of a greater mix of completed sales versus homes that were a month or two out from completion than you were anticipating? And I'm sure that ties into the 2Q guidance as well with your delivery guidance above your beginning backlog. So I'm just maybe looking for a little bit more color to understand what's going on there? David Auld : Yeah. As we see marginal improvement in our inventory turns and home construction times, you're starting to see and you see that in our numbers, a larger percentage of our inventory homes on the completed side, which allows us to meet the market, which quite frankly is available to us today, which is shorter-term close. And so we're seeing more homes sell and close in the quarter, getting back more towards historical norms, and we expect to see that on a go-forward basis with the maturity of the home inventory that we have. Alan Ratner : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Second question, kind of, related, but tying in maybe the margin conversation as well. So when you look at your 7,000 completed specs, are you able to provide a little bit more detail on how many of those are maybe less than 30 days completed? What's more than 30? And how is your pricing strategy differ on completed specs as it hits certain threshold? Is there a level or a point where you get more aggressive on price adjustments, or do you just look at it more holistically? David Auld : So generally, we talk about a completed spec, we have a pretty aggressive definition of what's completed, it's when it gets into the final flooring stage. So typically, from a home hitting that completion milestone for us, normal conditions, it's probably going to take between two weeks to four weeks for that home actually to be moving ready and more likely to the four-week side of that. So if we look at how many houses we have out there that are aging in the buckets, we have about 190 houses that have been passed our completion date by more than six months or more. So we still feel very comfortable about the freshness of that spec inventory, and this is the exact right time of the year to have that inventory, especially with the backdrop of very low existing home sale inventory available in the marketplace. Bill Wheat : And that's something we manage very closely. Obviously, we've been building specs for a very long time. We have a lot of discipline around that. And so we do watch those completed specs as they start to age. And they get longer if they get longer than 90 days, then yes, we will start to step up the efforts to ensure that we move them. But right now, we still have a very fresh \u2013 fresh batch of completed specs out there for springs selling season. Alan Ratner : Great. Appreciate that. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live. Mike Dahl : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So the first one, just to follow up on the margin discussion. I understand there's not a lot of forward guidance you're going to get beyond this next quarter and a level of uncertainty. I'm wondering just as you see it today, if you look at your current orders, as you look at what you're expecting to sell in the quarter versus kind of the timing of some backlog still coming through in that gross margin that will be reported in fiscal 2Q. How should we be thinking about the likely cadence of margin beyond 2Q? Is it still barring some quick improvement in the market, going to be lower as you cycle off your backlog and into the recent sales as you get into fiscal 3Q, or any color on that? Bill Wheat : Mike, we're only guiding to Q2 margin. And the reason we're only guiding to Q2 margin is we don't know what margins or what the environment will be beyond Q2. The spring selling season, obviously, we've got some early encouraging signs but we don't know what their conditions will be at the height of the spring selling season. So we have visibility to where our margins and our sales and our backlog and our pricing and our costs are today heading into the quarter but even Q2 had some level of uncertainty to it. We would expect to sell and close 40% of our closings in the same quarter in the coming quarters. So while we believe that there's some possibility of some stability in the market with mortgage rates stable that could change this afternoon. And so right now, we're giving you what we get -- what we have. So our guidance for margins of 20% to 21% is what we can see today for Q2. There is some risk, both upside and downside there. I would say it's possible we could beat that range. But it's certainly possible that we might not. But past Q2, we simply don't have visibility right now. Jessica Hansen : We're going to continue to meet the market and do what we need to do to maximize returns community by community. Mike Dahl : Okay. Fair enough. And then my second question, there's been a lot in the press around Arizona, in particular, tightening up on some of the water rights and kind of permitting or lack of issuing permits in certain parts of the Phoenix, Metro area given some of the requirements around water usage. You guys obviously had your Vidler acquisition last year. I think they do have some projects in Arizona. Can you give us a sense of if the counties or municipalities are just outright refusing to issue permits to certain areas, does your \u2013 does your ownership of Vidler and the projects in those regions exempt you from that? Are you able to still get permits for your planned projects, or any color on what you're seeing there would be, I think, interesting in light of some of the press that's been out there? David Auld : Well, yes, I think there has been a lot in the press on water and water is and will continue to be a headwind throughout the West, not just in Arizona. And certainly, our acquisition and integration of Vidler has helped our positioning and that's really some benefit to the short-term, but mostly a long-term strategic decision on our part, knowing that we're going to head these -- facing these headwinds for the foreseeable future. I don't think there's been a significant change on a local basis. It's still difficult to get lots on the ground to get entitlements through the process and to get those permits. It has been for a while, and that continues. So, we feel good about our position -- the lot positions we have in the Phoenix market and we've got a great team on board there that continues to navigate through that environment. Mike Dahl : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Jay your line is live. Jay McCanless : Hey, good morning everyone. So, Bill going back to what you talked about looking to close 40 -- or so and closed 40% of the 2Q closings. I guess, how in, say, pre-COVID times, what would that percentage have been in normal Q2? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Jay. Our typical percentage, we're in just pretty consistently up until the last year or two in the 35% to 40% range. A quarter ago, we were in the high teens. A year ago, it was even lower than that. And this quarter, we were roughly 34%. So, when we talk about reverting to normal, we started to see that reversion in the first quarter, but we expect that to continue to tick up. So, whether it's actually 40% or closer to the 35%, 36%, we don't know. But typically, 35% to 40% would be a pretty consistent range for us. Jay McCanless : Okay. And then the second question I had, assuming you pay down the $1 billion in debt like you've talked about. Any idea of what benefit that might be to gross margin since it's going to be less amortized interest or interest being amortized? Bill Wheat : Yes, Jay, we have $700 million of homebuilding notes that mature this year and right now we plan to do to pay those off with cash. That's out of just under $3 billion of homebuilding debt. So, roughly 25% of the balance would be paid down that if we do not replace that debt, that would reduce our interest carry in time. That benefit would really primarily be probably noticed in fiscal 2024 and beyond because it takes time for the interest to be capitalized and move their inventory. But it would take our interest carry down probably 20, 30 basis points as a percentage of margin over time -- longer term benefit. Jay McCanless : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Bill Wheat : Thanks Jay. Operator : Thank you. And in the interest of time today, the last question will be coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the rental side. What are you seeing in terms of demand? And margins have been really strong last year and obviously this quarter. Just do you anticipate any type of normalization going forward, or do you think you'll have to hold those properties longer if demand comes down? David Auld : I think we're still seeing demand for the properties. I think the pricing and the margins we realized on our early project sales benefited from construction and lower construction cost environments coupled with a very attractive rate environment when we sold those and that continued to some degree into our first quarter deliveries, we would expect to see some kind of a more normalized reversion to demand to a mean. And I think we'll see our margins come back in line to be closer to slightly above on what we're seeing on for sale side, the traditional core sales side. But our business model is to develop the communities and sell them into the marketplace. That's what we do best, finding the land, building the homes and bringing people to those communities is what we've been very successful with so far. So still learning, still going to get better, but we do like that business. Rafe Jadrosich : And then just one more on the -- in terms of the improvement in demand that you're seeing in the quarter and quarter outlook for orders in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Can you talk about what you think is driving the stronger demand? Is it the fact that mortgage rates have come down a little bit? Is there anything happening with consumer confidence what's giving you that confidence in supporting the view that we're going to get back to normal seasonality after what's been a very tough housing market at the end of 2022? David Auld : I do think the credit markets have stabilized somewhat, consumer confidence improved a little bit. Job growth continues to be very good. So overall, if you look at product demand at just a generalized economy becoming less bad, very good signs for housing. And we monitor our sales; we monitor cancellations week to week to week to week. And so when we see that trend returning to more of a normalized market, it's hard not to be optimistic that we're going to good spring. And that's the way we're positioned and we'll get up every day and respond to what happens out there in the field. Jessica Hansen : Yeah, specific to Horton, those are other industry reasons, right? Specific to Horton, our inventory position puts us in a more confident place to be able to say we're going to see that pick up with the level of completed homes we have and the stage of construction, the homes behind those are at, because what we're seeing the most success in today is buyers who do want a home quickly because they can get that certainty of not only close date, but most importantly, interest rate. And so that is the majority of our buyers today, and that's why we feel very confident and are very happy with our inventory position right now. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand the call off to David Auld for some closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today, and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team. We're producing a solid first quarter while navigating changing market conditions, go compete and continue to win every day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are excited to announce that we recently closed our [1 millionth] home a first for any homebuilder. We are both humbled and proud to have been a part of a million families achieving their dream of home ownership over the past 45 years. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $2.73 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.2 billion on $8 billion in revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.6%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31 was 35.1%. And our consolidated return-on-equity for the same period was 27.2%. Spring selling season is off to an encouraging start with our net sales orders increasing 73% sequentially from the first quarter. Despite higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, demand improved during the quarter due to normal seasonal factors, coupled with our use of incentives and pricing adjustments to adapt to changing market conditions. Although higher interest rates and economic uncertainty may persist for some time, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points remains limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are well-positioned to navigate changing market conditions with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply and great trade and supplier relationships. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility. We will continue to focus on managing our product offerings, incentives, home prices, sales pace and inventory levels to meet the market, consolidate market-share, optimize returns and generate increased operating cash flow. Mike? Mike Murray : Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 32% to $2.73 per diluted share compared to $4.03 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 34% to $942 million on consolidated revenues of $8 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues were $7.4 billion, a 19,664 homes closed compared to $7.5 billion on 19,828 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,800, down 2% sequentially and essentially flat with the prior year quarter. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Our net sales orders in the second quarter decreased 5% to 23,142 homes and order value decreased 11% from the prior year to $8.6 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 16% in the prior year quarter, but down 27% sequentially. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3%, both sequentially and year-over-year. The average sales price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $372,900, down 7% from the prior year quarter and up 1% sequentially. To adjust the change in market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have continued offering incentives and reducing the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary to provide better affordability to homebuyers and to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. We expect to continue offering a similar level of incentives throughout 2023 and we are seeing indications that our average sales price and incentive levels are beginning to stabilize. Our sales volume in the third quarter and for the rest of the year will depend on the continued strength of the Spring selling season and general market conditions, which can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. We will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 21.6%, down 230 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from December to March reflects the impact of higher sales incentives and home price reductions. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1% sequentially. Stick and brick cost per square foot increased 1% and lot costs were up 5%. We are continuing to work with our trade partners and suppliers to reduce our construction costs on new home starts. We are making some limited progress in these efforts, but are also still experiencing some cost increases due to the overall inflationary environment. However, with the benefits of lower lumber costs, the average cost of our homes closed is beginning to stabilize, and we see indications that our home sales gross margin is also starting to stabilize around current levels. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the second quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 8% from last year, and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. We are controlling our SG&A while ensuring our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 19,900 homes this quarter and ended the quarter with 43,600 homes in inventory, down 27% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 24,800 of our homes at March 31 were unsold, of which 6,400 were completed. For homes we closed this quarter, our construction cycle time decreased 12 days from the first quarter reflecting our efforts to improve our cycle times and improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to evaluate demand and adjust our homes and inventory and start pace based on current market conditions. Mike? Mike Murray : Our homebuilding lot position at March 31 consisted of approximately 547,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 32% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. We are actively managing our investments in lots, land and development based on current market conditions. During the quarter, our homebuilding segment incurred $900,000 of inventory impairments and wrote off $13 million of option deposits and due diligence costs related to land and lot purchase contracts. We expect our level of option cost write-offs remain somewhat elevated in fiscal 2023 as we continue to manage our lot portfolio through changing market conditions. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $1.7 million, down 19% from the prior year quarter and flat sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $980 million for finished lots, $590 million for land development and $150 million for land acquisition. Bill? Bill Wheat : Financial services pretax income in the second quarter was $86 million on $216 million of revenues with a pretax profit margin of 39.6%. During the second quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 46% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. The First-time homebuyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our rental operations generated $224 million of revenues during the second quarter from the sale of 721 single-family rental homes, earning pretax income of $35 million. Our rental property inventory at March 31 was $3.3 billion, which included approximately $2.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our rental operations to generate significant increases in both revenues and profits in fiscal 2023 as our platform matures and expands across more markets. For the third quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be similar to our first and second quarters. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported total revenues of $302 million on 2,979 lots sold and pretax income of $36 million for the second quarter. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at March 31 was 76,400 lots. 54% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $220 million of our finished lots purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $650 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 25.2%. Forestar is well positioned to meet changing market conditions with its strong capitalization, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us the flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our cash provided by both our consolidated and homebuilding operations was $1.5 billion. At March 31, we had $4.4 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of $2.4 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. We repaid $300 million of 4.75% senior notes in February at maturity and we have $400 million of senior notes that will mature in August. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.5% at the end of March, and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 1.5%. Our consolidated leverage at March 31 was 22.4%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 12.3%. At March 31, our stockholders' equity was $20.7 billion, and book value per share was $60.73, up 27% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 27.2%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85.6 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in May. We repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $303 million during the quarter for a total of 4.5 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $421 million. Subsequent to quarter end, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our common stock, replacing our prior authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. We are providing detailed guidance for the third quarter as is our standard practice. We are also providing incremental guidance for the full year now that we have seen the beginning of the Spring selling season with good homebuyer demand and signs of stabilization in pricing, incentives and cost sense. We currently expect to generate consolidated revenues in our June quarter of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, and homes closed by our humbling operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 21,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 21% to 22% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter to be in the range of 7.2% to 7.5%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 24.5% in the third quarter. We are well positioned to continue aggregating market share in both our homebuilding and rental operations. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 77,000 and 80,000 homes in our homebuilding operations, and between 4,000 and 5,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in the range of $31.5 billion to $33 billion. We forecast an income tax rate for the year of approximately 24%. We expect to generate increased cash flow from our homebuilding operations and on a consolidated basis in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. We also plan to repurchase shares at a similar dollar amount as last year to reduce our share count with the volume of our repurchases dependent on cash flow, liquidity, market conditions and our investment opportunities. We have $400 million of senior notes that matured during the remainder of the year, which we are positioned to repay from cash. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to effectively operate in changing economic conditions and continue aggregating market share. We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. And a special thank you from Don Horton, our Founder and Executive Chairman, to the countless D.R. Horton employees and trade partners over the past 45 years. We participate in the countless D.R. Horton -- we participated in and contributed to our journey to build, sell and close 1 million homes. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from John Lovallo at UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, to the extent you can comment on April trends, I mean it sounds like from what we can gather from March checks in April has trended along pretty nicely. And along those same lines, if we think about the third quarter, typical absorption declining, call it, 10% sequentially. Is that a reasonable way as a starting point as we move into the third quarter here? Or how are you thinking about that? Jessica Hansen : Sure. We continue to be pleased with our sales pace in April. You heard us say stabilize a lot on the call, and we really feel like we've seen signs of that and everything has continued into April as we would like to see. In terms of what our Q3 sales look like versus our Q2 sales, typically, it can go either way. A lot of times, it's dead on within a few houses. So we could be slightly up. We could be slightly down. Sales-wise sequentially, it's going to be dependent though on the continued strength of the Spring, what happens with mortgage rates and anything else, obviously, economics that could drive that. But right now, it feels pretty good. John Lovallo : Makes sense. And then just given the demand is holding up reasonably well, do you think there could be somewhat of an industry, I don't want to say land grab, but more of a push towards companies going out and trying to buy more land as maybe expectations reset a bit more positively to you ahead looking into 2024? Mike Murray : I think you can look across the board and see that most builders have a pretty good lot portfolio out in front of them. I know we're over roughly 550,000 lots controlled that were owned. So we feel really good about the positioning we have for handling increased demand as well as if we needed -- if demand moderates, we've got flexibility in that portfolio. We will look to continue to add on to our portfolio where it makes sense on a deal-by-deal market-by-market basis. Haven't seen evidence of a big land grab yet. John Lovallo : Got it. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim at Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. I got to start off with a comment, which is that if you do the high end of your guide for closings this year, effectively, you'll have had pretty stable closings in '21, '22 and '23, which is a pretty remarkable achievement given the volatility in the adverse environment we saw late last year. So congrats to you guys on that. Now regarding the -- I wanted to talk about market share. One of the things that we've seen as -- I see as an emerging trend is that builders such as yourselves are going to be able to gain share, particularly from some of your private guys who are more dependent upon regional and local banks. So I wanted to ask you whether you think that a lot of the strength that you've been seeing recently is -- can be attributed to market share gains, and if so, does that mean that you can continue to see your volumes to rebound without seeing a commensurate rise in overall costs, which was a theme that people were wrestling with over the last few months? David Auld : Stephen, in markets where we have our largest market share controlled the largest market share. We see much more stability in both cost and demand and deliveries and margin. So it's our expectation as we continue to consolidate markets. There's going to be kind of a new norm and stability of margin and cost structure, to be honest with you. It allows -- as we get more efficient and more efficient in delivering houses, we can hit the affordability requirements and still maintain margin. So why we focus on it, it's not just about the number of houses, but controlling the percentage of the market that gives us more access to trades, materials and a stronger relationship with developers and third-party realtors, which all drive our business. Stephen Kim : Great. That's encouraging. Appreciate that. Second question relates to what degree you're able to ratchet back incentives looking ahead? I know you sort of talked about a stable environment, and I get that. But I also know that you are probably going to be adjusting what sort of product you put out to market. I would guess that probably has a little bit more of a value orientation. And I'm curious as to whether you anticipate over the medium term that you will be able to ratchet back your incentives as you roll out some more inherently affordable product by design? Paul Romanowski : Stephen, as we see stability in the market, it certainly allows us to pull back on incentives and where we have the opportunity, and we have some pricing power. We're taking advantage of that. We aren't seeing a significant change in what we offer in the market. We have some smaller homes that we've been able to put out and where it makes sense, we're taking advantage of that. So we do see an opportunity to continue to peel back on incentives and take advantage of pricing power on a go-forward basis. Jessica Hansen : And as with everything, we're not directing anything globally nationwide, community by community, market by market, our local operators are making those decisions to maximize returns at the local level. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Carl Reichardt at BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Last couple of quarters, there's been sort of a mixed bag in terms of geographic performance for builders with the Southeast Texas pretty good and the West weak. I'm curious in one quarter, and I know we're going to see some of this information when you guys put the stuff up on the site. But was there any sort of significant recovery in some of the markets that have been weaker, David, in the first quarter, especially in the West in terms of orders? David Auld : Carl, it's less, it's about positioning. We like the way we're positioned out there and then driving stability. So consistency, stability, flag count, I'm not sure that we saw significant improvement. But again, it's a part of the overall contributor, so. Jessica Hansen : Yes. Most of our pickup really was absorption versus community count. Our overall community count was only up 3% sequentially. We saw three of our regions up better than normal seasonality, but call it, still less than 60%. And then we have the Southeast, East and North that were much higher. The North is a lot of new communities, new markets, but the Southeast and the East are just showing the continued strength, particularly in Florida and the Carolinas. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thanks Jess. And then on supply chain, you mentioned -- or sorry, on the cycle times, you mentioned down 12 days. And I'm curious if that was just really all supply chain improvement or, to some extent, sort of mix and moving down to quicker homes to turn? And then are you expecting additional improvement in the back half of the year in that metric? Mike Murray : Yes. Carl, that was primarily supply chain improvements, finally getting houses through various stages of construction, being better organized and prepared with the labor. And we saw improvement sequentially throughout the quarter, and we're continuing to see improvement in early construction stage movements of homes more recently started. So yes, we expect to see better cycle times as we progress through the year. Carl Reichardt : I appreciate it all. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut at JPMorgan. Mike Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question, I wanted to get a sense. You mentioned that incentives have stabilized or recently stabilized. And based on our conversations with certain privates, there has been somewhat of an improvement in net pricing throughout the March quarter. I'm curious if you saw that as well? In other words, that net pricing by March end was better than the beginning of the year. And if so, all else equal, with that point, your 3Q gross margin towards the higher end of the range or even a little bit above, if you're expecting stabilization from here on in, particularly in this metric? Bill Wheat : Yes, Mike, I think the key word we keep using here is stabilization. We've started to see pricing and incentive levels stabilized during the quarter. Naturally, as that stabilization remains in place a bit longer, you are able to tighten things up a bit. And as we've been able to move through the Spring selling season. Community by community, we see strength, we see good turns. We're able to tighten those things up. So that's certainly overall an expectation, but it's community by community. So there are still places where we are seeing pricing still slightly decline, some places where we're seeing it stabilize, some places we're able to start pushing it up a little bit. So on a net basis, as we look forward, we expect our margins to stabilize around current levels. So that's why our guidance range anticipates perhaps slightly below this quarter, perhaps a little above this quarter. And it's too early to know for sure how that will play out over the remainder of the coming quarter. Mike Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that, Bill. I guess, secondly, maybe building on another question around ASP, how should we think about directionally ASPs, not just for the back half of this year, but into fiscal '24. Is it something where you feel like at current levels, there's been -- most of the adjustment has been made or I guess more specifically, I'm even thinking about potential product mix changes to continue to address affordability if you wouldn't want to try and drive ASP may be a little bit lower in fiscal '24, just to more fully address perhaps the market or affordability challenges, et cetera? Bill Wheat : Yes, Mike, I think that's just all part of the mix here, slightly reductions in the size of our homes trying to address the affordability equation. That's an ongoing effort for us. And that's why we leave a little room around current levels there because we were always going to try to be as affordable as we can. But at the same time, if we have a good market and we're able to take advantage of some pricing power, we will do that also community by community. So stabilization is the word for the day and obviously, we don't guide sales prices very far out. And it's largely going to be dependent ultimately on market conditions over the remainder of the year and what happens in the rate environment. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Matthew Bouley at Barclays. Matthew Bouley : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up on Steve's question from earlier around sort of what's happening with credit tightening from regional banks. And of course, the smaller private builders generally leveraging the regional banking system. Are you actually seeing any changes competitively yet from those smaller builders in terms of land acquisition starts? How are you guys sort of reacting to any changing conditions from those builders? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : We haven't really seen any significant shift in how they're operating in the market. A lot of builders certainly have come out of the end of this calendar year and had inventory that they may have gone through cancellations. They've been working through that product. Not seeing significant starts on a go-forward basis for most of the smaller privates or regional, and we certainly have picked up a few land positions, a lot of positions here and there, but no significant shift in how they're addressing the market. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And then secondly, it looks like you started less homes than you sold during the quarter. I think you guys have previously spoken about sort of aligning starts and sales pace. How are you guys thinking about that going forward? Is there any room to kind of push a little harder on starts here going forward given some of these improving demand trends? Jessica Hansen : Yes. We were in a transition in the last couple of quarters, it was more closely to sales. But really, our focus is tied closings in our search space. And if you look at that, we were kind of neck and neck this quarter. And so with our guide for next quarter and what we're trying to do market by market, community by community to build back our production capabilities, we would expect our starts to increase. The extent to which will be dependent on a lot of different factors, but we do expect our starts to increase next quarter. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thanks Jessica. Thanks everyone. Good luck. Jessica Hansen : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson at Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First, hoping to get an update on your mortgage business and the overall environment. Are you seeing any distress in the market from mid-tier banks, tightening of mortgage warehouse financing or tightening in consumer credit or lending standards for agency, non-agency loans? We've heard that it's been kind of business as usual, but I wanted to get your thoughts. Bill Wheat : Yes, obviously, with all the headlines that we've had this quarter, we have been watching that market very closely, having a lot of conversation with our banking relationships, but I would echo what you heard. At the moment, it's still business as usual. But obviously, that's something we'll continue to monitor. We just renewed our mortgage warehouse facility this quarter, and we kept basically the same bank group in place. And so that -- that market is still functioning and working as normal. But obviously, if we see further distress in that market, that's something we'll need to be prepared to adjust to. Truman Patterson : Bill, that relates to both D.R. Horton and kind of the broader market, those comments? Bill Wheat : Yes, absolutely. We all see the same headlines there. And depending on what happens in the rate environment and across the spectrum of banks, so there could be further headlines, obviously. But today, no, we have not seen a significant impact. Truman Patterson : Okay. Perfect. And then just an update on construction costs outside of lumber. It seems like they've been relatively sticky. And Bill, I think you even mentioned some costs might be increasing a little bit. But could you just give us an update on how you're viewing the magnitude of potential cost savings moving through the year really into 2024? Should we really see improvement outside of lumber? Or are things just pretty stable at this point? Mike Murray : I think we're seeing a lot of stability. A lot of the increases that we were taking over the past year have stopped. But we're seeing the effects of those increases coming through more recent starts would be at the more stable cost benefiting from the lumber commodity price declines. But we're getting to the point we're starting to anniversary well into some normalized lumber market pricing. So I'm not expecting to see huge changes in our cost inputs, but they certainly have been -- increases have been a little bit sticky. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you, all. And good luck on the upcoming quarter. Mike Murray : Thanks Truman. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari at Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Your net order ASP was up, I think, 1% quarter-over-quarter, which is a little bit better than we were expecting. Just wondering if there's any kind of mix effects that you'd call out there, whether regionally or product type kind of given the commentary around incentive stabilizing? Mike Murray : I think it's pretty much like-for-like. We saw a stabilizing market through the quarter. And in fact, about half of the homes we delivered this quarter were sold in the quarter. And so we feel pretty good about market conditions right now. We've seen good stabilization in pricing and incentive levels and when we see that, we're hitting absorptions in the communities at a community-by-community level, we're looking to adjust incentive levels and pricing. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the full year outlook, does that assume kind of mortgage rates around current levels? And if rates were to moderate a bit, do you have maybe some room to flex up production? Or should we think about that 80,000 to sort of an upper limit of where you could go for the year? Bill Wheat : I think the range we provided for the year is a realistic range given current conditions and our homes that we currently have an inventory and in production, as we've already stated, we do expect to incrementally increase our starts in the coming quarters. We saw a nice step-up in our starts this quarter and would expect that to incrementally improve from here. But in terms of significant upside to the delivery this year, I think we would say that our current range is a realistic one under all circumstances. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. And the mortgage rate assumptions around the full year guidance or just kind of around where we are or anything you'd call out there? Bill Wheat : Yes, current conditions. We guide based on current conditions. If things change, that obviously could affect our outlook. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Susan Maklari at Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning. My first question is, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the rental side of the business? As we've seen the for sale side, get a little better in the quarter. Are you seeing any shift there? And how are you thinking about the outlook the rentals? Paul Romanowski : We have seen good pace on our ability to rent up both our apartments and single-family for rent. We have seen stability in rent rates. They've been increasing quite a bit over the prior 12 months, and we've seen stability there. On the purchase side, we still see activity in the market. We have certainly some units that we pushed out and sold consistent this quarter really would last in terms of number of units. And although we have seen the number of buyers back off some and a little bit of tightening in credit in terms of their ability to get to these financed, but we still see pretty solid demand for the communities that we have out to market. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then given the outlook and the trajectory demand the way it seems to be coming together. Can you talk a bit about your appetite for land acquisitions? Land spend, I believe you said was about flat sequentially. How are you thinking about that as we go through the next couple of quarters? Bill Wheat : We're really just continuing to look at replenishing the supply market by market. We've got a good lot position, a good flexible lot position. So we'll continue to incrementally to just replenish it. I don't necessarily expect significant moves 1 way or the other. But as our volume of sales and closings increase, then we'll be -- to be replenishing a little bit more to match that. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you, and good luck. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Two things. First of all, I think the gross margin in the quarter was a bit better than you had targeted. What was different that drove the relative better gross margin performance? Bill Wheat : I think the main difference was our pricing stabilized at a slightly higher level than we were projecting. We were not seeing signs of stabilization at the end of the Q1. But once we've gotten into the spring, we've been able to see that really start to stabilize. So I think that -- I think we're seeing that stabilization a little sooner or a little earlier than we would have projected a quarter ago. Mike Murray : We definitely saw a strong start to the spring selling season in the March quarter. And as I mentioned before, half the homes we closed were sold in the quarter. So they benefited from some of the stabilizing and improving price environment. We carried a fair number of completed specs in the quarter. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, in regards to incentives or pricing. I'm curious if you can help with the what the average rate on closings is? I'm just trying to get a sense of where rate buy downs are part of the effort, the magnitude of what that looks like, what the -- I guess, in other words, what the magic number of rates or the bull side that you need to get rates to get consumers comfortable closing on homes? Jessica Hansen : Yes. So our average general buy down is typically a point on the loan value. So I would say there's been a lot of headlines out there talking about 5.5%. It fluctuates probably a little bit, but 5.5% is relatively reasonable in terms of what a consumer is okay with at this point. Bill Wheat : Roughly 60%, 65% of our buyers are utilizing that buy down through our mortgage company. And so they're getting that benefit of that point buy down. Eric Bosshard : And then regarding the trend within that, has there been any change within that? Or is that kind of the bulls out that works? And obviously, the mortgage market moves around, but is that 5.5% the 60 to 65 , has there been any variability in the trend around either of those? Paul Romanowski : It's been pretty consistent certainly throughout the quarter, and rates have stayed relatively consistent. And we will fluctuate our rate to the market based on what we see in the overall market rates. So for the last quarter, it's hovered right around that 5.5% and seems to be accepted by our homebuyers. Eric Bosshard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner at Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. First question, obviously, you guys are an entry-level builder, but you do have exposure at different price points in segments as well. So I'm curious if you're seeing any notable differences in terms of demand trends across your price points? And similar to that effect, we have heard in recent quarters that -- and I think you guys mentioned this as well that there was a reluctance of buyers to kind of sit in backlog for a long period of time given the volatility in rates and you guys were holding specs off until they were further along in the construction process. Has that changed at all? Are you seeing -- with the stability now are you seeing more willingness to maybe sit in backlog for a longer period of time? Mike Murray : I think we are seeing some buyers willing to buy earlier in the production process. There's been a little bit of stability in market rates, and they feel good about that. But the better thing for us is we're seeing our cycle times improve. So we're still able to give them sort of a shorter period of time in backlog than they would have had six months or certainly a year ago. And so there's a confidence level that we're able to sell from that helps that buyer quite a bit. Alan Ratner : Got it. And on the price point question, any notable differences that move up and active adult recognizing it's a smaller part of your business? Paul Romanowski : No, Alan. We really haven't seen market to market a significant difference in terms of levels of demand as we go up and down the price curve, even where we are at the higher end of the price market in any given market, we're still at the value price point for that price. So we're still seeing that demand. And for us, if they've come off of a $700,000 price, that means they may be looking for 6 or 5. And so we are catching those people, I think, as they move down the curve. Jessica Hansen : And what still hasn't changed is the amount of existing home inventory out there and available. That remains very limited. And so if somebody does want to home at a higher price point or a lower price point, new construction is where they can find it right now. David Auld : And you also have the trend of migration from high cost state to lower cost states, what seems like a high price point in Florida where our Florida operators is a relatively low price for somebody coming from New York or California. Alan Ratner : Understood. If I can squeeze in a follow-up on the rental segment. If I look at the average order price of your SFR homes, it's come down quite significantly. And I'm sure there might be some mix involved there since we're talking about a relatively small number of homes. But is that 25%, 30% decline in per unit price. I think this quarter's average was in the low 300s. Is that representative of what's going on in the market today? Or have the trends mirrored the for-sale market? Mike Murray : I think we've seen certainly through the fall with the disruption in the capital markets, increases in cap rates for disposition of those properties. But largely what we saw this quarter was a change in mix of geographies of where those homes were being delivered and related rental rates and NOIs on those projects. So still feel good about the overall platform for sure. Very excited about the opportunities that are in front of us with that and excited that the capital markets have been stabilizing a little bit, which is going to help execution for sure, on the disposition of those properties. Paul Romanowski : And also expect, on a go-forward basis, to see a little more variability in our rental platform just because we're selling whole communities at a time, and they could be townhomes or smaller homes or geographic location can cause that to move around a little more than our for-sale business. Bill Wheat : Until the volume and the number of projects closing in the quarter gets up to larger level in a steady state, you're going to see a little bit more lumpiness in the quarter-to-quarter stats there. David Auld : And I will say it's very difficult to put a lot on the ground had to get a house build, very little inventory out there and a lot of money chasing investment properties. So we think we have high hopes for this product segment. Alan Ratner : Appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask, how do you think about how your ability to offer rate buy downs impacts demand and sort of a volatile mortgage rate environment? Do you see volatility in weekly traffic and demand as mortgage rates move around? Or is your ability to offer rate buy down to prevent that? Paul Romanowski : I think you could certainly see, as rates shift in traffic, you're going to see that change either up or down. But the sales cycle time isn't immediate. And so our agents and our realtor partners do a good job of maintaining those buyer relationships and our ability to offer some stability in and that rate helps us really at the close. David Auld : And just certainty of payment gives the confidence to the buyer and at a 5.5% rate, we have more qualified buyers than we do at a 6.5% rate. So it opens up ownership to more people if you're able to present that. Jessica Hansen : Much easier to manage to the interest rate environment when now you're talking about 20 to 50 basis point moves in rates versus what we were experiencing in the back half of last year. I mean it's just not as impactful as what we had to manage through last year. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. And then just following up on an earlier question on how the gross margin came in versus your initial guidance for the quarter. It sounded like the pricing stability was higher than projected. Is it -- did you start to raise prices at all during the quarter and then the gross margin improved throughout the quarter? Or was there a better elasticity where you didn't have to lower prices as much as you anticipated to sell homes that had the current rate? Bill Wheat : Versus the guidance we gave, it was the latter. We did not have to lower as much as we had been projecting necessarily. But in terms of how we're actually managing community by community that's a mix bag as we got into the spring, and we did, as Mike said, we sold about half our homes that we closed this quarter in the quarter. So as we started hitting our pace, seeing solid demand into the spring, definitely in certain communities, we are starting to push pricing up, carefully, but are pushing it up. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question is coming from Buck Horne at Raymond James. Buck Horne : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Before we leave the rental segment altogether, I wanted to just maybe drill down a little bit further in terms of breaking apart your expectations for single-family rental versus multifamily for the remainder of the year. You mentioned that there's been some backing up of cap rate expectations, I guess, with higher cost of capital and disruptions in the capital markets. Is that more pronounced on multifamily versus SFR or vice versa? Or kind of -- what are you seeing in terms of buyer expectations for stabilized cap rates in either segment? Mike Murray : What are we -- other than saying higher than they were a year ago. On a go-forward basis, it does seem to have stabilized. I don't think it has been changing between the multifamily and the single-family rental. The relative gap that's there has not changed. Generally, the multifamily projects underwrite at a slightly lower cap rate. Like-for-like, it's a more established market. It's a more known market, but still very pleased with the performance we're getting from that segment and the disposition opportunities ahead of us over the next several quarters. Buck Horne : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And maybe just kind of hypothetically just thinking ahead here with challenges in the regional banking environment and maybe more capital constraints for -- particularly for smaller and your regional private competition -- homebuilding competition that is, would you think that it's possible that more M&A opportunities might open up either later this year or in the next year if there's just more capital constraints on some of your small private competition out there? David Auld : Well, we do believe that the capital constraints for the privates and smaller builders is going to be impactful in -- we see opportunities. We evaluate the opportunities and based upon positioning people in market that they have, we'll pursue them or not. But here regardless, it's going to help us aggregate markets, whether it's via acquisition or picking up a lots or just providing more inventory availability than can be done by a private or a small region. So It's an opportunity for us. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Alex Barron at Housing Research Center. Alex Barron : Yes. Thank you. I was hoping we could think a big talk -- big picture. At the end of 2020, there was a lot of demand and everybody just took a lot of orders and then suddenly ran into supply chain issues in the following year, as demand is pretty good here at 6%, 6.5% rates. If rates were to go down, say, below 6% or towards 5% in the next year or something, what do you guys think you could do differently this time around to be able to capture and deliver on those homes? Meaning have you guys thought of doing warehousing of materials or hiring crews to some level of the deliveries or some type of vertical integration? Any thoughts around anything you do different to be able to grow and not just kind of keep your deliveries limited? David Auld : I think there is just a built-in capacity issue in the industry. And even when you think you've got everything solved, then something else happens. I mean the transformers that bring some innovations for life could be a huge issue and getting lots delivered within the next 12 to 15 months. And so you're constantly looking at how are you positioned, where can we pick up incremental capacity, both in trade and in lines, and from a division level push, that is really kind of what we've been focused on, simplifying our operations, consolidating markets, consolidating trade capacity. And how do we improve our logistics of getting materials to communities. But it's just within the entire industry, if we had 100% of the trade material capacity, it would still be constructed. It's very difficult for lots on the ground, very difficult to get house built. And I do think that's why we're gaining market share because we are 100% focused on controlling capacity throughout the supply chain. Alex Barron : Okay. And in terms of the land supply, I mean, you guys have shifted materially in the last few years. What percentage of your lots you own versus how many you option? And you obviously acquired Forestar to kind of help in that process but is there anything else that you could do to I guess, grow Forestar or do something to shift your ability to increase that ratio of going to option even more? David Auld : Well, let's just continue to work. I mean it's day-in, day-out, developing great -- our development partners and then building a trust relationship with them where they know when we bring up a deal or they bring us a deal that there's going to be the highest level of execution from a housing standpoint of anybody in the industry. And it is hard work. It's to build relationships over time and maintain trust through any kind of market. So -- but we're just going to continue to work on it. Try to get a little better next year. That's -- there's no magic wand to make all that happen. It's hard work. It's trust, it's transparency. It's building relationships. Alex Barron : All right. Well, best of luck on your road back to 100,000. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Mike Dahl at RBC Capital Markets. MikeDahl: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up on the lot side. A couple of comments already on the call, but you note the flexibility in your current portfolio, not necessarily getting too aggressive on offense. Yes, I'm still expecting somewhat elevated option write-offs. I guess I'm wondering, clearly, as the markets improved, probably some deals that you have in your existing book maybe you didn't think they would pencil a quarter or two ago and now they might be. Any way that you could kind of ballpark quantify what deals you think have kind of come back into the underwriting box on what makes sense today versus things you might have thought you would walk from prior? Mike Murray : We have so many deals under contract and evaluation at any point in time. It would be really hard for us to have any sense of what fell out or was falling out and leading our global operations teams to think this deal doesn't work anymore, and now it might. I can tell you, as David said, anytime we have an opportunity to get finished lots that are increasingly difficult to get produced these days, we are aggressively looking for ways to work with our development partners, landowners to make the deals work and to find ways to bring those lots to market. So it's a constant evaluation process and the transparency and the relationships we've built over 45 years of doing this really help us achieve that. MikeDahl: Got it. Okay. And then second question, just on capital allocation. With the buyback based on dollar figure in terms of the guide, obviously, you're moving the stock that doesn't necessarily buy as much as it would have a quarter or two ago. So when we're thinking about incremental capital allocation and the balance sheet and the cash flow expectations, I guess what's -- do you think you'll keep targeting more of that dollar figure? Or should we expect as the year goes on, that you move back to more targeting a certain level of either dilution offset or net share count reduction? Bill Wheat : Yes. It's always -- obviously, we're looking at both the dollars invested as well as the impact on the share count, and you will never hear me complain about a higher stock price for sure and with respect to our repurchase activity. So -- but end of the day, it's dollars that we're investing. And so we look at our cash flow, we look at our earnings, we look at our liquidity levels, we look at our projections going forward to the extent that our projections are improving and our cash flow prospects are improving versus what we had previously thought then that increases the chance of increasing share repurchase levels. But as of right now, and as we're looking at the rest of the year and our positioning there and our needs for our capital to invest in the business, guiding to around the same level of dollar investment as last year is still where we expect to be, but that's something we'll be constantly reevaluating. MikeDahl: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jay McCanless at Wedbush. Jay McCanless : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So if my math is right, I think this is the fifth quarter in a row where average selling communities have been up year-over-year. I guess, and I think you talked a little bit about this earlier, David, what are the headwinds remaining to continuing that kind of growth streak? And I'm presuming that the lot count you have right now could support further growth, but maybe just talk about that trajectory? David Auld : It's going to be market to market, I can tell you. Kind of what Mike said earlier, where we have an opportunity to pick up finished lots on some kind of role or take. We're going to pursue that aggressively. It's consolidating, it's like controlling the lumber yard. If you control the lots, you control the capacity, the ability to meet capacity. So I would anticipate the committed count continue to decline. When it was declining because every time we open community, it sold out immediately, which is a good thing. But the market is normalizing. There's much more stability from the -- are much better ability to kind of look at the market, understand the absorption, set a start pace and kind of drive an efficient production operation. So I guess, loans -- that's a long way to say, yes, I do think you're going to see our community count continue to move on. Jay McCanless : Okay. Great. It is a high-class problem to have. And I guess the question I have, pre-COVID, could you remind us for the fiscal second and fiscal third quarter historically, what was the percentage of homes that you would sell and close intra-quarter? Jessica Hansen : That really bounces around quite a bit, and it doesn't really have a whole lot of seasonality. It's just kind of dependent on our inventory position at the time, which is why we were able to sell and close 50% of our homes this quarter, intra-quarter sold and closed at the same quarter, which is very high. A more normalized range would be somewhere between 30% and 40%. So when we think about Q3, it could still be elevated, but we don't necessarily expect to replicate the 50%. David Auld : Well, our backlog going into this quarter is much better than - much better position. So. Jessica Hansen : Yes. Jay McCanless : Okay. Great. Appreciate it. Thank you. David Auld : Again, things just feel to be normalizing. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to David Auld for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton team in producing a solid second quarter. Continue to compete and continue to win every day. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Vice President of Investor Relations for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our President and CEO. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray and Paul Romanowski, our Executive Vice Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.90 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.8 billion on an 11% increase in revenues to $9.7 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.3%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30 was 31.8%, and our return on equity for the same period was 24.3%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 37% from the prior-year quarter, as the supply of both new home and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency each of -- in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to release homes for sale earlier in the construction cycle. We are pleased that we were able to increase our homebuilding starts to 22,900 homes this quarter, which was supported by a 6% sequential increase in our active selling communities. Our homebuilding operating margins are lower than the record high margins we reported last year due to cost inflation and pricing adjustments and incentives we implemented to address homebuyer affordability challenges caused by higher mortgage rates. However, our margins improved sequentially from the March to June quarter as home prices and incentives have stabilized and some reductions in construction costs are now being realized in our homes closed. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, diverse product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity position to produce and sustain consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of our company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 16% to $3.90 per diluted share, compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter decreased 19% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues were $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed, compared to $8.3 billion on 21,308 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $378,600, flat sequentially and down 3% from the prior-year quarter. Mike? Mike Murray : Our net sales orders in the third quarter increased 37% to 22,879 homes, and order value increased 26% from the prior year to $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, flat sequentially and down from 24% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 6% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $381,100, up 2% sequentially and down 8% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates over the past year, we increased our use of incentives and reduced the sizes of our homes to provide better affordability to homebuyers. Although home prices and incentives have begun to stabilize, we expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives as compared to last year. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 23.3%, up 170 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from March to June reflects a decrease in incentive costs and lower stick-and-brick costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and lot costs were both flat sequentially, while stick-and-brick cost per square foot decreased 4%. As Mike mentioned, we continue to -- we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives as compared to 2022. But due to the recent stabilization in home prices and some reductions in both incentives and construction costs, we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the third quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.7%, up 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 7.2% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year as we've maintained the capacity of our platform to grow market share. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 22,900 homes in the June quarter, up 15% from the March quarter. We ended the quarter with 43,800 homes in inventory, down 22% from a year ago and flat sequentially. 25,000 of our homes at June 30 were unsold, of which 5,700 were completed. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by over a month from the second quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We expect to see a further decrease in our cycle time for homes closed in the fourth quarter. We will continue to [ingest] (ph) our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike? Mike Murray : Our homebuilding lot position at June 30 consisted of approximately 555,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 34% of our total owned lots are finished and 53% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital-efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior-year quarter and 27% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.2 billion for finished lots, $700 million for land development, and $290 million for land acquisition. Paul? Paul Romanowski : During the quarter, our rental operations generated $162 million of pre-tax income on $667 million of revenues from the sale of 1,754 single-family rental homes and 230 multi-family rental units. Our rental property inventory at June 30 was $3.3 billion, which consisted of $1.9 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multi-family rental properties. Our rental operations are generating significant increases in both revenues and profits this year, as our platform expands across more markets. For the fourth quarter, we expect our rental revenues to be greater than our third quarter and our rental profit margin to be lower than our third quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported total revenues of $369 million for the third quarter on 3,812 lots sold with pre-tax income of $62 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at June 30 was 73,000 lots. 57% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the third quarter were from Forestar. Forestar is separately capitalized from D.R. Horton and had more than $780 million of liquidity at quarter-end, with a net debt to capital ratio of 19.1%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike? Mike Murray : Financial services earned $94 million of pre-tax income in the third quarter on $229 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 41.2%. During the quarter, 99% of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 74% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 723 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time homebuyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $2.1 billion and our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion. At June 30, we had $4.6 billion of homebuilding liquidity, consisting of $2.6 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and $2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility. Homebuilding debt at June 30 totaled $2.7 billion, which includes $400 million of senior notes that we redeemed early in July. Our homebuilding leverage was 11.1% at the end of June and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 0.7%. Our consolidated leverage at June 30 was 22%, and consolidated leverage net of cash was 11.2%. At June 30, our stockholders' equity was $21.7 billion, and book value per share was $64.03, up 23% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June, our return on equity was 24.3%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $85 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in August. We repurchased 3.1 million shares of common stock for $343 million during the quarter for a total of 7.7 million shares repurchased fiscal year-to-date for $764 million. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward, we expect current market conditions to continue with uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business. For the full year, we currently expect to close between 82,800 and 83,300 homes in our homebuilding operations and between 6,500 and 7,000 homes and units in our rental operations. We expect our consolidated revenues for fiscal 2023 to be in a range of $34.7 billion to $35.1 billion. We expect to generate greater than $3 billion of cash flow from operations in fiscal 2023, primarily from our homebuilding operations. We also expect our fiscal 2023 share repurchases to be approximately $1.1 billion, similar to last year. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.7 billion to $10.1 billion, and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 22,800 to 23,300 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be approximately 23.5% to 24%, and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 6.7% to 6.8%. We anticipate our financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35%, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% in the fourth quarter. We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares. David? David Auld : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform to sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. Impressive quarter once again. So, congratulations on that. I wanted to talk about your construction -- your pace of construction and your goals going forward. You talked about growing your starts this quarter versus last quarter. But when we just look back maybe a year, year and a half ago, there were a couple of quarters where you started even more. You started about 25,000 units a quarter. I wanted to get a sense from you as to whether or not you feel like that's a level that you could achieve in the near term, and if not why not? And then also if you could talk about whether seasonality is going to be a factor we should be thinking about with respect to your starts cadence? Paul Romanowski : Yes, Stephen, we have seen, as we talked, about a 30-day reduction in our cycle time and see consistency and improvement as we travel throughout our divisions and seen pretty good balance with our trades and all the supplies that we need to continue with improvement in cycle time. If you look at our starts pace, it did tick up some and stayed pretty consistent with our closings, which is a cadence that we expect to see as we look towards the fourth quarter. Based on our sales pace and the strength of the market, and where we have the lots and the ability to push that up a little bit, we will, but not looking to outpace the market and continue to keep in that cadence and position ourselves for continued growth. Stephen Kim : Okay. So, it sounds like I didn't really get a sense for whether 25,000 is a significant figure in your mind. And why is that a level that we couldn't achieve or revisit? Simply because it wasn't that long ago where you actually did that for, like I said, two quarters in a row. And then also if I could tack on a second question about your rental platform. You did give some guidance regarding [revs] (ph) being higher, but margins being lower relative to -- in 4Q relative to 3Q. Could you talk about your plans for rental inventory in dollars carried on the balance sheet? Where should we be thinking you're going to take that level of investment, which I think is $3.3 billion, if I'm not mistaken, right now? Is that going to grow meaningfully as we look into 2024 and beyond, or is that a level that you feel comfortable with, maybe even begin to harvest some of that? Thanks. David Auld : Hey, Steve, as to the 25,000 starts per quarter, we are very focused on increasing -- incrementally increasing starts quarter to quarter to quarter. And we believe that as we continue this process, we will consolidate the labor availability capacity. And with labor and material consolidation, our ability to program out our starts and then continue to build the houses and gain efficiency in that process, it's just an ongoing effort. So, do we have a target out there of we've got to get to this number? No. Our target is market by market, flag by flag, how do we consolidate these markets and increase our market share. And just by the nature of doing that, we're going to get bigger and bigger and bigger. And I'll let Mike reply to the rental question. Mike Murray : Hey, Stephen. So, we expect that the margin on the fourth quarter closings in the rental segment will probably have a lower profit margin, largely on the basis of a mix of projects that are delivering between Q3 and then into Q4. A lot of it's on a cost basis difference between those homes that were built at different times and when they're delivering. Paul Romanowski : And then, in terms of our forward investment level, we're at a total of about $3.3 billion of inventory today. We've seen a significant growth ramp in that over the last two years. We do expect to continue to grow that platform and we will see our inventory levels continue to grow over the next couple of years, but we do expect that growth pace to moderate from what it's been in the last two years. Stephen Kim : Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank. Joe, your line is live. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Thanks, and good quarter, guys. David Auld : Thank you. Joe Ahlersmeyer : I wanted to follow up on the community count. That's up about 9% year-to-date, calendar year-to-date that is. And I'm just wondering is there anything in there that we should consider that's more temporary in nature? I'm not going to straight-line that release or anything that sequential number, but should we expect that to go down into the back half, or are we going to sustain those levels? And then I have a follow-up. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Joe. We've been really focused on our flag count. I mean, we clearly have the lot position to open new communities and to grow our community count, whereas the last couple of years, it's not moved more than a low-single digit percentage. We do feel like we're positioned to be closer to the mid-single digits going forward. So not necessarily 9% going forward, but around the mid-single digits quarter-to-quarter. There can be some choppiness just determining when we close out of communities and ultimately bring them online, but our lot position is there and our operators are focused on growing their flag count. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Makes sense. And just thinking about the homes and inventory number, that was actually sequentially flattish the last couple quarters, even as you did grow those communities. So, is it right to think that maybe this is part of returning to higher levels of inventory unit turnover? Or should we expect that the total homes and inventory will sort of catch up on a lag as you continue to grow starts? Paul Romanowski : We're very focused on improving our inventory turn and as our construction cycle times have improved, that's facilitating that. You look historically, we typically when we go into a year with our number of homes in inventory, we've been able to turn that 2 times in the following year. The last couple of years has been slower than that, and so we're looking to get back to that more historic inventory turn level as we look to fiscal '24. David Auld : That is a -- going back to the start question, that is a factor in our start pace is making sure that we have the capacity to continue to deliver these houses in a more -- in a faster and more efficient way. It all flows together so that we can actually deliver more houses with fewer homes and inventory quarter-to-quarter, quarter-to-quarter. Joe Ahlersmeyer : That's great to hear. Thanks very much, and good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is, it looks like the sequential improvement or the sequential cadence of orders from the second quarter to third quarter was better than normal seasonality by a bit. I mean, I think normal seasonality would suggest down about 5%. It looks like they were down about 1%. As we move into the fourth quarter, how should we sort of think about seasonality, which looks like it's typically down, call it, 15% to 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis? Is that a reasonable way to think about the fourth quarter, or are the dynamics getting a little bit better out there where you might be able to do a bit better than that? Paul Romanowski : Yeah. Thanks, John. I think we are seeing more normal seasonality this year in terms of just demand traffic patterns. And so, I think our base expectations would be that orders would show a bit closer to normal seasonality going forward. But to our approach in trying to be as consistent as we can and providing starts pace and a consistent level of inventory, we're still a short supply of inventory out there in the existing home market and in the new home market. We're going to make sure we've got enough homes out there to capture whatever demand there may be. And so, our hope would be, over the longer term, we could see a bit more consistency there. But there still is a natural seasonality and an ebb-and-flow to consumer demand that I think is getting back to a more normal level. David Auld : And I do believe that we're going to have a lot more houses to sell this year, given the shortened cycle time and our ability to give people a date certain to close. So, we were limited in the number homes last year. So, the comparison this quarter to last quarter, a year-ago quarter, is probably going to -- it's going to look better than typical seasonality. John Lovallo : That makes sense. Okay. And then maybe just a bigger picture question. If we look at 2019, D.R. Horton delivered 57,000 homes, in that ballpark, versus the -- close to 83,000 homes expected this year. Industry-wide single-family starts were pretty similar in 2019 to what's expected today. Obviously, Horton and the publics have been gaining share for years, but this is close to a 45%, 50% jump since 2019. So, I guess, the question is, how sustainable are these gains? How important is your build strategy to this performance? And maybe how important is the lack of existing home inventory just to overall homebuilder success today? David Auld : I think, yes, yes, and yes. We've been focused for years now on simplifying this business and creating a level of consistency that didn't exist in the '80s, '90s, or early 2000s. And jokingly I call it building a real business, and I believe we have and are doing that. And coming out of the downturn, there was tremendous opportunity to consolidate market. But we didn't have the liquidity or balance sheet to do it. So, as we have grown through this last 15 years, 20 years -- 15 years, I guess, our goal has been to create a company with a balance sheet and the liquidity to take advantage of any disruptions in the market. And since 2019, it just seems like, at least quarterly, you either coming out of it or going into it another disruption. So, it's the power of the platform and we talk a lot about it. I think you're seeing it play out. It's people, it's location, product, it's just trying to simplify the business and create affordability to a level nobody else can achieve. And that's going to consolidate these markets. John Lovallo : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Bill, you mentioned stick and brick down 4% per foot, I think, year-on-year. Could you break that out in terms of what materials are helping most, obviously, lumber and then labor? And the reason I ask is, I'm assuming that we're starting to see some leverage from the single-family and multi-family rental platform. Part of the reason you're trying to grow that business is to add scale in your markets to lower overall construction costs. So, I'm wondering if that's starting to help there. Bill Wheat : Right now, as we look at the components of the home across the materials, it is primarily lumber right now. There are some minor moves in both directions, really across the other components of the homes. It's primarily lumber there. I think we are on the front edge of starting to realize some improvement in labor as the homes that we have been starting over the last quarter or two have been at a lower cost than what we had there for a while. But I think we still expect a bit more improvement there with lumber. And then really, the forward cost structure really depends on what the capacity of the industry is and what all builders are doing. So, a bit more improvement there, but as we continue to add scale, which does include our rental platform as well, we definitely have advantages and opportunities to continue to leverage that to drive our cost structure down, especially relative to the rest of the industry. Carl Reichardt : Okay. Thank you, Bill. And then David, the private builders we're talking to, we've seen sort of -- you mentioned normal seasonality to a slower market maybe than they had expected starting the summer. I don't know if that's just the particular vagaries of being small and private. They can't -- harder to buydowns, more capital constraints to do higher-end. But you purchased a private during the quarter and you've got presence in a lot of markets where the smaller privates really make up the bulk of your competitors, in some cases, all of them. Has there been much movement in terms of interest willingness or need to sell among the privates right now, just given what they're facing relative to what the publics have advantage-wise? Thanks. David Auld : Carl, we talk about it a lot, seems like in the last couple of years, but it is really hard to put a lot on the ground. It is really hard to build houses. And these private guys, now, they've got to struggle with capital from either private or banks increasing in cost. So, do we have the opportunity to talk to a lot of these guys? Yes, we do. But it's going to take unique opportunities for us to invite them into the family, because we do have a special culture here and we're not going to screw it up trying to force a square peg in a round hole. Jessica Hansen : Excited about the most recent [indiscernible] Truland in terms of already having been one of our largest lot developers in our Gulf Coast region. And so, we picked up Truland's homebuilding operations, but Nathan Cox and his team will continue to be a key component in terms of developing lots to us and for us in the Gulf Coast. David Auld : And I will say, I've had a personal relationship with Nathan Cox for 15 plus years, and he is an example of somebody that absolutely mirrors our culture. He's a super quality guy. He's built a good company, and somebody who we're going to be in business with for a long, long time. Carl Reichardt : Great. I appreciate it. Thanks all. David Auld : Thank you, Carl. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. I wanted to circle back to an earlier answer that you gave around -- thoughts around your 4Q demand and order trends. Last month, you had Lennar talk about their third quarter orders being a little bit above 2Q and KB talking about normal seasonality being muted in the third -- in their third quarter, all based on not only strong demand but also kind of filling a void for the lack of supply that's out there and the strong demand that new homebuilders can provide as a result. So, just going back to your comments, I think, Bill, you kind of said, perhaps normal seasonality. David, I think I heard you say perhaps better than normal seasonality. I was hoping to kind of get a finer-tuned answer there in terms of what you think your capacity is to meet demand. Again, is there an ability to take orders that is similar to the third quarter level if you see the demand there? And I would assume you'd be just as interested in taking as much share as you can. Or going back to an earlier question as well, is there any type of production constraints that might hold you back there a little bit? Jessica Hansen : Sure, Mike. So, I mean, we're not in this for quarterly results. We're in this for the long term and to build as much shareholder value as we can over the long term. So, quarter to quarter to quarter, as you've heard David say over and over, we're focused on being consistent, and, as we've talked about, it's all tied to our starts pace. So, we're not managing to a sales number in Q4. If the market's there and our cycle times continue to improve, we might be able to see a little bit better than normal seasonality. If the market were to weaken for some reason or we don't get as many homes started ultimately, it could be less than normal seasonality. Right now, we feel like we're positioned to increase our starts slightly from where we were in Q3. And also, as we've talked about, our construction cycle times have continued to improve and our flag count has grown. So, we feel like we're very well-positioned. But frankly, we're more focused on positioning for '24 at this point than we are worried about Q4. I mean, we're going to finish out the year very strong and generate strong returns and continue to add to book value and position ourselves to go do the same in 2024. Mike Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that. I guess, maybe then turning to '24, when you look at your backlog conversion at the beginning of the year relative to what you deliver, at best, you kind of hit a 4 times -- maybe low 4 times turnover. In other words, your backlog turned over 4 times in terms of the amount of closings you were able to achieve. The height was in 2020 at 4.8 times. It looks like, on a rough basis, you'd probably be closer to 5 times or above, maybe even 6 times, given where potentially your backlog could be at the end of this fiscal year. So, given the fact that you're looking for community count growth, is it still reasonable to expect kind of a high-single or even low-double digit closings growth number for next year, or, again, just given the physical constraints of turnover and other -- the fact that cycle times are improving, but not back to where they were, any other items to consider? Bill Wheat : Sure, Mike. As we're looking to fiscal '24, we're -- and we've talked about this before. We always try to position ourselves with our lot position, with our homes and inventory so that we are in a position to deliver close to a double-digit growth, high-single, 10% type growth. And so, that's what we're doing again, is positioning our inventory so that we're in the position there in the market that we see today. I think it's there for us if we can get our lot positions and our homes in inventory ready for that. And with improved cycle times, that helps us improve our inventory turnover. And I think we focus a lot more on our inventory turn, our inventory conversion than we do backlog. Backlog is just really just a factor of when we choose to sign a sales contract on a home. We focus on our starts pace, what homes we have in inventory, and then we adjust when we're going to release those for sale based on when we have confidence that we can deliver that home. So, every home we start, we will close. And if we're turning those faster, then that will improve the inventory turnover and improve -- honestly, improves your visibility to see what our closings are going to be as well. So it's really about our starts pace, our inventory positioning, and then how efficiently can we turn that. Jessica Hansen : And as a reminder, we sell and close generally 35% to 40% of our homes intra-quarter, so you never see those in our backlog that we're reporting at a quarter-end anyway, which is why Bill is alluding to home starts and our homes in inventory being a better driver and an indicator of what we're going to close in a forward period. Mike Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask about lot costs. I think you said lots on a per square foot basis were actually flat sequentially, which is maybe a little surprising, given the shortage of lots out there, as you alluded to. Could you speak to a little around what's implied near term in your margin guidance around lot costs? And then just sort of more broadly, how are you thinking about managing inflation in lots going forward? Thank you. Mike Murray : What we're seeing today in the closings are lots that were contracted and acquired quite some time ago and coming through. So, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure coming through. Going forward, along with the lot scarcity, we're expecting to see lot costs coming through in forward margins at a higher level. There has certainly been inflation in land and in lot development costs and in finished lot prices. So, we expect to see that, but that's factored into our guidance and the way we're planning for the business next year. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then, secondly, just on the topic of mortgage rate buydowns, I'm curious if you can kind of educate us a little around how that dynamic may change depending where prevailing mortgage rates go. So, if we were to see a rise in mortgage rates from here, for example, what level or what ability do you have to -- what's kind of the maximum level of rate buydown, I guess, you could do? And conversely, if rates were to come down, would you continue to buy down rates by the same amount, or would you actually reduce kind of the size of your mortgage rate buydowns? Just curious around how all that may play out. Thank you. Paul Romanowski : Yeah. The rate buydown for us has been an effective incentive and to help us provide, as we've improved our cycle time as well, a certainty of close date and a certainty of home payment. And we have stayed roughly a point below the market, and we'll have to measure that as we move forward depending on where rates move, whether that be up or down. But we have found it to be our -- one of our most effective incentives, and we have been consistent in that execution and we'll continue to explore that as the interest rates move on a go-forward basis. Matthew Bouley : All right. Well, thank you, and good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric, your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. The gross margin progress in the quarter was notable and you talked about, I guess, a bit more progress in 4Q. I'm curious if you could help us get a sense of how we should be thinking about the path of gross margins from here. You've done a good job historically outlining ranges. But in the world, which seems like it's stabilizing for you now, how should we think about the range of path of gross margin? Bill Wheat : Yeah, Eric, it's -- what we have visibility to is basically what's in our backlog and what's been in our recent sales, and then, we certainly have visibility to what our recent cost levels have been. So, we've been seeing the costs on our more recent starts be lower. So, we've got some visibility to what that could produce. So, right now, as we look at our recent backlog in sales, we see a sequential modest improvement in margin up to kind of the high-23%-s to 24% range in Q4. You used the word stabilization. Last quarter, we used that word quite a bit. And so, we -- and we're still seeing that. And so, I think we are kind of settling into a more stable period here in terms of our costs, and demand has been pretty steady as well. So, I think we certainly don't see a trajectory in margin forever upward, but the modest improvement into the coming quarter looks like a pretty sustainable level here in the near-to-medium term. Mike Murray : A lot of tailwind from limited inventory supply at affordable price points are helpful to margins. And then, interest rates are the biggest risk to margins. Significant increases in interest rates will compress our margins. Eric Bosshard : Within this, you mentioned a moment ago, buying rates down a point below market has been a silver bullet or something that's been a catalyst for consumers to go ahead and sign a contract. I'm curious if you're seeing that's just the way it's going to be, or if you're seeing consumers becoming more comfortable with the reality in the days of a 3% mortgage are long gone. I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, can you get away with buying down rates less now? Are you seeing consumers a bit less sensitive? Or is this the medium-term reality that we should expect? Paul Romanowski : Yeah. The interest rate buydown is an incentive like many that we use, and we have a lot of different levers that we may pull market-by-market or community-by-community based on the needs of the buyers walking in the door. That has certainly been a hot button today because of the meteoric rise in rates and people's adjustment to that. As that adjusts, it will just ebb and flow with different incentives, whether that's closing costs or price or included features. It's been a good tool for us today. We will adjust to the market as it comes at us. Jessica Hansen : It was still on a majority of the homes we closed in the third quarter, but it was at a lower percentage than it was in Q2 in terms of the number of buyers utilizing that incentive. Eric Bosshard : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken, your line is live. Ken Zener : Good morning, everybody. David Auld : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zener : I want to take -- well, two questions here. One, I just want to kind of focus on capital and cash flow, and the other is going to be about just where we are on kind of the level of business by community versus the past. So, your ability to match EPS to cash flow has been improving, I think, $3 billion of cash flow, and I think about $4 billion in net income, so about 75%. Obviously, multi-family plays into that. But could you specifically talk to the 53% of option lots that you expect to be finished? What limits this from going higher, perhaps, and what kind of factors determine whether you're taking down finished or raw land in those options structures? And just refresh us on what that raw first developed lot cost is so we can understand the inflation inherent in those raw lots. Jessica Hansen : Sure. I'll start, Ken, and then I'm sure Mike or someone is going to chime in on the true ops piece of it. But in terms of the 53% that we said in our scripted remarks of our option lots that we expect to be purchase-finished, that's just at a point in time. So that's where we've already determined who's going to develop those lots for us, and we know we're going to take them down as a finished lot. That's by no means a ceiling. We're now closing 60%-plus of our houses quarter-to-quarter on a lot purchased from a third-party developer. And so, we -- in the normal course of business, we'll contract with a land seller as D.R. Horton, put the option [on the] (ph) contract and then we'll go find a land developer. So, the 53% is more of a floor than necessarily a ceiling. Mike Murray : I think you said it very well. We're going to take a piece of dirt and title it, and then, in that process, look to work with a third-party developer in some cases to assign that contract to. They'll acquire the land parcels and then they'll complete the lot development and sell us finished lots that we'll then start constructing homes on over time. So that 53% expected would go up, but we will choose, in some cases, to develop the neighborhood ourselves. In every one of our markets, we have great teams in place that are capable of developing their own lots, as well as negotiating to buy finished lots from third-party developers. Bill Wheat : And Ken, to circle back to your initial comment about capital and cash flow and percentage of cash flows relative to our earnings, we are seeing a big improvement in that this year, and that's what we're expecting to see this year. I would tell you that, that big move is being driven primarily by the improvement in our cycle times -- by our construction cycle times. We don't have as much capital tied up per home in our homes in inventory, because we're turning those faster. Definitely, our land shift over many years has been a component of that over time. But this year, specifically, it's more about our homes and inventory turnover improving. Ken Zener : Great. And so, I guess, just a follow-up to that, why would you want to develop land as opposed to, like, other builders or one specifically that is [indiscernible] of that? And then the other question, which I'm still struggling with when I just try to normalize housing is your starts pace or your pace per community is about 4.6 this year. It used to be about 3.6. Why is that the new normal, basically? I mean, I don't want to push down sales pace for no reason. But like, why are we so far above where we used to be as an industry? It's not just you guys. If you could explain that? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : Yeah. I think on the lot development question, we have talented teams across our platform. And there are instances where it's important to us in our starts pace is we have to have a lot on the ground. And so, controlling that process and being good at producing that lot is a talent that we're going to retain, and we have to continue to exercise that in order to do so. And some deals just make more sense for us to develop from a timing perspective and/or structure and/or size. And so, we're going to make that decision community-by-community across the platform. In terms of our absorption per community, I just -- I think that you've seen some larger communities that may be a portion of that impacting sales and positioning of those communities to drive more efficient activity, both on the construction and sales side. Bill Wheat : Yeah, I'm not sure I've got an answer for you for sure, Ken. If you don't know the answer, I'm sure we don't either in terms of why the industry has improved. The only thing I could come up with is, you have seen a shift in this industry to focus more on returns. And as we focused on returns, that really comes down to being more efficient with every asset you have. And so, if you can improve your absorption, improve your turns in each community, your returns on capital are improving. And so, perhaps you're seeing a little bit of that come through in your observation of looking at higher pace, higher absorptions over time across the industry. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital. Mike, your line is live. Mike Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of follow-ups on the rental side. So, there was a pretty well-publicized deal between yourselves and a large SFR company. Within the quarter and the guide, any color you can provide on how much of that deal already closed in 3Q? And whether or not the increase in the guide for the year reflects the full closing of that, or if there's going to be some carryover into fiscal '24? Jessica Hansen : Sure. Our guide does and will continue to just incorporate the homes that we've closed and our leasing pace and when those projects are available to be sold and marketed. And so, we've sold projects on a one-off basis, but as we continue to scale that business, it's opening up additional interested investors who -- there's institutional money that doesn't necessarily want to buy just one project at a time. They're interested in buying a portfolio of projects. The deal you're talking about was press speculation. We haven't publicly commented on any specifics of that transaction. But when we look at our rental communities, whether we're selling multiple projects to one investor or not, they are all individual real estate transactions. And so, we would continue to point to our disclosures on a unit basis in terms of the number of completed homes we have and rental units in terms of what that forward pace of sales looks like, and we'll continue to do sales of individual projects, and I'm sure we'll continue to do packages of sales going forward. Mike Dahl : Okay, got it. And I guess a follow-up there, so without the specifics. Given the total units you are now guiding to and the inventory that you've outlined, you will close a significant portion of your existing inventory in 4Q. And so, I fully understand that this is a growth part of your business for the next couple of years. But just circling back to a question, I think, earlier on the call around specifics on '24, should we be thinking that you've kind of pulled forward the timing of when some of that inventory you might have expected to close in terms of closing in '23 versus '24, so maybe it's a little lower in '24, or are you really in a position where even with this increased guide, you can keep growing in '24 off that? Jessica Hansen : We've generally been talking about our rental platform combined, but in our 10-Q, you can see a breakdown and we do give our unit breakdowns separately. So, '24 is going to be a pretty big growth year from a multi-family perspective and we're going to continue to scale the single family. But as we scale both sides of the business, it could still be choppy quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, with ultimate overall growth on an annual basis expected. Mike Dahl : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hey, guys. Good morning. So, very impressive progress on the cycle times and the cost front. I'm guessing what we are seeing now is probably somewhat of a lagged effect of the big pull back in starts the industry saw late last year and the negotiating power you had over the trades at that time and, of course, the pull back in lumber. You are not the only ones ramping your start pace now. I think we are hearing similar messages from most of your larger competitors. Maybe some of that is at the expense of the smaller privates, but I think it is clear the industry start pace is going to be accelerating here for the next handful of quarters at least. So, what are your thoughts on the sustainability of the progress you have made on cycle times and costs heading into '24? And more specifically, what are you seeing from your trades? Are they ramping their headcount in anticipation of an accelerating start pace going forward? Are they seeing more capacity out there that would support this type of growth without cost inflation following? David Auld : Yes, it's something we work on every day. Aggregating market share involves aggregating trade base and materials within those communities. And we've been talking about a consistent start pace when we've been talking about simplifying the process and making it easier for our trades to get to and from the job with the right materials, with a complete understanding of what they're doing. That is allowing us to aggregate these trades. Our goal, our communication is we want to be the builder they want to work for. And we do a lot of things to try to make their job easier and more profitable without coming in and trying to renegotiate price every quarter. So, is it sustainable? Yes. I think that we are going to continue to focus on that. And as time goes on, we'll get better at it, and basically build capacity month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, on a continual basis. Alan Ratner : Got it. Appreciate the thoughts there. Second, Jessica, you mentioned earlier that while you're still offering mortgage rate buydowns on the majority of closings, it did tick a little bit lower quarter-over-quarter in terms of the share of closings that had those buydowns. I was curious if you -- a, if you had that specific data you could share with us? But, b, are you seeing any sensitivity to demand in the communities maybe where you are dialing back those buydowns? On one hand, the buydowns are probably putting you guys in such a strong competitive advantage versus the resale market. But on the other hand, with inventory as tight as it is and demand seemingly pretty strong, it would seem like you should have some ability to pull back on those without impacting demand too much. I'm just curious the interplay between that. Paul Romanowski : The use of the rate buy downs is about 10% less than it has been as we look over the last few quarters. And that sensitivity is a community by community and buyer by buyer process. We have great sales agents in each of our communities that go through that experience with every buyer that walks in and finding what's important to them is what they do very well. And so, we'll continue, as we mentioned, to utilize that. And certainly that reduction shows some stability in rates. Although they've moved up, they've remained in a similar range. And I think people getting comfortable with their purchasing power has allowed some of the relief of that use and/or them not being as concerned about it as the thing that is important to them in the purchase. Alan Ratner : Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Truman Patterson from Wolfe Research. Truman, your line is live. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. First, this has been touched on a little bit earlier in the call, but just trying to get a big picture overview of the banking environment and what it means for Horton. Has the banking environment currently negatively impacted your developer partners kind of outside of 4 Star, their ability to access capital for future projects? For smaller private builders, are you actually seeing them kind of pull back on spec construction, land deals, et cetera? Mike Murray : I think with a lot of the third-party developers we work with, we have a long relationship with them. And in a lot of cases, their banking or financing sources are kind of looking through their developer, looking through to the land contract and working with us and they take great comfort in that. And we've been able to continue to sign up new deals over the past quarter that have secured new financing commitments for the third-party developers through the process. Is it as easy as it was or as inexpensive as it was? Certainly not. It is more challenging. I do think that the banking industry is being more selective in who and at what levels they're choosing to support third-party developers. On the private builder side, we've probably seen a little more opportunity to step into some positions and help those builders with some liquidity and opportunities by taking some of their lots or stepping into different positions. So, it has been, if anything, a bit accretive to the business, and we're just here to help. Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you. And then, you all have discussed previously about rotating to smaller square footage offerings to combat affordability. Any way you can help us think about -- are you seeing consumers actually prefer these smaller square footage homes over the past six months? Or based on the offerings that you have out there, are consumers still kind of preferring the larger square footage homes? Jessica Hansen : They prefer what they can afford. So, what we generally see is that buyers continue to want as much square footage as they can get, but they're constrained by what they can afford, which is why we continue to start more and more of our smaller floor plans. We did see a slight tick down on a year-over-year basis again by about 2% in the terms of square footage on our homes closed. It was flat sequentially. So, we would expect just continued very gradual moves down in our average square footage today. Truman Patterson : All right. Thank you, and good luck in '24. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Truman. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that build cycles have come down 30 days from peak levels and you expect them to continue in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about where they are now versus historical levels? And then, beyond the fourth quarter as you look into next year, how should we think about further potential improvement, like what that could do for your asset turns? Paul Romanowski : Yeah, we are -- today down that 30 days puts us at about five-and-a-half months in our current cycle time, which is still slightly above our historical averages. And so, we see a trend towards -- more towards our normalized and consistent cycle times. That's going to depend on labor availability and our ability to continue to aggregate that labor. As you see start space increase across the country, we could certainly see some pressure on that, but feel comfortable in our position and with the trade capacity that we have in labor out in the markets today. Mike Murray : Our build time of that at five-and-a-half months has come down about a month, and we probably have another month, month-and-a-half to go to get back to where we have been historically when we're operating at a more efficient level. And then, there's probably another 45 days to 60 days after that, what we call, construction completion until we hit the home closing date. So on average, we're looking to get to a 2 or a little better than 2 times turn of inventory units implies that six to slightly less than six months start to closing cycle time. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. That's helpful. So there's still more opportunity. And then, just on the rental profit outlook for the fourth quarter, the guidance is units will be up quite a bit, but you're thinking about rental profits being down. Should we think about gross margins there being lower than kind of core homebuilding longer term? Is there any dynamic that's driving that margin kind of cadence short-term, or is this something we should be thinking about it longer-term? Bill Wheat : Yeah, it's really a short-term thing, as Mike mentioned earlier, part of it is the mix of the projects that we see coming through and the time in which those homes were constructed was the time when we were seeing higher construction costs as well. So, we really see that as a Q4 event and as we look longer-term from a gross margin perspective and really pre-tax margin perspective, we would expect the rental to still be higher than our homebuilding margins overall. Maybe a little bit of anomaly here in Q4, but not a long-term phenomenon. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I would now like to hand the call back to David Auld for closing remarks. David Auld : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in November. And finally, congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. Continue to compete, win every day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Tom. And good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 financial results. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q, all of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-K late next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to David Auld, our Executive Vice Chair. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica. And good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Paul Romanowski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  When we talk about our results, I'd like to congratulate Paul on his well-deserved promotion to CEO that was effective October 1. We have been preparing for this transition internally for quite some time. We are positioning our leadership throughout the company for the future, and I will still be actively involved as executive vice chair of board of directors. Our executive team remains in place with the same individuals and Paul has the support of our executive, region, and division leadership. He is a proven leader who has been successful throughout his group.  Now on to our results. The D.R. Horton team finished the year with solid fourth quarter results, highlighted by earnings of $4.45 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $2 billion on a 9% increase in revenues to $10.5 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 19.2%. For the year, earnings per diluted share was $13.82 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $35.5 million, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.8%. We closed a record 91,204 homes and apartments this year in our homebuilding and rental operations. Our cash flow from operations for 2023 was $4.3 billion. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the year was 29.7% and our return on equity was 22.7%. Despite continued high mortgage rates and inflationary pressures, our net sales orders increased 39% from the prior-year quarter. As a result, both new and existing homes at affordable price points is limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  We are focused on consolidating market share by supplying more homes at affordable price points to meet homebuyer demand, while maximizing the returns and capital efficiency in each of our communities. With improvements in both labor capacity and availability of materials, our cycle times are decreasing, positioning us to improve our housing inventory turns. We are well-positioned with our experienced operators, affordable product offerings, flexible lot supply, and strong capital and liquidity positions to generate strong cash flows and produce consistent returns.  We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, including returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Paul? Paul Romanowski : Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 decreased 5% to $4.45 per diluted share compared to $4.67 per share in the prior-year quarter. Earnings for the year decreased 16% to $13.82 per diluted share compared to $16.51 in fiscal 2022. Net income for the quarter decreased 7% to $1.5 billion on consolidated revenues of $10.5 billion. And for the year, net income decreased 19% to $4.7 billion on revenues of $35.5 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed compared to $9.4 billion on 23,212 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,900, up 1% sequentially and down 5% from the prior-year quarter. Mike? Michael Murray : Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased 39% to 18,939 homes and order value increased 34% from the prior year to $7.3 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and down from 32% in the prior-year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $383,100, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from the prior-year quarter. To adjust to changing market conditions and higher mortgage rates, we have increased our use of incentives and are reducing the size of our homes where possible to provide better affordability for our homebuyers. We expect to continue utilizing a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024, particularly rate buydowns in the current interest rate environment. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the fourth quarter was 25.1%, up 180 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The increase in our gross margin from June to September reflects the slight increase in our average sales price and lower stick and brick costs on homes closed during the quarter.  On a per square-foot basis, home sales revenues were up 2.5% sequentially, while stick and brick cost per square foot decreased 2.5% and lot costs increased 6%. As Mike mentioned, we expect to continue offering a higher level of incentives in fiscal 2024 to help address affordability. Due to recent increases in volatility in mortgage rates, our incentive costs have increased on recent sales, and we expect our homebuilding gross margins to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : In the fourth quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 2% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 6.6%, down 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. For the year, homebuilding SG&A was 7.1% of revenues, up 30 basis points from fiscal 2022. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 21,100 homes in the September quarter, down 8% from the June quarter. We ended the year with 42,000 homes in inventory, down 9% from a year ago and down 4% sequentially. 27,000 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold, of which 7,000 were completed.  For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our construction cycle time decreased by a month from the third quarter, reflecting improvements in the supply chain. We will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions, and we expect further improvements in our cycle times and housing inventory turns in fiscal 2024. Mike? Michael Murray : Our homebuilding lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 568,000 lots, of which 25% were owned and 75% were controlled through purchase contracts. 35% of our total owned lots are finished and 54% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.3 billion, up 7% sequentially. Our current quarter investments consisted of $1.5 billion for finished lots, $580 million for land development and $290 million for land acquisition. For the year, our homebuilding investments in lots, land, and development totaled $8 billion, up 6% from fiscal 2022. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $217 million of pre-tax income on $1.4 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,006 single-family rental homes and 1,582 multifamily rental units.  For the full year, our rental operations generated $524 million of pre-tax income on $2.6 billion of revenues from the sale of 6,175 single-family rental homes and 2,112 multifamily rental units.  Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.7 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.4 billion of multifamily rental properties. Our rental operations generated significant increases in both revenues and profits this year as our platform is maturing and expanding across more markets. Due to the rise in interest rates and volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets, we are not providing separate guidance for our rental closings in fiscal 2024. Based on the current pipeline of rental projects, we do expect to have more multifamily unit closings in fiscal 2024 than in fiscal 2023. Bill? Bill Wheat : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $550 million for the fourth quarter on 4,986 lots sold with pre-tax income of $95 million. For the full year, Forestar delivered 14,040 lines, generating $1.4 billion of revenues and $222 million of pre-tax income with a pre-tax profit margin of 15.4%.  Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at September 30th was 79,200 lots. 60% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $410 million of our finished lots purchased in the fourth quarter were from Forestar.  Forestar had approximately $1 billion of liquidity at year-end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 5.5%. Forestar is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to consolidate significant market share over the next few years, with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton.  Mike? Michael Murray : Financial Services earned $85 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $220 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 38.9%. For the year, financial services earned $283 million of pre-tax income on $802 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%.  During the fourth quarter, virtually all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 76% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 51% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 at an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. First-time home buyers represented 55% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter.  Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach is disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support our operating platform and produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.  During fiscal 2023, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $4.3 billion, and our cash provided by homebuilding operations was $3.1 billion. Over the past five years, our homebuilding operations have generated $9.6 billion of cash flow. At September 30th, we had $7.5 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3.9 billion of cash and $3.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. We repaid $400 million of senior notes this quarter, and our debt at September 30th totaled $5.1 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024.  Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.3% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 5.1%. At September 30th, our stockholders' equity was $22.7 billion and book value per share was $67.78, up 20% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 22.7%.  During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $84 million for a total of $341 million of dividends paid during the year. We repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock for $423 million during the quarter. And for the year, we repurchased 11.1 million shares for $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year-end. In October, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our common stock, replacing our previous authorization. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : As we look forward to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect challenging market conditions to persist with continued uncertainty regarding mortgage rates, the capital markets and general economic conditions that may significantly impact our business.  In our December quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 18,500 to 19,000 homes.  We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be approximately 23.7% to 24.2% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter to be around 7.7% to 7.9%.  We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of between 20% and 25%, and we expect our income tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 24.5% in the first quarter. We are well positioned to continue consolidating market share in both our home building and rental operations. Our fiscal 2024 home closings volume, pricing, and margins in our homebuilding, rental, financial services, and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and our efforts to meet the market by balancing pace and price to maximize returns.  For the full year of fiscal 2024, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 86,000 to 89,000 homes.  We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 in the range of 24% to 24.5%. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count in addition to dividend payments of around $400 million.  We will continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among our core homebuilding operations, our rental operations, maintaining conservative leverage and strong liquidity, paying an increased dividend, and consistently repurchasing shares.  David? David Auld : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, and broad geographic footprint across 118 markets. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and loan leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to meet changing market conditions and continue aggregating market share.  We plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, while consistently returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton team for your focus and our work. Due to your efforts, we just completed our 22nd consecutive year as the largest and strongest builder in the United States, and we look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide homeownership opportunities to more American families during 2024.  With my transition to executive vice chair, this will be my last public earnings call. It has been an honor and a privilege to represent and report on the D.R. Horton team's remarkable efforts for the past 10 years.  Thank you all again. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question this morning is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John Lovallo : First question is just on the gross margin in the quarter of 25.1%. That was well above your expectations, above, I believe, 23.5% to 24%. Despite what seems like a greater use of incentives and perhaps even a higher cost of incentives, can you just help us kind of work through some of the puts and takes on gross margin in the quarter versus your expectations? Bill Wheat : The second half of the fiscal year, we had a little more relative stability in the rate environment, and so we were able to level off our incentives really in Q3 and Q4. We also then had a little bit of price traction that allowed our average sales price to tick up just a tad in the fourth quarter. And then really, one of the biggest benefits was we did see continued improvement in lumber costs. And so, our overall stick and brick costs on our homes came down in the quarter. We do think we basically realized the majority of that lumber cost benefit in the near term and within the more recent rise in interest rates and the use of incentives. That's why we're guiding down for Q1, but we had some benefits that supported the increase in gross margin in Q4. John Lovallo : Maybe sticking with gross margin. As we look forward into the first quarter, the 23.7% to 24.2%, if we think about the sequential decline that's implied in there, it sounds like there's going to be higher incentives and, again, maybe a little bit of higher costs. You mentioned that the lumber benefit might be through. What are the other sort of puts and takes that we should consider in that sequential margin? Michael Murray : I think you summed it up pretty well, John. I think we see higher incentives coming forward with the rapid rise in interest rates through the last six weeks or so. A little bit of moderation last week, which was helpful, but one week doesn't make a trend, I don't think. And we do sell a significant number of the homes we closed in the quarter during that quarter. I think for the fourth quarter, 39% of our closings were sold in the quarter. So we're at a pretty real-time indication of margins in the business as it comes through. Operator : Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore. Stephen Kim : Congratulations on the good results. You gave an interesting \u2013 well, you gave a guide for $3 billion in homebuilding cash flow for next year. I wanted to get a sense from you, how much of that do you think is going to be benefited by a reduction in work in process inventory? Bill Wheat : We are able with our improved cycle times. We are seeing improved inventory turns and our assumption next year is that we will see some further improvement in cycle times and inventory turns. So we are able to operate with a relatively lower level of homebuilding inventory. However, we're also guiding to a volume increase. And so, I don't necessarily expect an absolute decrease in our homes and inventory, but we do expect to be turning it faster. So that's definitely a contributing factor to the cash flow. Stephen Kim : But not an actual reduction in the WIP levels, okay. That's helpful. So that means that it's really coming from the income and, I guess, maybe a reduction in land assets? Would that be fair? Bill Wheat : Or it's just an improvement in our turns of our land assets. So, yes, primarily from profits that's resulting from the improved turns. Stephen Kim : Second question is related to rate buydowns. Could you give us a sense for what the average rate actually used in the quarter, in your September quarter, was for your customers. And if we were to look at sort of what your average is for, let's say, orders being taken today, what would that average rate be? Paul Romanowski : The average rate can move quite a bit through the quarter, but we tend to stay about 1 to 1.25 points below market at any given time. And today, we're offering on an FHA government loans, roughly in the 5.99% rate and, on a conventional 6.25%, which is right in that range of 1.25, 1.5 below today. Stephen Kim : And is that what most people are actually using? Paul Romanowski : About 60% of our total closings are used with some form of a rate buy-down. And so, a big percentage of \u2013 and the most successful incentive we have seen has been to impact that monthly cost of homeownership through some form of rate buy down. Stephen Kim : Sorry, just to clarify, you're saying that 60% of your closings in some form of buy down, do you know what the average rate cutting across all of the kinds of buy-downs that people are using, what that actual rate was underpinning the mortgages? Paul Romanowski : I'm going to say probably in the 6-ish range. Operator : Your next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer from Deutsche Bank. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Congrats on executing so well this year. I appreciate also the effort to give the visibility for the full year here. I just wanted to talk maybe about those inventory turns a little bit further. Your guidance for closing suggests something above 2 times on your current homes and inventory level. I know that's an important threshold for you guys. Just wondering maybe then what the starts look like over the next couple of quarters to make sure that you deliver on that closing guidance in the back half, but also sort of gear up for growth again in 2025, while maintaining that 2x target, how the starts could look? Jessica Hansen : Our starts should tick down a little bit sequentially, but our base case, subject to market conditions, as everything and the strength of the spring, is that we would expect to increase our search gradually, quarter to quarter as we move throughout the year, to position ourselves to deliver on the guidance that we've talked about and then obviously to also exit 2024 position to grow into 2025. So we're working market by market, community by community to improve our production capabilities. And what we want to do is make sure that as we're increasing our starts that it's sustainable. So that's why you're just going to see it gradually happen throughout the year. Joe Ahlersmeyer : Thinking about your return on inventory on a trailing basis, it has been normalizing, of course. But where do you think that can settle out if you've got headwinds maybe on the profitability side from land and incentives, the tailwinds from that production efficiency. Could we actually sort of settle out here in the high 20s? Is that realistic? Bill Wheat : Well, the way we're running our business, the way we underwrite our land deals, that's our focus, with our focus on purchasing finished lots and as many deals as we can. Yes, our goal would be to keep that return on inventory in the homebuilding business as high as we can. And so, definitely, mid- to high 20s is a good level for us. It does fluctuate with where gross margins are. So we've been coming down off of some of the peak gross margins we saw last year, but definitely mid to high 20s is a level that we're striving to achieve. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Joe stole one of my questions. But looking at the guide for next year, are you anticipating much alteration in mix in terms of geography or price points? And I'm particularly interested in some of the smaller markets where you all are really the only large builder, a couple of the acquisitions you've done. What percentage of deliveries next year do you think might come from markets like that, however you want to define it? Michael Murray : Don't probably have a good breakdown of deliveries by market, stratified by market size or recent entrants, but we do expect to see probably a rotation to smaller home footprints and introduction of smaller plans where we can get municipality approvals. Again, just to maintain the affordability, I think we will see that we're going to continue to roll with starts, but the compressed cycle times that we've gotten out of our construction process is going to allow us to deliver a lot more homes on fewer homes carried in inventory at any given quarter end date. Jessica Hansen : Carl, this doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I do want to let people know that in our investor presentation we're going to post, as we usually do, post the call, we've updated our market share dominant slide pretty dramatically to make sure it aligns with all of the markets we operate in. We did a lot of work with Zonda and our internal data. And so, now instead of just reporting on the top 50 US housing markets and where we rank in those, we're talking about all 118. And so, it will give you some more insight into where we are in terms of whether we're number 1, top 5, top 10. Out of the 118 markets we're in today, only 7 we're not top 10 in and we went through those last night and they are all markets that we essentially have just entered within the last year or two. So we would expect to be top 10 very quickly and then move up into the top 5 and certainly continue to work on becoming number 1.  So it doesn't answer geographic mix, but I did want to kind of plug the fact that we gave incremental data on market share that we hadn't historically put out there. Carl Reichardt : Just as a follow-up, I know you're not guiding on the rental business in 2024, it's becoming a bigger portion of PTI and obviously taking up some balance sheet. From an institutional investor perspective on both multifamily and single family, how has that appetite fared for the projects you're selling at stabilized occupancy? Obviously, spreads have come in there, but there's also a lot of capital, I would guess, chasing both asset classes. So I'm just sort of curious what you're seeing from those customers. Paul Romanowski : We are still seeing strong interest, Carl, from the institutional investors that are out there. As you mentioned, the spreads have come in. And we're going to see some volatility in gross margin as we move through this process and move through the markets of higher rates, but still seeing consistent activity. I still feel we are in a great position to be the dominant supplier of single-family rental and continuing to grow our multifamily platform. Operator : Your next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from J.P. Morgan. Mike Rehaut : I wanted to focus for a moment on the fiscal 2024 closings growth guidance of up 4% to 7%. It seems like that's a little bit below maybe what you typically shoot for in kind of like a high single-digit range, if I'm not mistaken. And I'm just curious if that's a function of maybe the current backdrop with the recent move in rates. Also, obviously, your backlog is still down over 20% year-over-year. Just kind of wondering if there's a little bit of a timing gap here given the backlog, maybe given the current environment, that high single-digit rate is something we should think about you guys maybe returning to in 2025, all else equal? Jessica Hansen : Great question, Mike. We expected it. We do talk about always positioning ourselves for growth, and you typically hear us talk about plus or minus 10% is how we're going to position the company. If you look at how we're exiting 2023 though and our guide for fiscal 2024 closing, it does already assume our typical 2 times housing turn, actually a little bit better than that at the high end. So 2.04 times to 2.11 times would be our guide. And so, it's already incorporating our improvement in cycle times. And if we continue to be able to have success with that throughout the year, we'll consider that in what we talk about publicly in terms of what we're able to deliver for fiscal 2024. But as we sit here in November, that's a realistic expectation for closing with the visibility that we have today. It's not necessarily that we've seen a big falloff in demand. Obviously, our sales were up very strong. And so, it's more a function of the houses we have in inventory and our cycle times. Michael Murray : This is Mike. Just following on with that is that our lot position is very strong right now. We own 50,000 lots that are finished, and there's obviously more that are in the controlled portion of our portfolio, that \u2013 as we see the market unfold for the year, we will be able to accelerate starts to meet any increased demand.  Coming into 2023, we saw a rate spike at the end 2022 and we were a little concerned about the year and the outlook we gave last year at this time. And the team stepped up and delivered a great year in fiscal 2023 and against that backdrop. So positioning for conservatism in the year, but always are \u2013 have a desire to grow and to grow in that double-digit level. Mike Rehaut : I guess also just wanted to circle back. You had mentioned with regard to sticks and bricks, 6% lot inflation. Is that something that has been accelerating, I guess, not just sticks and bricks, but maybe just more broadly, where is a lot as well as construction cost inflation for the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis? And how do you expect that to play out in 2024 based on current trends? And would that require some amount of price appreciation to offset, let's say, to maintain your fiscal \u2013 your first quarter gross margins? Bill Wheat : Mike, sticks, and bricks, we've been \u2013 the last couple of quarters have been seeing the benefit of lower lumber costs. However, across most other cost categories, in the vertical construction costs, we are still seeing modest inflation. So on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, our stick and brick costs were down 3.5% on a per square foot basis. But our lot costs were up 11%. So we're seeing more inflation in our lot costs. And so, as we look forward into fiscal 2024, we would expect to continue to see inflation in our lot costs as land moves through and development cost inflation continues. And I think we would still expect to still see some modest inflation in some of the other stick and brick categories. There has been some recent moderation in lumber costs. As we move through 2024, we'd expect to see some benefit from. But overall, I think we still expect costs to show moderate inflation. As far as price appreciation with the current rate environment, the volatility and the recent rise in rates, we're not expecting any price appreciation. Our base case would probably expect a little bit of downward pressure on prices. And as we've already talked about, we are using higher incentives going into the first part of the year.  Now rate environment can change. Strength of the market can change as we go into the spring, and so we'll adjust depending on what we see in the market as we get further into the year. Jessica Hansen : Carl asked about geographic mix, but that's a good point here in terms of just our reported average sales price. We are continuing to shift, as we said in our prepared remarks, to more and more of our smaller floor plans to address affordability issues in the market. So we could have some downward pressure on price that's solely just a function of product mix. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew Bouley : Just given all the, of course, interest rate volatility these past several weeks, I'm curious. Number one, given what you're doing with rate buy-downs, are you finding that sales pace is reacting quickly to these sort of numbing moves in interest rates? That's number one. And number two, I guess, just any color on your own sales pace into October and November, how you're kind of thinking about seasonality of orders here in the first quarter? Paul Romanowski : As you know, we don't report on sales \u2013 forecast on sales, but we are pleased with our sales thus far into October. And you certainly see fluctuations in traffic when we see the kind of moves that we've seen over the last couple of weeks, both up and down in rates. But with our ability to hold stable rates through our interest rate incentives, we've been able to convert pretty consistently with the buyers that we've had out there. But any time you have fluctuations in rates, we're going to see people pause for a period of time until they settle into the reality of what they can afford. Jessica Hansen : We're also going into the seasonally slowest time of the year. So November and December typically are the slowest sales months as you get to the holidays. So, we're going to continue to focus ourselves on meeting the market, but not making any drastic adjustments to our business plan, and we're going to wait and see how the spring unfolds and make sure that we're continuing to start houses going into the spring. Matthew Bouley : Secondly, on the rental side, I know you're not guiding the top line in 2024. You did mention that multifamily units would be \u2013 I think you said, would be rising in 2024 year-over-year. Clearly, there is a lot of supply coming online, I think, in the multifamily world broadly. What can you say around the margin side and what you might be expecting on the margins of those multifamily unit sales next year? Michael Murray : I think we will see probably margins compress a bit on those multifamily sales just if interest rates have come up and cap rates tend to come up. The question of how much supply is out there is really specific to a given project in a given submarket that that project serves. And our team has done a great job of looking at those submarkets when we made the decision to move forward with the projects, cognizant of what was available in the marketplace, both ahead of us and behind us from a supply perspective. So we feel pretty good about being able to deliver into a healthy demand environment. We're still seeing good lease-ups in our rental properties, in line with expectations. So we're very encouraged by that. Operator : Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Alan Ratner : First off, congrats to Paul and David, and good luck with the transition. Second, I think the topic that we get the most questions on are the sustainability of the rate buydowns that you guys are offering and the industry is offering right now. I guess my question to you, and I hear through \u2013 I listened through some of your comments on the puts and takes on margin and lot cost inflation starting to accelerate and maybe stick and brick costs also inflecting higher again after being a good guide this year. Is there a point where you look at your margin, which, obviously, it's very healthy today, but a point where it becomes harder to continue buying down that rate 100 basis points, 150 basis points, and what is that threshold for you? Michael Murray : We're going to operate the neighborhoods, but focused on return as usual, Alan, and it's going to be a pace and a price conversation continually. And the rates buy-downs, the incentives that we offer, it's just part of the mix of the cost environment that we deal with. And while we've seen some nice relief in the stick and brick cost, we have had some price pressure on other sides of it, but fuel prices have come down. That should give us a little bit of relief across a pretty broad spectrum of commodities as well as delivery costs. So it's a constant give-and-take on the cost and the margins. And our primary focus and guiding star is returns. Jessica Hansen : And we're going into the year with a very strong start. We did say that our gross margins are expected to decline in Q1, but we're coming off a 25.1% in Q4, which is below the peaks that we achieved last year. But it's still a very healthy gross margin that gives us some room to meet the market and maximize returns and still post very healthy returns. Alan Ratner : Makes sense. Absolutely. The starting point is certainly very healthy, Jessica. So I appreciate that. Second question, would love to hear your thoughts on just credit availability in general. On one hand, I think there's certainly a nice tailwind to the public builders given your balance sheet and access to liquidity and capital and the ability to use that to take market share. On the other hand, your suppliers and your trades are certainly dependent on credit availability to fund their businesses, and headlines out of the Fed report yesterday, obviously, point to continued tightening there and your land developers probably are dependent on bank credit as well. So in your conversations with trades and suppliers and developers, are you starting to see any indications of stress throughout the channel as a result of credit tightening? And on the flip side, are you seeing any opportunities come from that? Paul Romanowski : I think anytime you see rates like they have been in the capital markets, a bit in flux, then we're going to see some headwinds from our developers, from less capitalized builders. And it will create some opportunities, but we feel like we've got a good plan and open communications with our vendors, our trades and our lot suppliers to continue to work through those processes. Operator : Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Congratulations on the transition to David and Paul. I'm wondering, understanding your entire offering is fairly affordable, I'm wondering if there's a specific buyer type you're seeing as kind of best positioned to weather higher for longer rates. Are your move-up buyers meaningfully outperforming first-time buyers? Are you seeing more buyers move down market to more affordable offerings? I'm just wondering what you're seeing there and if you're making any sort of strategic shifts to target a different mix of buyers. Michael Murray : I think our buyers are focused primarily on affordability. And for us, the way we deliver that affordability is through the monthly payment process. And that's obviously been a big driver for the rate buydowns, but also introducing smaller product footprints. De-amenitizing some of the homes a bit and letting people do things to improve their homes after the closing when their financial position perhaps has changed and they can afford a little more. But it's continuing to hit a price point relative to median income, so that we can find a place to work in that family's budget. Jessica Hansen : And we still really like over half of our business being first-time homebuyers because despite what's happening with interest rates, those buyers need a place to live. They don't already own a home, so they're not a discretionary buyer. They're in the market looking at buy versus rent opportunities. So, if we can stay competitive with the rental market on that front, we're going to continue to capture first-time homebuyer market share. Anthony Pettinari : Just following up on something Mike said, I think this time last year, you elected not to give very detailed full-year outlook for 2023 with the volatile rate environment. I guess big picture, can you talk about what is giving you confidence to provide more detailed guidance now with mortgage rates near 8%? Is it just the experience of kind of managing through higher rates and the success of the buy-down? Or are you seeing something different with the consumer? Just wondering how you could contrast where we are now versus 12 months ago? Michael Murray : I think 12 months ago, we were facing two big issues. We were still trying to solve the production supply chain challenges and our cycle times were very elongated. So we had a hard time determining exactly what homes we're going to finish and deliver. And that was also a big interaction with the rate buy-down process because we can only buy rates down for certain forward amount of time in a cost-effective manner, and so being able to pinpoint when those homes would deliver into the buy-down environment.  You touched on the second point with the rates. Yes, we start facing some rate uncertainty and increases, but we have been able to manage through that over the past 12 months, and the team has delivered a really strong year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken Zener : I'd like to take a step back just to bridge three CEOs, if we could here. So it was 10 years ago \u2013 David, congratulations \u2013 that you got on the call. At the time \u2013 and it's going to be about margins. Don talked about at the time 20-10-10, so 20% gross margin, 2 turns. David, as we all recall, when you came on shortly thereafter, Express, obviously, a great product. And you guys pulled gross margins down to \u2013 guidance in the 19%, 21% focusing on asset turns, consistent with Don's comments, and it's been great. Now, Paul, I certainly want to give you a chance to give your fingerprints on this. Could you comment on those prior \u2013 well, CEOs' comments, why it's different today and perhaps tie that into your to top rising comments on your exposure to non-top 50 markets. That's my first question. Paul Romanowski : Well, the team that's at the table is a team that was at the table last quarter last year and the prior several. We have a great position and are aligned as a company, not just from this group, but with our regional leadership and our division leadership. And we have continued to focus on returns community by community. And we have the benefit now of a wider footprint across the geographic area that we've expanded on, which is going to continue to provide strength for us and supply as we continue to expand in those markets. So the short version is we feel really good about where we are. I don't feel the need to put a stamped footprint or fingerprint on something unique and different because we have a strong team and a great operation in play, and a good playbook that we are executing on every day. David Auld : Ken, I was going to try to stay off this Q&A. Everything \u2013 you go back 45-year history, the goal of the company is to be the low-cost provider of affordable housing and create opportunities for first-time homebuyers to get in a home. And everything we've done through those years has been to position the company a little bit better and a little bit stronger. And the awakening of 2008, 2009 and 2010, I think, created a discipline in operations that made the transition from margin to return pretty much an industry standard today. You listen to other builder calls and everybody is talking about returns, cash flow, deleveraging and derisking their land pipeline. I don't see that changing. The industry has matured, the market share consolidation by the publics, the difficulty of putting lots on the ground, the difficulty of building houses, restrictions on capital, all of those things are forcing a discipline on the industry and allowing the \u2013 what I think the national builders to gain market share quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter. So our internal focus is going to continue to be project by project, driving improvements to efficiency, simplifying product, making it \u2013 even as overall individual component price increases, the availability of housing to the first-time homebuyer continues to be there. So that's our goal. That's all we think about every day.  And I think, earlier, somebody said something about sustainable. Everything we do, if it's not sustainable, we leave it in the trash pile and move on. So scalable, sustainable, consistent, and transparent. That's this team that's built alignment throughout our company, and I don't see that changing. Paul will do things differently than I do. He's taller than I am. That's a good thing. Coming down the ladder, I feel very good about the position we're in. Never been as well-positioned as a company. Ken Zener : Yes. I can see Paul was taller. I was watching some of his YouTube videos. I guess not everybody is focused on returns as you. And I would say that you're \u2013 I'm sorry. So focused on returns, I'd like you to expand on your comments that \u2013 if you're taking down \u2013 54% of your options are finished, is that a fair basis for your mix of closings coming from finished lots? And are those geared more toward the non-top 50 markets, which is about a third of your closings? Jessica Hansen : So to the first part of your question, we're over 60% of the houses that we're closing today were developed this past fiscal year on a lot developed by a third party. So the 54% is kind of a minimum that we would expect to take down finished because in a lot of cases, as you likely recall, industry practices for \u2013 we have hundreds of land professionals across the country that are very good at what they do. So they'll go out, source the land, negotiate it with the land seller, put it under contract and then we'll go find a third-party developer. So in a lot of cases, some of that stuff and the other 45% that we maybe today has not identified who's going to develop it. By the time we bring it on our balance sheet, it will be from a third party. And then in terms of the markets where we're buying more finished lots versus not, do you expect that to skew? Paul Romanowski : No, I don't expect that to skew. Ken, we continue to build our developer partnerships in all markets. And I would expect that, over time, you'll continue to see a rise, not a reduction in the number of lots we buy fully developed as we derisk our balance sheet and our lot pipeline. Ken Zener : Thank you very much. Thank you, David. David Auld : Thank you, Ken. I appreciate the support through the years. Operator : Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is around the community count growth. Any thoughts there on how we should be thinking about that for 2024? Is something in that mid to high single-digit range as you talked about in the past still a reasonable goal? Jessica Hansen : On a year-over-year basis, Sue, yes. I think we would expect \u2013 as we look at fiscal 2024, we've driven a lot of increased absorption out of our communities for quite some time now. And so we're shifting to some of that growth now coming from just incremental community count and continuing to expand our footprint. So I think mid to high single is a good base case. We don't specifically guide the community count for a reason. It's pretty hard to predict just because there are so many moving pieces to communities coming on and offline, but I do think that's a reasonable base case assumption that we'll obviously update as we move throughout the year if necessary. Susan Maklari : You're guiding to buying back $1.5 billion of stock over the next year, which is up versus the $1 billion that you did in this past year. Can you just talk about what's driving that confidence? How you're thinking about the cash generation of the business as you go forward from here and what that could mean in terms of capital allocation priorities? Bill Wheat : It's been the goal of ours to consistently repurchase shares over time and grow that over time. And so, this is just another step in that progression. And in the business, as we see I'd say, increased visibility and confidence in our ability to generate cash flow into fiscal 2024. That's given us a little more certainty around being able to guide a little more specifically to that growth than we have in the past.  As Mike said earlier, a year ago, we were concerned about our production capacity and how quickly we could actually deliver homes. We have more certainty around that today. And so, with that, that gives us more visibility around our cash flow. And so, repurchases, dividends, distributions to shareholders are an important part of our of our capital allocation. And so, as we're guiding to $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow with $1.5 billion of that going to share repurchase, another $400 million going to dividends, that's obviously a very important part of our capital allocation. Operator : Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe Jadrosich : I wanted to just follow up on the comments on the lot cost outlook, up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there something that's driving that higher near term? Or is that sort of the run rate we should be expecting as we go into fiscal 2024? Bill Wheat : That is our current run rate. It has been inflecting a bit higher. It reflects several things. Obviously, land prices time over a number of years have increased incrementally. But we've also seen significant inflation in development costs and all that includes in that, whether it's the infrastructure costs themselves along with costs from government permits and regulations and requirements there as well as lengthening the time of development. The development time lines have lengthened dramatically, which then adds to, obviously, the costs associated with it. So there has been pretty strong inflation across really all of our markets on lots getting developed. And there's still a shortage of lots out there in the market for builders as well. And so, that is our current run rate. Whether that's going to accelerate further or whether we might see some moderation over time, I don't think we have visibility to that, but we do still expect to see probably stronger lot cost inflation than our other inflation in our stick and brick costs as we go in 2024. Rafe Jadrosich : On the rental outlook, there are some signs that rents are coming down. And as you mentioned earlier, cost of capital is higher. How do you think about incremental investments in rental in this current rate environment? Is there a level of rates where you pull back? And if demand is weaker, like how do you handle what you've invested there? Like, would you sell at retail or just continue to rent them out? Just how could you handle that in different rate environments? Paul Romanowski : We are watching it closely, and we continue to be in the market with stabilized assets. And we just like \u2013 as we sell homes, we watch the market closely, look at what demand is and what that pricing is. We don't intend to continue to hang on to stuff and significantly increase our balance sheet. So while we're indicating that we may see some choppiness in margins as we flow through this market, but we still feel good about the demand that's out there, we feel good about our position and the platform and intend to continue to grow the platform and be positioned to do so, but we'll watch it closely in the coming quarters and adjust accordingly. Michael Murray : The strategic value of the platform for us to be a very good multifamily developer is significant as a land user. Being a residential developer, we've done that for a long time. And now going into the multifamily development side, we become a better buyer of land parcels and a better partner for land sellers. And so, strategically, it's a business we're going to stay in, going to continue to scale that business, but we will be opportunistic and responsive to market conditions with what we do. Operator : Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade Rahmani : Not sure if this was stated earlier, but could you get the percentage of your buyers that are taking some kind of mortgage buy down or interest rate incentive? And secondly, what percentage are taking the full-term buy down? Paul Romanowski : It's about 60% of our buyers are utilizing some type of rate buy-down and a fair chunk of those \u2013 I don't have specific numbers \u2013 almost all are permanent 30-year buy-down. Jade Rahmani : On the rental business, could you talk to a rough ballpark of exit cap rates that \u2013 or acquisition cap rates that the purchases of your development assets are looking to achieve? Michael Murray : Sort of be across the board. It's going to vary significantly by market and what the interest rate environment was at the time we made the acquisition. So it's hard to pin it down to any one cap rate or even a relevant range. Because like with many expectations over the life of the project, from cost and rental side, there's a lot of actuals prove different than the assumptions we made that come out. And so, fortunately, we've been able to see some really strong execution by the teams and picking good projects and executing well on those projects, and that's showing up in the results. And we're just going to try to keep working in that direction. But it's hard for me to give you a number of what a ballpark cap rate was at the time we did a pro forma on a deal and when we decided to go forward with it. Paul Romanowski : And we have been very conservative in our underwriting and expectations for our single-family rental business and making sure that we feel good about it as a for-sale position as well as a for-rent, and underwriting it to the lowest of those guidelines for our operators, so that we aren't stretching on cap rates that are all driven potentially by interest environment. Operator : And our final question this morning is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Dahl : Congrats, Paul. Congrats, David. I wanted to ask a follow-up about margin, and I appreciate you're not giving full guidance and you're thinking about returns, not margins, but some of the qualitative comments around expectations for maybe a little bit of downward pressure on price, obviously, some potential just mix, outright price pressure, then the added incentives, the lot costs, it sounds like you're bracing for further margin declines beyond 1Q. Is that fair? Or is there any order of magnitude that you can help us with on some of the other moving pieces that you're contemplating around margins beyond 1Q? Jessica Hansen : I probably wouldn't use the word bracing for. We feel like we're in a very strong financial position to weather whatever we find in front of us, whether it's upside or downside. And we're going to do what we always do, which is continue to adjust to market conditions. We're not in a position to give a full-year guide. We likely may never do that again because margin really is a function of market conditions, and we're going to meet the market week in and week out. And we haven't seen the spring yet, which is the biggest driver of our full-year margin and where we land for the year in terms of gross margins, obviously. So as you alluded to, there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of that's going to be dependent on what happens in the spring.  But if we do find ourselves in a market where we have more downward house price pressure, then we'll also be looking to adjust our cost structure at the same time. In a typical downward house price market, we do have the ability to adjust our cost structure, not in perfectly real time, but we're not going to sit there in a vacuum and just reduce home prices and not adjust the other components that go into our business.  So we feel very good. Like I said earlier, where we're starting from, a 25.1% exit rate in Q4 to weather whatever the year looks like and to continue to maximize returns. David Auld : Mike, I'm pretty optimistic. We've never been positioned to execute from a product location, lot supply and have gained efficiency through the last two or three years that I think we'll continue on. So I think 2024 is going to be a good year given a lack of some catastrophic event. So it's just \u2013 ultimately, in this business, it's about who can produce houses the most efficient at the lower cost and drive the best returns. And we have never been positioned as a company to do that better than we are right now. Michael Dahl : No, it's certainly a strong starting point. And then relatedly, just the cash flow strength is also continuing to be unique in this cycle. The $3 billion in cash from homebuilding ops, for the last couple of years, you've had some offsets from the accelerated multifamily or rental operations, some other assets. In the current environment, given what you've already articulated on multifamily, I know you still have a big backlog of under construction, but when we're trying to bridge that cash flow from homebuilding ops down to kind of a true free cash number, anything that we should be thinking about in terms of potential offsets from rentals or other parts of your business? Or do you think the majority of that will actually flow through to free cash? Bill Wheat : As we did comment earlier, our pipeline of multifamily deals is growing, and we expect higher deliveries on multifamily. So I do expect our investments on the multifamily side of rental to show an increase in fiscal 2024. The single-family side, I think, is uncertain as to whether that will grow or not. It's going to \u2013 we're evaluating that in market conditions and where the rate environment is, as Mike and Paul commented earlier, but do expect some offset on the multifamily side. Michael Murray : Within the build-to-rent portfolio, we have a lot of optionality at various points in the development phases of those projects. As we start development, as we plan, vertical product, start construction, and then decide at the point we're ready with homes, do we go to rent or go to lease, go to rent or go to sale on those, so we can respond almost in real time to what the market is and not take a long duration risk on that asset. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul Romanowski : Thanks, Tom. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again in January to share our first quarter results.  I would like to thank David for his leadership, guidance, and support throughout my career. Our company has produced remarkable results during his tenure as CEO, and he has positioned us for continued success. To the D.R. Horton team, thank you for your incredible efforts in fiscal 2023. We are well-positioned heading into the new year, and I look forward to everything we will accomplish together in fiscal 2024. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Holly and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com and we plan to file our 10-Q later this week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the presentations section under News & Events for your reference. Now I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO. Paul J. Romanowski: Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the first quarter the D.R. Horton chain delivered solid results highlighted by earnings of $2.82 per diluted share. Our consolidated pretax income was $1.2 billion on a 6% increase in revenues to $7.7 billion, with a pretax profit margin of 16.1%. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 29% and our return on equity for the same period was 21.8%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 35% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable.  Early signs for the Spring selling season have been encouraging. We will continue to focus on consolidating market share and are well positioned for the Spring with 42,600 homes in inventory and our average construction cycle times returning to more normal levels. We expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 and our ongoing focus on capital efficiency to produce strong home building operating cash flows and consistent returns. Mike? Michael J. Murray: Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 2% to $2.82 per diluted share compared to $2.76 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $947 million on consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues was $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed compared to $6.7 billion on 17,340 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $376,200, down 2% sequentially and down 3% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: Our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 35% to 18,069 homes, and order value increased 38% from the prior year to $6.8 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 19%, down from 21% sequentially and down from 27% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 14% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $375,800, down 2% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter.  To adjust to changing market conditions during fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024, we have increased our use of incentives and reduced home prices and sizes of our home offerings where necessary to provide better affordability to home buyers. Based on current market conditions, mortgage rates, and continued affordability challenges, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near-term. Our sales volumes can be significantly affected by changes in mortgage rates and other economic factors. However, we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 22.9%, down 220 basis points sequentially from the September quarter, 100 basis points of the sequential margin decline related to the decrease in the value of hedging instruments we used to offer below market interest rate financing to our home buyers while the remainder was primarily due to an increase in incentive levels on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down 1.5% in the quarter and lot costs increased 1.5% while stick and brick costs decreased 1%. As Bill mentioned, we expect our incentive levels to remain elevated in the near-term, but with mortgage rates generally declining from the recent highs, we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand and other market conditions during the Spring in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates. Bill? Bill W. Wheat: In the first quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 14% from last year and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.3%, up 50 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year, due primarily to expansion of our operations to support future growth and an increase in equity and stock market-based compensation expense. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul J. Romanowski: We started 19,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 1% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. 28,800 of our homes at December 31st were unsold. 9,000 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 730 had been completed for greater than six months. Our current level of homes in inventory puts us in a strong position for the upcoming Spring selling season. For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times continued to improve and we are essentially back to our historical average of roughly four months from start to complete. We will continue to adjust our homes and inventory and start space based on market conditions and expect our housing inventory terms to improve in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. Mike? Michael J. Murray: Our home building lot position at December 31st consisted of approximately 607,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. 39% of our total owned lots are finished and 52% of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our first quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.4 billion, up 3% sequentially. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion per finished lots, $740 million for land development, and $270 million for land acquisition. Paul? Paul J. Romanowski: In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $31 million of pre-tax income on $195 million of revenues from the sale of 379 single family rental homes and 300 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at December 31st was $3 billion, which consisted of $1.4 billion of single family rental properties and $1.6 billion of multifamily rental properties. We are not providing separate guidance for our rental segment this year due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental closings and revenues in the second quarter to exceed the first quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Forestar, our majority owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $306 million for the first quarter on 3,150 lots sold with pretax income of $51 million. Forestar\u2019s owned and controlled lot position at December 31st was 82,400 lots. 61% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar Forestar had more than $840 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 14.9%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots for the home building industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply, and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike. Michael J. Murray: Financial services earned $66 million of pretax income in the first quarter on $193 million of revenues resulting in a pretax profit margin of 34.3%. During the first quarter essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations, and our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 57% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgages this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 56% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill. Bill W. Wheat: Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible, and opportunistic to support and to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first three months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $153 million. At December 31st, we had $6.4 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.3 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities.  Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.3 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at December 31st was 18.6% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 7.8%. At December 31st, our stockholder's equity was $23.2 billion, and book value per share was $69.70, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December, our return on equity was 21.8%, and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of approximately $100 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. We repurchased 3.3 million shares of common stock for $398 million during the quarter. Jessica. Jessica Hansen : Although volatility in mortgage rates and changes in economic conditions could significantly impact our business, for the second quarter we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 20,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 22.6% to 23.1% and home building SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be in the range of 7.5% to 7.7%. We anticipate a financial services pretax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the second quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 23.5% to 24%.  We are well positioned to continue consolidating market share in all of our operations. Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing, and margins in our home building, rental, financial services, and Forestar businesses will be determined by market conditions and the strength of the Spring selling season in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing pace and price to maximize returns. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.3 billion and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 87,000 to 90,000 homes. We expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We also plan to repurchase approximately $1.5 billion of our common stock to continue reducing our outstanding share count in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million.  Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 of approximately 24%. We remain focused on balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations, pay an increased dividend and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul. Paul J. Romanowski: In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question for today is coming from Steven Kim with Evercore ISI. Stephen Kim : Yeah, thanks very much, guys. Appreciate it, and thanks for all your commentary. I guess, just to start off with, could you clarify, I think you mentioned at the beginning of the call about 100 basis points of the gross margin was affected by hedging related to I think you said rate buy downs. And in your guide for 2Q, can you also just clarify like what -- I thought I heard you said 20,000 to 20,500 closings and $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion in consolidated revenue, just want to make sure I heard those right? Jessica Hansen : Yes, Steve, that's correct. For the second quarter, $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion of consolidated revenues and closing to 20,000 to 20,500 homes. And in terms of home sales gross margin, you're also correct that 100 basis points of the impact was due to the rate buy downs that we've been offering and adjustments we had to make to that position during the quarter on a sequential basis. But what we've guided to for Q2 versus Q1 is relatively flat in terms of a 22.6% to 23.1% gross margin in Q2 versus the 22.9% that we posted this quarter. Stephen Kim : Gotcha. And that 100 basis points, is that something that you have done in the past, is that a number that compares I guess, can you give us some sense of what that number has been over the last couple of quarters? Bill W. Wheat: Steve, this quarter is the first time that, that amount has been significant at all. It is essentially adjusting the valuation of our hedging positions that we have in place to offer our programmatic rate buy downs across the country, and it's typically a very small move either up or down. But this quarter, given the significant volatility in rates during the quarter, of course, mortgage rates moved up to 8% in November and then dropped sharply in December, those hedging positions had to be adjusted to reflect that. So it was an unusual situation this quarter. Generally, we don't plan for any significant move one way or the other. Jessica Hansen : And if you were to exclude that charge, we would have landed in the gross margin that we had guided to for the quarter, that was really the reason that we came in below. Stephen Kim : Gotcha. Okay. That's really helpful. I'm sure there's going to be more questions about the guide, but I wanted to talk about your capital allocation, and in particular, I guess, I know that the mantra for D.R. Horton over the last several years now has been about consistency and predictability and reliability and that sort of thing, and you've done a great job there. But as I think about your overall cash position, it looks like you have sufficient cash. Currently, you've got another $3 billion coming. I think maybe a little less than $2 billion is spoken for with buybacks and dividends, I was curious about that extra $1 million and I'm curious how land investment factors into that and rental. So those are the two of the big pieces it would seem. So I guess, when I look at your land, your land supply has been coming down for -- had been coming down for a number of years, but now for about three years, your land and year supply has been flat. I was wondering, do you think you can bring down that land investment down further or is this kind of the level that you think that we're going to be seeing in the future? And then in rental, can you give us a sense for what you think the growth in the rental inventory may be over the course of the next year? Michael J. Murray: Steve, when we look at our land position, we feel that the forward one year's roughly supply of land that we own is important to maintain the production velocity in our neighborhoods. Bringing that down significantly is going to be incremental because it's going to be with more developers providing finished lots for us versus self-development. And I think we're back up to 76% controlled which is up from where it's been in the past few quarters. So we're going to continue to incrementally look to control more land and acquire lots that are being finished by others, but we will still need to maintain a supply of land on our balance sheet, lots primarily on our balance sheet to feed the production. Stephen Kim : And the rental inventory? Michael J. Murray: And the rental inventory, we'll probably invest in some during fiscal 2024 to grow that platform. It's getting closer to a good sustainable volume that will produce consistent revenues and profits quarter-to-quarter, but it's still in the growth mode. Jessica Hansen : And in terms of the overall capital allocation, as you already alluded to, we did guide to the $1.5 billion of common stock. We've got the annual dividend payments of $400 million. We also have a sizable debt maturity that's very early in fiscal 2025 of $500 million in October. So too early to say what we're going to do with that, and we're very focused on maintaining conservative leverage and we'll see as we get closer, but that is something we're going to be prepared to potentially pay out of cash if we don't feel like the market is right to go refi that. Stephen Kim : Great. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt with BTIG. Carl Reichardt : Good morning, everybody. I want to talk about SG&A for a second. Bill, can you talk about the basis points associated with the incentive comp this quarter? And then you talked about it being also ahead of some growth you're planning. Can you talk a little bit about community count expansion and whether or not this also might be related to some of the new markets you've entered more recently? Thanks. Bill W. Wheat: Sure. Yes. The first factor this quarter, we could point to our 14% increase in our average selling community. So that's obviously a significant increase, and our SG&A is up 14% this quarter year-over-year as well. So that's a bigger move than we have had in a while that's positioning us to be able to provide the increased guidance, and you have seen our market count increase over the last several years. Obviously, we expect in time to achieve some leverage on that. And as we grow our revenues, we would expect our SG&A to come back down to historic levels. But I think we've got a couple of quarters here where we're going to see our SG&A little bit higher as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by that.  This quarter, we have one additional factor and really, it's just a timing factor in terms of the impact of equity and stock-based comp. We typically have an amount that we incurred typically in our second quarter or third quarter, but the timing of some grants this year were a little bit earlier into our first quarter. And so there's an amount of roughly $13 million that it was incurred in Q1 of this quarter that typically would be a Q2 or Q3 event. Carl Reichardt : Okay. That's small. So it's different this year. Okay, thank you for that. And then I have a bigger picture question for Paul. So obviously, the biggest news that we've seen in the business for a while is a large acquisition by an offshore player of a domestic homebuilder. And historically, long ago, Horton was a fairly significant acquirer of public companies and other private companies and still here and there. We've seen you look at some deals. Paul, can you talk a little bit about from your perspective, what do you think -- whether or not acquisitions are something that Horton would consider historically, I know you've done it more recently, you've talked about doing most of your growth greenfield. I'd just like to know, given current conditions where you sit on this sort of big picture? Thanks so much. Paul J. Romanowski: Yes, Carl. We still today look at -- continually look at acquisitions. And for us, we're more interested in the smaller tuck-in builders that may add to our market share in an existing market or give us some entry, but we do always have that opportunity to greenfield those. I don't see on the horizon, a significant large acquisition. Certainly, the acquisition that you're referring to make some sense. We speak to scale a lot in market share, and that makes some sense to us. But today, we're going to continue to look at those as they come available, but no significant shift in what you've seen us do over the last couple of years. Carl Reichardt : Appreciate it, thanks Paul. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from John Lovallo with UBS. John Lovallo : Good morning guys, thank you for taking my questions as well. The first one here is it seems like the first quarter gross margin at least relative to your expectations was impacted by that 100 basis points of hedging that seemingly was not contemplated in the initial guide. So I guess the question is, why would the 2Q gross margin be flattish sequentially if that hit is not expected to repeat and rates have come in a bit? Bill W. Wheat: Well, it starts with -- we sold homes with an increased level of incentives while rates were higher during Q1, and some of those closed in December, but there are still a number of them that will be closing in Q2. And so far on a core basis, we still are entering the quarter a little bit lower margin than what the average presents. And so that's -- but obviously, rates have dropped, and so those incentive costs are a bit lower in the later sales. And so on balance, we expect we should be able to hold margins around the current levels, excluding the hedging going forward. John Lovallo : Okay, got it. And then I think last quarter, lot costs were up 10% or 11% year-over-year, but I think there's some geographic mix that was in there and maybe it normalized to up sort of mid-single digits if you kind of accounted for that mix. I mean, how did lot cost trend in the quarter and how are you thinking about that in 2Q? Jessica Hansen : Pretty similar to what we said last quarter. That was a year-over-year comp. And so we still were up low double digits on a year-over-year basis, and it did continue to have a little bit of geographic mix. But I would say, stripping out geography, our lot cost on a year-over-year basis probably are up high single digit. And until we cycle an entire year, it probably stays that way, and then it would moderate in terms of year-over-year because it's certainly less than that on a sequential basis. Bill W. Wheat: Yes. 1.5% on a sequential basis. John Lovallo : Got it, thank you guys. Operator : Your next question is coming from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Joseph Ahlersmeyer : Hey, good morning everybody. If you are to humor me for maybe a couple more on the gross margin, could you just talk about the actual P&L impact of that charge, whether it was something that hit deductions from revenue or if it was just a hit to COGS? And then similarly, on the -- what you're expecting going forward, I guess it makes sense, you're not expecting it given rates has kind of stabilized but is there a way to think about the sensitivity based on what you've still got out there notionally, like if we had another 50 to 100 basis point drop, would you have another 100 basis point impact from here? Bill W. Wheat: Joe, the charge -- the amount of the charge was $65 million approximately, and that's basically what hit during the quarter. In terms of our position, outstanding. We believe that our position is -- reflects the current market and the valuation adjustment in the December quarter takes care of all of it. There's always some sensitivity. We always have some hedging position outstanding. And so anytime there is a significant sudden change in rates that can leave some exposure there obviously, the opposite side of that is the benefits to the business. When rates drop, obviously, that improves affordability and improves our ability to sell at a price point in the core business. And so what this hedging position allows us to do is offer below market rates on a consistent basis on a broad basis across our business. And like we said, we try to manage that as best as we can, but in a period of significant sudden volatility, there can be some exposure to the position. Michael J. Murray: There were two very significant moves in interest rates in the quarter. They went up significantly in the middle of the quarter, and they came down significantly to the end of the quarter. Kind of a very unique dynamic that we have not experienced. That's what led to the mark-to-market adjustment being more severe than it's been in prior quarters. Jessica Hansen : And that $65 million mark-to-market is in cost of goods sold, whereas the just standard routine interest rate offering does net against revenue and flows through our ASP. But the $65 million specifically is in cost of goods. Joseph Ahlersmeyer : That's all very helpful, thanks for the transparency there. As a follow-up, thinking about the outlook for materials either inflation or deflation can you just speak to what's in your 2Q guide and then maybe just generally, if we're looking at starts rising and your volumes obviously growing, how should we think about the competition for materials perhaps driving inflation again in those? Paul J. Romanowski: Yes, we're seeing some relative flatness in our cost side of the business and would expect to see similar all things stay consistent through the next quarter. Certainly, with the encouraging signs early in to January, it's possible that we see some increase in starts from all of our peers. That could put pressure on labor and on materials, which could cause some headwinds or some increase in the cost side. Joseph Ahlersmeyer : Alright, thanks everybody. Good luck. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Michael Rehaut with J.P. Morgan. Michael Rehaut : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Good morning everyone. I wanted just to circle back for a moment on SG&A and I think, Bill, you talked about the main drivers of the higher or negative leverage, I guess, you could say, being community count and the stock comp. You're going to see a similar type of negative leverage impact on the second quarter. Would you expect that to kind of flatten out everything else equal seems to imply you said that maybe in the first couple of quarters, you're going to see this impact and that should kind of run through by the time you get to the back half or is this more of a 2025 event? And as part of this question, I'm also curious if higher sales incentives outside broker commissions has impacted this at all or if you could remind us if that's the portion that's in the COGS? Bill W. Wheat: Yes, the last part first. Yes, our broker commissions are in and our gross margins are in our cost of goods sold. So that's not part of the equation. And I think your general commentary there is fair. We only provide specific SG&A guidance one quarter out. But generally, our expectation over the longer term is that we would get back to a similar SG&A level as last year and beyond. So I think it is a phenomenon here for a couple of quarters where we're guiding a little bit higher than last year. Michael J. Murray: Little headwind on the community count market growth, but a little tailwind in Q2 on the equity comp position recognizing that in Q1 versus Q2. Bill W. Wheat: And we're also -- also ASP is down year-over-year. And so it's always a little bit more of a headwind on a percentage basis for SG&A when ASPs are down. Michael Rehaut : Right. No, that's fair. That makes sense as well. I appreciate that. Secondly, not to beat a dead horse, but I do -- you kind of made a comment on the gross margins, Bill, and I don't know if you misspoke or it would kind of make sense to us if indeed you did not misspeak. But I think you said at one point, we would expect gross margins to get back to the 1Q levels excluding the hedging impact, that would kind of make sense to us to the extent that in the last couple of months, rates have come down and your current orders would include less expensive rate buy downs than, let's say, a couple of months ago. And I think you were kind of saying 2Q is currently being impacted by some of the carryover from 1Q. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right or how to think about where gross margins are today on orders taken in mid-January, let's say, versus a couple of months ago? Bill W. Wheat: Yes. We provided guidance one quarter out so we've guided to 22.6% to 23.1%. So essentially straddling the GAAP margin that we reported in Q1. Coming into Q2, the closings that we will have early in the quarter are at the -- probably the low end of that range, maybe even a little below that. But then later in the quarter, margins are improving because of the cost of buy downs after rates have dropped is lower. And so -- but on average, that's -- we believe that, that will balance out to a margin in the 22.6% to 23.1% range. What will occur after that we can't really comment. It's really going to be a matter of what\u2019s the strength of the Spring selling season, what does demand look like through the Spring and what happens with mortgage rates. And so -- but on average, that's where we believe things will fall for margins in Q2. Michael Rehaut : Right. So basically, what you're saying is beginning of the quarter at the low end, perhaps a little bit below the low end of that range, that would imply towards the end of the quarter at the higher end or perhaps a little bit above the high end of that range, is that fair? Bill W. Wheat: I think on balance it's going to balance out to 22.6% to 23.1%. Paul J. Romanowski: And we still sell a large portion of our homes inter-quarter. So 35% to 40% is our kind of historical average. And so those are being sold now and as we look through the quarter and into the Spring selling season. So certainly, as the Spring selling season emerges and continues, it's going to give us better visibility as we look towards the end of this quarter in to 3Q. Michael Rehaut : Great, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Truman Patterson with Wolfe Research. Truman Patterson : Hey, good morning everyone. Not to beat a dead horse here, but I just want to understand kind of your old philosophy and some near-term dynamics with rates coming below, a little bit below 7%. I realize there's this hedging noise, but have you all been able to kind of pull back on core incentives, if you will, the past several weeks or is this much more taking kind of a bit of a wait-and-see approach, I think you mentioned a good rebound early in the year, are you taking a wait-and-see approach, so you're not disrupting kind of demand or the momentum ahead of the Spring selling season? Paul J. Romanowski: Truman, I think that as we look at this today, it's still very early. And for us, consistency of activity has been important. So we haven't made any significant changes in our incentives if the market gives this to us, and we continue to see the early encouragement that we are, then we'll respond to the market in kind. If rates continue to stay up, then we'll need to lift our rate offerings like we've done in the past and will fluctuate as those rates move. Still it has been our best incentive is the rate buy down and consistency of rate, consistency of payment to our buyers as they shop in market. Jessica Hansen : And all of that continues to be managed market by market, community by community based on what our local operators are seeing and believe it's the best to drive the strongest returns. I mean, even with a little bit of giveback in our gross margin, our improved cycle times and what we're going to turn this year in terms of inventory is way more important to our bottom line and the returns we're going to generate than giving up a little bit of gross margin and still being at roughly 23%. Truman Patterson : Makes total sense. And with that, you all bumped your closings guidance a little bit to about 89,000 around there. That's well above the prior peak of, we'll call it, 83,000 back in 2022 when there were all of these supply chain issues and constraints. Could you just help us get a little more comfortable with that level of growth kind of based on today's labor pool, a lot availability. I'm really trying to understand constraints today and maybe what level of closings would really create bottlenecks in the construction process, not asking about demand or anything along those lines? Michael J. Murray: We've been very focused on creating a quarter-to-quarter consistent starts plan where we're feeding our neighborhoods with lots that are available in front of us and making sure we have those lots supplied and secured to us. At the same time, we've made a tremendous amount of progress reducing our cycle times and coming back to sort of our historical norms of around four months from starting a home to completion. And so that's giving us much greater flexibility going into this year with the strong finished lot position we currently have, combined with the reduced cycle times, we're able to reduce our homes in inventory and still deliver a closing target that's going to be at or in excess of our two times beginning of the year housing terms. So we really feel good about what's happened there. As to what the upside top side is where the bottlenecks would come in, hard to speculate on where that would be. We feel really good about our lot position, neighborhood by neighborhood and the trade partnerships that we have and the supplier relationships that we have, they've been very supportive of us. Jessica Hansen : But great point, Truman, and that when we think about overall industry constraints, finished lots are going to continue to be an issue in terms of builders being able to put more houses on the ground today. It's not getting any easier to put a finish lot on the ground and so we continue to have a focus on building out our lot position and our relationships with third-party developers to make sure we're positioned for growth. But when we think about the biggest constraints to the industry overall, it definitely starts with finished lots. Truman Patterson : Perfect. Thank you all and good luck in the coming year. Operator : Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Curious if you can provide a little bit of perspective. You talked about favorable trends into the Spring and 56% first time. Just as you look across the business, in terms of where you're seeing relative strength in regards to price points and product where things are above average and where things are below average? Michael J. Murray: I think it's pretty consistent across the board. We're feeling really good across all of our offerings. I mean as 55% to 56% of our deliveries have been to first-time homebuyers, that's generally where we've kind of geared our neighborhoods that we're positioning and the product that we're positioning with that. I think 70% of our deliveries were at $400,000 or less, which for us is maintaining a focus on affordability and a payment that works for people in their monthly budget. Hence, we've used the interest rate buy downs quite a bit. But feel really good. Coming out in January does not make a quarter or a Spring selling season, but we're very encouraged by the early trends in January and are excited for what the spring is going to hold. Eric Bosshard : From a product perspective or price point perspective with lower rates, do you think differently than you did 90 days ago in terms of focus on affordability or do you think about expanding a bit more what you're doing? Paul J. Romanowski: I think we have made adjustments as the market has shifted over the last 12 to 18 months and feel comfortable with our trajectory and the product offering that we have. Certainly, as you look across our communities, they're going to trend inside of the product offering that we have based on rate and monthly payment environment, whether that means that they're buying up in size or down in size. But we feel like we have a good offering across our markets, and we'll continue to stay as we need to respond to a monthly payment and interest rates and provide affordable opportunities across all of our platforms. Eric Bosshard : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Alan Ratner with Zelman & Associates. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. I got some questions on kind of the spec versus build to order dynamic in the industry right now. You guys being a spec builder, I think, had a pretty strong advantage during the pandemic. Obviously, resale inventory was incredibly tight. The extended cycle time as well, I'm sure it was hard to manage from your side. Kind of gave you an advantage versus the BTO guys in terms of the consumer experience. So I guess my question is now that cycle times seem to be improving across the industry, resale inventory is ticking a little bit higher. Are you thinking about that dynamic any differently, are you maybe contemplating selling earlier in the construction process again, whereas before you were maybe waiting for homes to get closer to completion, are you seeing more competition from build-to-order builders that have kind of shrunk in their construction cycle times, any commentary on that would be great? Paul J. Romanowski: I think today, we are still seeing people looking for closing with certainty of close date and in that 30 to 60-day time frame based on their ability to lock in interest rate. And so I don't know that we've seen much significant shift from the build-to-order builders being able to deliver a presale into those time frames. We are very comfortable with our inventory position, both in the total homes and in a completed home scenario. It's continued to play into the shortness of resale inventory across our markets and I don't expect a significant change for us. We're going to continue to stay focused on inventory sales and consistent production community. Michael J. Murray: Even with the decline in existing home sales, they're still three to four times larger of a market transaction volume than new home sales. So we've always tried to position ourselves to compete against those homes rather than just other new home providers. Paul J. Romanowski: The timing of that sale has been able to move up earlier in our stage of construction just because we have gotten back to our historical norms of months of delivery of our houses. Alan Ratner : Got it. But in terms of your sales strategy, I mean, I look at your completed spec count, it's been ticking a little bit higher here more recently. Is that still kind of the strategy to hold these homes off until you're maybe a month or two from completion to allow the buyer to lock in that rate or are you maybe thinking about kind of pulling that forward a little bit? Michael J. Murray: We're allowing -- we're not restricting the sale of homes. Seasonally, you'll see the completed spec inventory, the completed home inventory tick up through the fall and be positioned that we have houses available for quick deliveries beginning in January for the Spring selling season. So we're able to deliver the homes that people are coming in and needing in 30 or 60 days. At the same time, with the compressed cycle times, as Paul mentioned, we are very comfortable selling and locking a rate in for a buyer earlier in the production process than we were a year ago for sure. Alan Ratner : Okay, got you. One last quick one, if I could. Just going back to the charge on the hedge, I just want to better understand this, like we have heard from other builders in the past situations where they would buy kind of forward commitment pools and when rates pull back sharply in a short period of time, those pools would kind of go unused because the market kind of fell below wherever that pool was. Is that kind of what's going on with you guys or are the mechanics of this much different, I'm just trying to wrap my arms around that better? Bill W. Wheat: No, you've described it exactly. We typically will buy those forward commitment pools really for the next few weeks of deliveries essentially is the plan. We're not going out very far, but it is a few weeks and so that's when we say a very sudden sharp change in rates, that can present some exposure there, but it has not occurred in the past, but the circumstances this quarter were pretty unusual in terms of the significance and the suddenness of the rate moves. Jessica Hansen : And it was really restructuring so it could be used, not that we weren't going to fulfill the pool. We just had to restructure it so it was usable. Bill W. Wheat: And then at the end of the quarter, we always have to mark-to-market the value at the end of the quarter. So that's always a factor there as well. Alan Ratner : So it sounds like this is an industry phenomenon, not necessarily an important phenomenon, but obviously, we'll learn more about that in the next few weeks. But I appreciate that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. There was an earlier question on the large builder acquisition we saw last week. I guess we also saw a large acquisition in SFR. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how institutional demand for build-to-rent homes has been trending, maybe relative to earlier expectations. Do you expect that to grow as a portion of your homebuilding operations and just maybe the impact of that business in this kind of rate environment? Michael J. Murray: Certainly we have seen that with the change in the capital markets, that demand environment became much choppier last year. But we still had institutional buyers that were anxious to get the product we were delivering to the market, and they continue to be so. We delivered projects in the first quarter, we expect to deliver more in the second quarter and then throughout the year with the pipeline that's there. I mean, for us, it's a strategy to help us derisk land positions and more rapidly monetize our land portfolio. And so we are still seeing good demand for the product, good demand on the rentals and the lease-ups when we're taking the stabilization process on and continue to expect that to become a growing part of our business. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just last quarter, I think 60% of your buyers took some form of a buy down and you were offering 6.25 on a conventional loan. Just wondering if you can update where that stands coming out of fiscal 1Q and I guess you talked about this earlier a bit but do you think about kind of a rate level where buy-downs maybe stop becoming kind of the chief incentive mechanism or where incentives start to shift back to more kind of traditional ones? Jessica Hansen : We're probably up, call it, roughly 10% sequentially in terms of the take rate on that buy downs. So we were in the 70s and now we'd be in the 80% range of the buyers that utilize our mortgage company. So the 60% you said was on our overall business, so say 60% to roughly 70% of buyers took that this quarter. Paul J. Romanowski: And the use of those rate buy downs is not just new to us over the last 12 months. We've been 24-plus months utilizing that incentive. So I believe on a go-forward basis, staying competitive to not only the new home market, but especially to the resale market for us, and the ability to have a lower monthly payment for same cost of home is advantageous. So we have no plan in the near-term to stop utilizing it even if we see rates shift down. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question is coming from Ken Zener with Seaport Research Partners. Kenneth Zener : Good morning everybody. Paul J. Romanowski: Good morning Ken. Kenneth Zener : I wonder, with the industry, everybody likes to focus on the income statement, right. So the gross margin has obviously been a focus today. However, your initial comments were about inventory returns, which together gets you returns on inventory. So because you took up volume for the year modestly and all we see is one quarter forward guidance, is it fair to say that you guys' internal metrics are generating the same or higher ROI than you had started the year at, I know you kept the $3 billion cash flow the same but I'm just trying to understand we see one part of the business, but not necessarily the output of the other? Bill W. Wheat: Sure, yes. I mean our returns are in line with our plans, and our divisions are out there executing on their plans, their start plans week-to-week, month-to-month and deliver the homes that we expected to this quarter, plus a few hundred more. And so as we enter the Spring, we're continuing with that and very consistent with our expectations from an inventory turn standpoint and a return on our assets, our investments in inventory. Kenneth Zener : Right. So you talked about improving cycle times, obviously, part of that stuff. Do you see -- when you started 20,000, the last three years starts to have been 14,000, 25,000 all over the place. Can you talk to that level, I mean, do you see some degree of maybe use the word seasonality or what's kind of affecting that, is it orders or is it just a plan that you have to reach your closings, A? And then B, what do you expect your inventory units to be at the end of the year given your underlying assumptions right now? Thank you very much. Paul J. Romanowski: Yes, Ken, as you look at our past year plus starts space, it has been inconsistent and a lot of that has been in response to the market, in response to the elongation of cycle times and then further reduction of cycle times. As you look at our inventory today and our guide to basically turn a little more than two times that inventory, we can expect to see consistent and sustainable starts expansion over the next few quarters. We want to maintain the level of inventory that we have and be in a position as we respond to the Spring selling season to stay consistent with our starts, but we do need to grow our starts consistently quarter-to-quarter over the remainder of the year. Bill W. Wheat: And as we consistently look to position ourselves to grow, we would certainly love one position ourselves to grow fiscal 2025 over fiscal 2024. So we would expect our inventory at the end of the year to be a little higher than it was at the start of the year with the expectation of turning it a little more than two times in fiscal 2025. Kenneth Zener : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wanted to talk a bit more about thinking of the competitive dynamics on the ground. As you think about some of the smaller new home markets that you have recently entered and the potential for more existing home turnover to perhaps come through as we move through the year, any thoughts on what those competitive dynamics could mean for you in various markets and perhaps how you're positioned relative to that? Michael J. Murray: I think, Susan, that we're continually looking to provide affordable homes that hit a payment that's going to work in the monthly budget for our buyers. And that is what's oftentimes overlooked, especially by the smaller markets, a lot of the builders that are currently existing have capital constraints on what they're able to build and start. And so they're looking generally to maximize revenue per lot or margin per lot and go with the lower volume. And so they're leaving that first-time homebuyer, that family that needs a more affordable home, kind of not really their target. So that's the target customer we seek out and we see good results when we go into a new market, greenfield a new market and focus on the affordable price points. Susan Maklari : Okay, that's helpful. And then thinking about the cash generation and the balance sheet, what -- as things have normalized, what level of cash, I guess you're comfortable holding on the balance sheet today, and how do you think about the potential for perhaps increasing the buybacks or allocating capital as some of the other growth initiatives that you have out there as you continue to bolster the balance sheet? Bill W. Wheat: Susan, from the size and scale of our business today and the volume that we have in terms of just our constant production of inventory, the cash balance we have on the balance sheet today is in the range of where we'd like to be. So cash across our business segments and the availability under our credit facilities. We would like to maintain the current level and as we scale up over time, we'd incrementally increase that level over time. With our plans this year and our guidance on share repurchase in fiscal 2024, we are increasing our share repurchase by 25% this year from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, and that's just part of our plan to be consistent with our distributions to shareholders as well, increased our dividend this year as well, expect to spend $400 million on dividends this year. And so that is an increase over last year and our plan would be to -- as we continue to scale the business, continue to be able to increase incrementally those repurchases and dividend levels. Susan Maklari : Okay, thank you and good luck. Operator : Your next question for today is coming from Rafe Jadrosich at Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. It is Reese. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the outlook that for an improvement in build cycles in 2024, can you talk about where your build cycles are now where they were last quarter, how much do you think that can improve, and then like what gets you there from a supply chain perspective? Jessica Hansen : We were just over four months this quarter, Reese. And when we think about our historical norm, it really is right at that four months in terms of start to complete, and then there's an additional time from complete to close. That's down from seven months a year ago. So a very substantial improvement in terms of year-over-year basis. Sequentially, it improved by about 10 days. So when we think about further improvements from here, they're not large moved, they're just continued improvements on average. So where hopefully, we can get below four months but that's not something that we expect to drive from 4 to 2. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on the comment that you're seeing encouraging signs as we head into the Spring season. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing, is that better home buyer traffic or conversion, and do you think that's just driven by sort of the headline rate number that's coming down, just want to understand what you're seeing that's encouraging in the market. Michael J. Murray: I think there's lots of reasons people are out looking for houses, but ultimately, they need a house, and we're seeing both good traffic and good convergence early in the Spring. And so we have set up operating plan for the year. And so far, we feel really good about how the market is responding to that. Operator : Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. In terms of the land market, are you seeing a pickup in land development into 2024, I know that you said that things can kind of get a little bit more crunched as the demand increases. How are you thinking about land development costs and lot costs moving higher and kind of offsetting that? Paul J. Romanowski: For us, we are set in terms of our consistent delivery of loss into our starts plan. And so that plan is in place for us as we look 12 months out. We have not seen much reduction in development costs and wouldn't expect with the shortness of lots across the industry that we're going to see, and we're not anticipating much reduction in either the labor side or the supply side, product side of the components that go into developing lots. But we have a plan that we have stuck to and are consistent with, we feel good about our lot position in the near term and as we look next year or two out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And then just kind of switching over to affordability. Aside from rate buy-downs, is there anything else that buyers have been kind of responsive to as far as like the levers that you have to kind of make payment work for them or has there been a type -- any sort of change to those strategies? Michael J. Murray: Product selection, generally, they'll buy a smaller home to make the payment work. And sometimes that's within an existing neighborhood or moving to a different neighborhood that's offering a smaller set of plans. Jessica Hansen : So our square footage was down again about 3% year-over-year. It was relatively flat sequentially, but we would expect just continued gradual moves down from a mix shift perspective in terms of average square footage. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul J. Romanowski: Thank you, Holly. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid first quarter. We're proud to represent you on this call and appreciate all that you do. Operator : This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Tom and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the second quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 23% to $1.5 billion on a 14% increase in revenues to $9.1 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 16.8%. Our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended March 31st was 29.9%, and our return on equity for the same period was 22.2%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, our net sales orders increased 46% for the first quarter and 14% from the prior year quarter as the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remained favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season thus far has been good despite continued affordability challenges. With 45,000 homes in inventory, we are well-positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and our housing inventory turns are improving. We continue to focus on capital efficiency to produce consistent, strong homebuilding operating cash flows and returns. Mike? Michael Murray : Earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 29% to $3.52 per diluted share compared to $2.73 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $1.2 billion on consolidated revenues of $9.1 billion. Our second quarter home sales revenues increased 14% to $8.5 billion on 22,548 homes closed compared to $7.4 billion on 19,664 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $375,500 flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our net sales orders in the second quarter increased 14% to 26,456 homes and order value increased 17% from the prior year to $10.1 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 15%, down from 19% sequentially and 18% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 4% sequentially and up 15% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the second quarter was $380,400, up 1% sequentially and up 2% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability for homebuyers, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Based on current market conditions and mortgage rates, we expect our incentives to remain at these elevated levels in the near term. Our sales continue to be primarily from homes under construction and completed homes and we will continue to start homes and maintain sufficient inventory to meet sales demand and aggregate market share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the second quarter was 23.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially from the December quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and stick and brick costs were both essentially flat in the quarter, while lot costs increased 3%. Our home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2024 will be dependent on the strength of demand during the rest of the spring selling season in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions. For the third quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin to be similar to or slightly better than the second quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the second quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 13% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.2%, down 10 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date homebuilding SG&A was 7.7% of revenues, up 20 basis points from the same period last year due primarily to the expansion of our operations to support growth. We will continue to control our SG&A while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 24,900 homes in the March quarter and ended the quarter with 45,000 homes in inventory, up 3% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially. 27,600 of our homes at March 31st were unsold. 7,300 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 790 had been completed for greater than six months. For homes we closed in the second quarter, our construction cycle time improved slightly from the first quarter and we are back to our historical average of four months from start to complete. We will maintain a sufficient starts pace and homes and inventory to meet demand and continue consolidating market share. Mike? Michael Murray : Our homebuilding lot position at March 31st consisted of approximately 617,000 lots, of which 23% were owned and 77% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 62% were on a lot developed by Forestar or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our second quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.4 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $760 million for land development and $230 million for land acquisition. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In the second quarter, our rental operations generated $33 million of pre-tax income on $371 million of revenues from the sale of 1,109 single-family rental homes and 424 multifamily rental units. Our rental property inventory at March 31st was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.3 billion of single-family rental properties and $1.8 billion of multi-family rental properties. We are not providing separate annual guidance for our rental segment due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of closings caused by interest rate volatility and capital market fluctuations. Based on our current pipeline of projects, we expect our rental revenues in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported revenues of $334 million for the second quarter on 3,289 lots sold with pre-tax income of $59 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at March 31st was 96,100 lots. 60% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $310 million of the finished lots we purchased in the second quarter were from Forestar. Forestar had approximately $800 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 16.4%. Forestar remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next few years with its strong balance sheet, lot supply and relationship with D.R. Horton. Mike? Michael Murray : Financial services earned $78 million of pre-tax income in the second quarter on $226 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 34.6%. During the second quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 80% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 59% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity, which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first six months of the year, our consolidated cash used in operations was $470 million and our homebuilding operations provided $408 million of cash. At March 31st, we had $5.7 billion of consolidated liquidity consisting of $3.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.9 billion with no senior note maturities in fiscal 2024. Our consolidated leverage at March 31st was 20% and consolidated leverage net of cash was 10.8%. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $23.8 billion and book value per share was $72.13, up 19% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31st, our return on equity was 22.2% and our consolidated return on assets was 15.1%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in May. We repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $402 million during the quarter and our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases were $801 million. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : For the third quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 23,500 homes to 24,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 23% to 23.5% and homebuilding SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 30% to 35% in the third quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 24%. Our full year fiscal 2024 revenue, pricing and margins will be affected by market conditions and changes in mortgage rates in addition to our efforts to meet demand by balancing sales pace and price to maximize returns. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36.7 billion to $37.7 billion and expect homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 89,000 to 91,000 homes. We continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our homebuilding operations. We now plan to purchase approximately $1.6 billion of our common stock for the full year in addition to our annual dividend payments of around $400 million. Finally, we now expect an income tax rate for fiscal 2024 in the range of 23.5% to 24%. We are balancing our cash flow utilization priorities to grow our operations, pay an increased dividend and consistently repurchase shares while maintaining strong liquidity and conservative leverage. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We will maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long-term value of the company, which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued focus and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question this morning is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to talk about Florida. It's a pretty important market for you all. The long experience there. We've seen an increase in existing home inventory in some parts of that market and we obviously know higher insurance costs are also coming to bear there. So could you talk a little bit in some detail about your performance there, maybe the various markets within Florida and how it feels to you right now? Paul Romanowski : You know, Carl, Florida still feels good to us. There certainly has been a lot of news tied to the rise in insurance rates and for most of where we sell our homes are off the coast and building new construction allows for some stability in those insurance rates. So haven't seen a significant an increase for the homes in the communities where we sell as you may see reported along the coastal and high wind zones. Still seeing good in migration and good job growth throughout the Florida market. So we feel pretty good about the Florida market and especially about our positioning at the more affordable price points across the Florida Peninsula. Carl Reichardt : Right. Thanks. And then a follow-up on multi-family and single-family for sale, that portfolio business. With some lumpiness there, I'm curious about the markets where you've got fairly good-sized operations in multi-family and single-family rental, one of the reasons for you entering and playing more significantly in that space, I think is scale benefits for the overall homebuilding operations. So if you think about the markets where you're big in those two businesses, are you seeing lower overall vertical costs for the homebuilding operation too or better margins? And maybe sort of expand a little bit on that particular element of the business? Thanks. Paul Romanowski : I think there's two big factors that drive into our push into the rental business. One is, we're a better buyer of land, a better user of land and that we're able to convert more of the land to its ultimate final use. So we're a better counterparty to a lot of sellers as we can deal with the build for rent and multi-family component as well as the residential for sale. That gives us some economies in the purchase of the land and efficiencies in the entitlement process. Certainly within the vertical cost structure, we've probably seen more ability to influence cost on the traditional multi-family side coming over from our homebuilding operations because we're much bigger buyers of parts and pieces that go into the structures than a traditional multi-family developers. Carl Reichardt : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks all. Paul Romanowski : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the market given the stickier than expected CPI. Although rates -- the long-term mortgage rates only moved up by about 35 basis points since pre-CPI. I mean, I guess the question is, have you seen or would you expect to see any impact to demand or would there be any change in your incentive activity given this 35 basis point move in rates? Paul Romanowski : We expect to continue to meet the market and we continue to stay focused on incentives that drive that activity and interest rate buydowns has been a big portion of what we have done. We tend to move with the market. So as you've seen that increase in market rates, we will move up the rate buy downs to be about a point to a point and a half below market. But we do expect incentives to remain near their elevated levels today, especially with the rate instability and stickiness up in that 7% range today. John Lovallo : Understood. And maybe splitting gears slightly here, but you guys beat deliveries versus your outlook in the quarter by about 2,300 units at the midpoint, raised the outlook by about 1,500 units at the midpoint. I mean, was there some pull forward in the second quarter or is there some conservatism in this outlook or maybe the expectation that delivery pace could moderate to some extent? I mean, how should we think about that? Jessica Hansen : Yeah, great question, John. We did go into the quarter with a significant number of completed specs. So we actually sold and closed intra-quarter 54% of our houses. And so that is a very high percentage for us. A typical range would be about 35% to 40% of our homes would be sold and closed within the same quarter. So we still have over 7,000 completed specs. So I do think you'll see that intra-quarter activity stay higher than our historical norms. It may not be at the 54% we saw this quarter. But that did allow for probably a little bit of pull forward of demand, and it gave us the confidence to up the low end of our range by the full 2,000 units that we beat, and then the high end of our range by just 1,000. And we're now back to normal, if not better than our historical inventory turns in terms of what we're guiding to at the high end, it'd be a roughly 2.2 times turn. So feel very good about the ability to take that range up, but don't think there is necessarily an opportunity for the same scale of beat next quarter. John Lovallo : Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen your line is live. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Thanks very much guys. Strong quarter. I appreciate all the guidance thus far. I was curious if you could shed a little bit more light regarding your cash flow guidance. You mentioned about $3 billion from homebuilding specifically, but you do have other segments, you have the rental segment, and you have Forestar in particular. And I was curious as to what kind of an offset should we expect from rental or Forestar this year relative to that $3 billion from homebuilding? And then specifically with rental, you have about $3.1 billion in inventory value right now. Where do you think that's going to go over the next, let's call it, 12 months or so? Bill Wheat : Sure, Steve. On our cash flow guide, we have been guiding to homebuilding cash flow because that has been the primary generator of cash for us over the last couple of years. And we have invested portions of that into the rental operation as well, which feeds to the consolidated cash flow from ops. So there is some offset versus the homebuilding cash flow this year. We're guiding to around $3 billion of homebuilding cash flow. I would expect in the $800 million to $1 billion range, probably offsets that for the full year this year on consolidated. But we do expect that gap to start narrowing in future years as the growth ramp of our rental platform starts to moderate. And so we would expect going forward, our consolidated cash flow and our homebuilding cash flow to be much nearer to the same number beyond fiscal '24. So with the rental platform asset growth moderating, we're at 3.1 today. We do still expect to see that grow a bit further this year and will grow slightly next year, primarily from the multi-family platform. Our multi-family platform continues to grow and we're building out a more elevated level of starts over the last couple of years. But that will probably late '25 start to moderate as well. And so we do see prospects for the cash flow on a consolidated basis to be increasing consistently from here into '24 and into '25. Stephen Kim : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then with respect to uses of cash, I think as always, you talk about the opportunity for growth and your market share across the country, it still leaves some room there. And so I wanted to ask about your community count. You were up 4% month-to-month, up 15% year-over-year. That's an area where a lot of other builders have struggled. And I'm curious if you can provide a little bit of granularity into how much you expect there is further opportunity for growth this year in your community count and what you generally target for the next year or two in terms of community count growth. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Steve. We've been up a double-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis for community count now for several quarters. So we've probably got at least another quarter or so until we've cycled and anniversaried that and would expect the growth to moderate a bit. But as we look at our overall lot position and our positioning for the future to continue to drive growth, we have shifted to a lot of that coming from community count rather than just continuing to have to drive more absorption out of each and every community. So I do think you'll continue to see our community count grow. It just probably won't continue to be at the double-digit percentage year-over-year increase here in a quarter or two. Stephen Kim : Okay. Got you. So like more like kind of like a high single-digit kind of rate is what you're talking about, right? Jessica Hansen : Yes, mid to high. Stephen Kim : Okay, got you. Appreciate it. Thanks very much, guys. Paul Romanowski : Thank you. Stephen. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Please go ahead. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask around start pace going forward. Perhaps we -- assuming we live in this kind of mid to high sevens mortgage rate environment. Is there a scenario where you would dial back production at all to the extent it supports price or margin or maybe said another way, is there a mortgage rate at which you would consider pulling back a little bit on starts? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : I think we're going to manage the starts space at a community-by-community level based upon what we're seeing with buyers in the market and how they're responding to the current interest rate environment and mix of incentives that we're offering. Traditionally, we've had a limiter for the past several periods on lot supply in terms of what we could actually start. So as we're seeing our lots get developed and get brought online, we're able to bring good production starts into the market. I think we started just under 25,000 homes in the quarter. And we probably expect that to continue into the June quarter as if we see continued absorptions and sales. Jessica Hansen : And so with our gross margin currently over 23% and very solid, it would take a pretty big disruption in the market for you to see us have a broad-based across the board pullback in starts. As Mike alluded to, it's going to be just driven on a community-by-community basis like it always is based on our finished lot position and what makes the most sense to maximize returns at that individual community level. So as we see right now, without another big shock or any sort of big shock to the system or a more significant move in rates, I think we would expect our starts to be pretty consistent through the remainder of the year. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Very helpful. Secondly, I wanted to ask around credit and DTI metrics, particularly for your first time buyers. Are you seeing any sort of incremental signs of stress in your mortgage applications just given this affordability backdrop? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : No, we've seen a pretty, pretty solid level of qualified buyer. Our average FICO store this last quarter was still at 725. And with the low level of inventory and available homes to purchase out there, you know, we still see strong buyer demographic and demand and we've remained pretty consistent. We have seen fluctuation in rates, but they've really not been significant enough to have any meaningful impact on our backlog and people's ability to qualify. Matthew Bouley : Great. Thanks, everyone. Jessica Hansen : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to drill down, if possible a little bit on the demand trends over the last couple of months. And I know you don't typically go too far down the rabbit hole in terms of month-to-month, but obviously with the change in rates, with some of the concerns in the market, any kind of January, February, March, April type of progression. We've heard that for example, March -- I'm sorry March and April maybe are a little bit more moderate than what we saw in February. I'd love your take on just how the demand trends, how the sales pace has come in through the door maybe versus your expectations and if incentives in the marketplace have changed at all around that. Bill Wheat : Sure, Mike. We did see at the end of our first fiscal quarter in December, we saw I'd say better than normal seasonality in terms of sales demand and that continued on into January. When we had our call in January, we were still seeing, I'd say, probably a little bit better than normal seasonality into January. And then as we've talked many times, anytime you see a lot of volatility in rates, there is always an adjustment period for buyers. And so we saw more volatility in rates in February and March. And so we saw some intermittent periods where buyers were having to adjust, which does affect weekly sales pace. But then as we look up like over the last six weeks or so, we've seen that stabilize and are seeing a very good sales pace in line with our overall plans and very pleased that, that's position us to increase our guide for the year. Going forward, as Jessica has said a couple of times already, going forward, it's going to be subject to the rate -- what happens in the market with rates, and we're -- in the last week, we've seen another period of volatility. So I think we'll continue to see that the market adjust and we'll adjust to it as the rate environment changes. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks, Bill. Appreciate that. And I guess just maybe along those lines in terms of the impact of higher rates at points, it seems like if you go back to your guidance last quarter, there was a little bit of surprise that maybe the out quarter for gross margins was a little less than people were looking for and it kind of went back to the higher level of rates and incentives seen in three -- in the calendar third quarter. Wondering, obviously, you haven't given guidance for the fourth quarter, but all else equal, if perhaps you're having some of the delayed impact of perhaps higher incentives, perhaps more costly incentives, and I know there's some warehouse buying and delaying of an impact on the incentive front from the mortgage rate buydowns. If we were to stay at these levels just from the standpoint basically of the buydowns being maybe a little more expensive, all else equal, would that impact be more on your fiscal fourth quarter than your third quarter? Jessica Hansen : I think right now, Mike, with the number of homes that we're selling and closing intra-quarter, you're seeing a pretty good real-time average gross margin. And so unlike a lot of other builders, I think you'll see more real-time market conditions show up in our results faster. Hard to say split in hairs between Q3 and Q4, but we were really pleased with where our gross margin came in this quarter. And we actually did see an increase in the number of buyers sequentially that we're able to utilize a mortgage rate buy-down. And in spite of that, we had a slight tick-up in our gross margin. So without giving specific guidance for the remainder of the year because it is going to be dependent on the interest rate environment, it feels pretty good to us right now. Our costs outside of incentives have generally flattened out on the stick and brick side. We're still having some categories go up where we have pressure, but we've had some success getting categories to go down. We obviously do still have some lot cost inflation we would expect to continue to need to be able to offset. So when we think about really predominantly the next two quarters, it is going to be incentive as the wildcard, and it's going to be dependent solely on market conditions. Michael Rehaut : But I think just to make sure we understand then, to the extent that rates have -- rates have risen and the cost of those mortgage rate buydowns become more expensive, you feel like a lot of that is already reflected in 2Q and 3Q? Bill Wheat : I think, again, based on the fact that we are selling more than 50% of our homes intra-quarter, we'll see how that plays out as we look at the next in the third quarter and the fourth. But we move our rates along with the market. And so really it becomes a question of absorption and pace. We're going to continue to manage pace and margin to the returns that we want. And if we need to press a little more on the incentives to keep that pace consistent, we'll do so. But we move our rates along with the market. So it doesn't necessarily mean we're seeing significant cost. In the level of those buydowns, it really just starts to stress the buyer when they climb up into the 7% and if they go to the 8% range, then we'll see a little more challenge in getting buyers qualified. And if it goes that high, I would expect to see our incentives increase to keep our pace. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Jessica Hansen : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from CRC. Eric, your line is live. Please go ahead. Eric Bosshard : Good morning. Two things if I could. First of all, the gross margin in the quarter was a little bit better. What was different that created that? Jessica Hansen : I'm assuming you're talking on a sequential basis? Eric Bosshard : Correct. Jessica Hansen : Yeah, so a little bit of it was just core inclusive of just a very modest pickup on the incentive front in terms of the forward commitments and the interest rate buydown because you'll see when we put out our supplemental guidance, that kind of core margins up about 20 basis points. And then we also had a little bit less of an impact on warranty and litigation this quarter. Those are the two kind of biggest pieces of why there was a sequential increase. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, you talked about it a little bit, but I'm just curious that the effectiveness of the incentives as you moved through the quarter and in the March and April, I suppose. But just trying to figure out the effectiveness in the last comment that was made of as rates moved higher, what do you have to do different with buydowns? I'm just curious how you're seeing a conversion or closing customers behave relative to incentives relative to buydowns and if you indeed are having to do anything different? Paul Romanowski : Currently, we're not doing anything significantly different. We're responding to the rates and the customers that are in front of us at the time. And they are reacting very positively to the incentive offerings that our teams have crafted for the various neighbourhoods we have out there. So no, we're not seeing anything with the current range -- range of rates we've been dealing with right now. We feel like it's sort of -- I won't say business as usual in this crazy volatile world we're in. But right now, we feel pretty steady, pretty good about where things are. Eric Bosshard : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Please go ahead. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much guys for taking my question. You made a lot of progress here in getting back to your historic levels on cycle times. That said, I mean, one thing that I'm thinking here is you're also building a more value engineered house today than perhaps what might have been the case pre-pandemic. So the question really is, is there an opportunity to bring cycle times lower versus that historical trend? Or do you really think kind of four months is the steady-state we should be thinking about longer term? Paul Romanowski : Yes, Sam, we're pleased to be back at what we deem our historical norm, and you bring up a good point, we are building a more efficient house and it's been an extreme focus of us to try and pull labor and man hours out-of-the home to reach affordable and maintain affordability. We're always going to believe there's upside for improvement in our business. And so we continue to stay focused on our inventory turns and the opportunity to reduce cycle times and be more efficient in the construction process where we can. We're going to continue to strive for that. We're not counting on significant reductions from here. We got back to this place and we'll continue to focus on doing everything we can to drive it down further. Sam Reid : Got you. And then maybe to touch on order ASP a little bit. It looks like there was a little bit of a sequential lift between Q1 and Q2. I just would like to hear maybe a bit more context on that number. Was there a function of perhaps you know a little bit of a dial back in incentives in early spring? Or were there any kind of geographic or other mix dynamics that might have also driven that sequential improvement? Thanks. Jessica Hansen : Yeah, it continues to be primarily geographic when you look at our price points. The South Central and the Southeast, which are two of our lower price point markets in terms of average sales price has been a slightly lower percentage of our mix for a couple of quarters now and that continued this quarter. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman and Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hey guys, good morning. Nice quarter and thanks for taking my questions. First, on the resale market, I'm curious some of your thoughts there. We were starting to see inventories ticking up a little bit in some of your markets more meaningfully than others. And when I think about the spec entry-level model, I think you guys have really benefited from the tight resale market over the last few years. I'm just curious, are there any markets now where you're starting to see increased competition from resale, maybe more contingent buyers on your move-up product and just more broadly, how you're viewing kind of the uptick in resale inventory right now? Paul Romanowski : I still think it's a very limited amount of inventory that's available in the marketplace, especially at our price point -- affordable price point. That coupled with some of the interest rate incentives that we're able to offer that for the most part existing home offerings don't provide, we're able to solve the affordability problem a little better than some of the existing home sales would be able to do. But we haven't seen a significant impact on our sales pace to date. Alan Ratner : Great. Appreciate that. And then second, on the NAR settlement with brokers. I know it's still very early, but you guys have been one of the heavier users that were friends to the brokerage community, if you will, over the years. I think you view them as an important tool to bring buyers to your communities. And I'm just curious if you've given any thought to how this settlement might change the economics there, the relationships you have with brokers. And any commentary you can give would be helpful. Paul Romanowski : Yeah, Alan, I mean, we think this is going to take some time to play out. You know we work very closely with the brokerage community, and we'll continue to do so regardless of what direction this takes. I think you are going to see some restructuring, certainly in terms of commissions and it will have some impact, I believe, on the number of realtors that stay active through the market. But we are going to continue to stay close to the realtor community, communicate with them. This is still an emotional buy for people. And we're also going to stay focused on our digital presence and ability to make sure that we are ahead of the curve in terms of reaching customers through whatever form it takes over the next couple of years. Alan Ratner : Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Collin Verron from Jefferies. Colin, your line is live. Please go ahead. Collin Verron : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start on the lot in cost inflation you're seeing. Any thoughts on the magnitude of that through the remainder of the year? I think you said it was tracking in the low-single digits in the most recent quarter. Bill Wheat : Yeah, I think our expectation is we'll continue to see moderate increases, I think that low single-digit percentage continuing is in our current, what we can see in our current pipeline. Collin Verron : That's helpful. And then just on the lots controlled, it's moved up again as you concentrate on that land-light model. I guess how much more runway do you think that there is? And any update on the time line of getting there and just thoughts on the right number of the years of land or lots owned? Bill Wheat : So, I think we continue to look for ways to be more efficient and more capital-efficient in our lot portfolio. 77% is a very controlled number position right now and we're looking at 62% of our deliveries were on lots that were actually developed by third-parties or Forestar. So, we're continuing to expand those relationships and seek opportunities to buy more lots from third-parties. I'm not going to put a ceiling on to how far we can take that, but we've made a lot of progress. And when you've had a lot of success, incremental success takes a lot more work, but that's what we do every day. Collin Verron : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade, your line is live. Please go ahead. Jade Rahmani : Thank you. Are you seeing any changes in terms of investor appetite for single-family rentals and multi-family leaving aside the issue of interest rates? We've seen Blackstone, for example, make a couple of quite large acquisitions, wondering what the tone is from the investors you sell to? Michael Murray : Yeah, I would say we've seen a little bit of a tick up in terms of interest and the number of investors out there in the market. They're still being cautious and rates are where they are and cap rates acting in kind. But I would say that just across the board, we've seen a bit of a tick up and have more interested parties in those assets that we have out for sale today. Jade Rahmani : And a follow-up would be, a lot of these investors are looking for scale in their capital deployment. You've already done some large deals. Are you seeing on average the size of deals you're looking at increase? Michael Murray : Size per community, not necessarily, but there are large appetites to place dollars at scale into this space. Jade Rahmani : Thank you. Michael Murray : There are multiple communities, yes. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live. Please go ahead. Michael Dahl : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on Jade's question on the -- on the rental side, revenue is flat sequentially expected in 3Q, you do have more units completed on, I think both single-family and multi-families. Is that a function of -- if you have to characterize why it's not better, is it more the investor hesitancy at this point or is it the conversations you're having around price don't meet your objectives for margin and return on those projects. Paul Romanowski : You know, it's really a matter of communities, community size and timing of those closings and we're going to be selective through the process, but we have projects that are done and we're going to go ahead and monetize those and put them into the market. Not seeing the margins where we would like to see them, but that's relative, that's just tied to cap rates and interest rates. But no real significant shift that we're going to see in terms of up or down and it's going to be a little lumpy as we look through the quarters because we're selling whole communities at a time. It's not one at a time. Michael Dahl : Got it. Okay. And then shifting gears back to the homebuilding margins. Last fall, when there was a period of significant rate volatility and ultimately rates came down, you had a negative mark-to-market. Jessica, I think you mentioned that lower forward contracts played a role in lower-cost or mark-to-market there played a role in sequential gross margin improvement in fiscal quarter. Can you be more specific around what impact or quantification your forward hedges are having on both the 2Q gross margin? And is that actually a continued sequential benefit in your 3Q guide? Jessica Hansen : No, I mean, we really think about it, Mike, as last quarter was somewhat of an anomaly. We're not going to say one-time. I mean, it could happen again, but it was highly unusual in terms of the rate move going up and down so quickly and the timing in which that happened and then a move close to quarter end. And so this quarter when we say minimal impact, I mean, we've talked about outside of Q1, it's been no more than a plus or minus 10 basis point move from a gross margin perspective. And so, hopefully, that will be the case going forward as well, and you won't see a repeat of what happened in Q1. Michael Dahl : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Please go ahead. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on the material costs. I think, Jessica, you had mentioned that you're seeing some success on seeing some of those move lower. Can you give more detail on what is coming down and how you're thinking about that relative to some of the other areas where there may be some inflation that's coming through? And any thoughts on lumber as well within that? Jessica Hansen : I'll start with lumber and then I'll leave that up and down on other categories to Paul and Mike, they're probably better or worse than I am. Lumber is still less than half what it was at its peak back in March of '22, but it has started to increase since December, which would be kind of a typical seasonal trend. So hopefully, we're not going to be talking about lumber in terms of big swings in our closings. And most of our year-over-year stick and brick decline is still from lumber, but in terms of sequential moves going forward, we expect it to be relatively modest. Michael Murray : Very fair. And I think in terms of the other categories, it's a market-by-market category-by-category, I don't want to say struggle or battle, but it's an ongoing effort to be as efficient as we can do that. And we make some progress on some categories and then we might have to give back some on others. So it's a constant battle, Susan. And we've seen right now, I think some moderation in seeing increases, which has been very helpful in margin right now. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you guided your SG&A to be about 7% for the third quarter, which is still really low in there even as you're making those investments. Can you just talk about the puts and takes into the SG&A as we think about not just the third quarter, but even looking out? Any thoughts there? Bill Wheat : Yeah, sure. So we're continually trying to position ourselves to -- across our footprint to be in position to grow. And as we've gotten larger and have more scale in individual markets, that has involved realigning certain divisions, you're breaking up certain markets into multiple divisions to put ourselves in a position to more deeply penetrate market share in those markets. And the same has applied across our infrastructure across the country as well. And so we're making some of those investments right now and we do see pretty quick payback on that. So that's why our SG&A percentage has remained as low as it has, but we are making those investments that sometimes do have to come a little bit ahead of the growth. But it's primarily in people and in making sure we've got the depth on our teams and we've got the land personnel in various markets in order to be able to tie-up the land positions and develop those relationships with third-party developers and trades to continue to position our platform to support growth. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Good luck. Michael Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Kenneth Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Kenneth, your line is live. Please go ahead. Kenneth Zener : Good morning, everybody. Bill Wheat : Good morning. Paul Romanowski : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Zener : All right. Margin stability up 52% of closings intra-quarter orders. Why was it higher specifically? It looks to be, again, I could make my own narrative, but I want to hear it specifically. And then what was the margin spread between those 52% intra-q versus the ones that were naturally coming out of backlog? Jessica Hansen : I frankly don't think any of us looked at that before the call, but we can take a look and get back to you. It was 54% versus the 52%, just to clarify. And the driver on that was just a function of we went into the quarter with over 9,000 completed specs and our cycle times are back to normal. Kenneth Zener : Okay. So you're getting, yeah, we'll follow-up on the margin backlog versus intra-q, is that correct? Jessica Hansen : Yes. Kenneth Zener : Okay. And then Paul I think you kind of talked about your markets in Florida not being affected by the rise in inventory we're seeing in coastal markets and/or a higher cost of ownership related to insurance. Could we maybe isolate that comment to a place like Central Texas, I think Austin? I know you're building in Buda, not Austin per se. But we are seeing inventory go up in Central Texas, you don't have right the coastal issues. Is this still that you have homes that are affordable and in demand? So you're seeing the same dynamics you talked about there where we're kind of excluding coastal conditions? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : Well, the question and the comment back on Florida was mostly as it relates to insurance and increased costs around that. Inventories, we have certainly seen more inventory in the market today on the resale side than we have in the past. Months of supply has crept up slowly across most of our markets, but majority of what we see coming to the market is still maybe either overpriced or has significant need and work and very minimal in the affordable price points where we tend to compete. So we expect it's going to take significantly more homes to come on before we see to be a lot of impact on our ability to sell. But we've competed in that market forever. We have been a spec builder. We do that to compete in the new-home market as much as we do against the resale market. Feel very good about our product and positioning against the homes that come to market as resale available when they do. And we think we have a great package of incentives, warranty and closing cost basis to compete against that inventory when it does come on and it will at some point in the future. Kenneth Zener : Right. Appreciate it. And I guess, Jessica, you said 3% on land. Could you split that between land you developed and land you're buying finished? Jessica Hansen : I don't think we've quantified that, and I definitely don't have that in front of me. Kenneth Zener : Talk to you guys later. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Please go ahead. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for -- thanks for taking my questions. Just first on the fiscal third quarter gross margin outlook for flat to slightly up. Just how do we think about the assumptions for the stick and brick per square foot, net pricing and land inflation that's baked into that guidance? And then specifically on land inflation, just the lot cost is flat quarter-over-quarter. What are you seeing in terms of land inflation for land that's contracted today? Paul Romanowski : Yeah, Rafe, in our forward guide, we've got relative stability right now in materials and labor. So but we are still seeing some components go up slightly. So I think a very low single-digit percentage increase is generally the expectation there and our lot costs are a little bit higher than that, still low single-digits, but probably more in that 3% to 4% range. And in terms of just new land, that's deal by deal specific, market by market specific. I think in general, we've seen land prices kind of settle out here over the last little while, not as much inflation, but the long-term trend is still up over time. This industry still has a shortage of lot availability. And so I think that's going to continue to be a constrained situation. And so in that situation, we would not expect to see land prices come down. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the further rate buydowns, the forward commitments that you all have, how long do those go out? Are those months, are those weeks? So the recent move in rates, it hasn't impacted the rates that you are offering yet. When will that start to be kind of offered to the homebuyer? Like how long of forward commitment do you have? Bill Wheat : We generally don't go out too terribly far in terms of the volume of forward commitments that we go with. We have various levels based upon anticipated demand of how much we'll buy for a given expiration date, which can vary from 60 days to 90 days out. But we're not going to look to fulfill all of our existing sales expectations with any one given a hedge or any one given build or forward and we'll continually sort of reprice to market so that we're offering incentives that are within as Paul said before, I think a point to a point and a half of market when that is the incentive that we feel is the most effective at driving appropriate pace and margin for the returns at a given community. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Alex, your line is live. Please go ahead. Alex Barron : Yeah, thanks guys and great job in the quarter. Yeah, I was just curious around land development costs. I mean, you guys are developing, I mean using a lot more land options and stuff, but are land development costs expected to impact margin for you guys in the near term or do you feel that's going to be more absorbed by whoever is developing the land for you? Paul Romanowski : Hey, Alex, we haven't seen much reduction in land development costs either from materials or labor. You know, we still have significant demand out there for the labor and those that are putting lots in the ground, not just in what we're doing and other builders are doing, but you have infrastructure improvements throughout the country that are keeping demand up for materials and labor. So that's kind of baked into what we look at in terms of our increase in lot price over time. So we don't -- we'd love to see some reduction, but we don't expect to see it in the near term. Alex Barron : Got it. And I guess you already touched a bit on the rental business, but I was just curious if the margins we saw this quarter, do you expect that's going to be sort of more what they're going to look like in the future or not necessarily? Bill Wheat : It's going to be largely rate dependent in the capital markets as to the execution on those. I think at this point, our expectation is that it's going to be somewhat consistent with where we are today, but there is opportunity for some volatility around that too, especially within quarters within one quarter to the next because these are some chunky transactions. There are large individual transactions. And our multi-family platform is not yet to the scale where they're producing a significant number of multi-family communities delivering every quarter to the marketplace. So there's a relatively small number, they can be chunky and there's opportunity for volatility. Our expectation is somewhere in the range we're in today. Alex Barron : Got it. Okay. Well, good luck. Thanks. Paul Romanowski : Thank you. Bill Wheat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The final question this morning is coming from Jay McCanless from Wedbush. Jay, your line is live. Please go ahead. Jay McCanless : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So on that rental guidance you talked about for 3Q, is that guidance based on projects that already have financing in place? Or is that just the schedule of what you think might close during the quarter? Paul Romanowski : It's a mix of both. Jay McCanless : Okay. And then the other question I had is, I don't want to make too much of this if it's not a big deal, but it does seem like you're going from maybe an aggressive selling pace during the COVID years now to trying to gain market share leadership through more communities. I guess, how far along do you think you are in that transition? And I think kind of to Su's question also, what is that ultimately going to mean for SG&A going forward if you are starting to staff up and bring more people on to support a larger organization? Jessica Hansen : Yeah. I wouldn't say, Jay, that it has anything to do with us trying to push more pace during COVID, it's all tied to our lot position. And so we've been building our lot position up, but not all of those lots were ready to go. And so we knew the communities were coming. And obviously, the market was extremely hot for a period of time. So we were able to drive additional absorption where we had the lots available. We don't have that same kind of strong demand, less affordability challenged environment today. And at the same time, our lots are getting finished and the communities are ready to go. So we're bringing them online and it happens to be good timing that we have the communities ready to go when we're not able to drive incremental absorption further in our existing communities. Jay McCanless : Okay. And I guess how far along do you think you are maybe in the process of trying to get bigger from a community count standpoint? Jessica Hansen : That's going to be an ongoing plan and goal and positioning. And I'd say just watch our lot position and ultimately, the communities are going to come online over time. Now from year-to-year, what exactly is that community count growth going to look like. It's impossible for us to predict. Jay McCanless : Okay. Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Jessica Hansen : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look-forward to speaking with you again to share our third quarter results in July. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid second quarter. We are proud to represent you on this call and appreciate all that you do. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton, America's builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the former presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton\u2019s annual report on Form 10-K and its most recent quarterly report on Form-10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q early next week. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to David Auld, our Executive Chairman. David Auld : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. Before we discuss our results, I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to our Founder, Don Horton, who passed away in May. Don was an incredible man with an unstoppable drive and work ethic that established the foundation and culture of our company. D.R. Horton, the Company would not exist as it does today without Don's tireless pursuit to help as many Americans as possible achieve the dream of home ownership. This simple mission has driven us from the first home that Don built, sold and closed himself more than 45 years ago through the more than 1 million homes our company has provided for families across the country. We are thankful for Don and we and all D.R. Horton employees are beneficiaries of his life's work. Along with our homeowners, customers, contractors, suppliers, land sellers, real estate brokers, and everyone else, Don included, in his family. It is bittersweet to be talking about the company's results publicly for the first time since his passing. Don took great pride in the company's growth, profitability, and shareholder returns, which have been at the top of all public companies in America for the past decade. We will work every day to preserve this legacy and continue to build upon it to improve our operations and the value of our company. We would also like to thank the countless people who contacted us to share their condolences and memories. We received hundreds of messages from employees across the country, and we heard from many industry leaders of other home building companies. Our suppliers, lot developers, bankers, and so many more. On behalf of Don's family and our company, we thank you for the kind words and tributes to a remarkable man. He will be missed. Now I'll turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our president and CEO. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, David, for sharing those words and sentiments about Don on behalf of all of us at D.R. Horton. In addition to David and Jessica, I am pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the third quarter, the D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $4.10 per diluted share, which was an increase of 5% from the prior year quarter. Our consolidated pre-tax income increased 1% to $1.8 billion on a 2% increase in revenues to $10 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 18.1%. During the nine months ended June 30th, we generated $972 million of cash flow from our home building operations and consolidated cash flow of $228 million. Our home building return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended June 30th was 29.5%, and our return on equity for the same period was 21.5%. Although inflation and mortgage interest rates remain elevated, the supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points is still limited and the demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. Homebuyer demand during the spring selling season was good despite continued affordability challenges. With 42,600 homes in inventory and an average selling price of approximately $380,000, we are well positioned to continue consolidating market share. Our average construction cycle times are back to normal and improved from the second quarter, driving additional improvement in our housing inventory turns. We remain focused on enhancing capital efficiency to produce consistent, sustainable returns and to increase our consolidated operating cash flows so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike? Michael Murray : Earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 5% to $4.10 per diluted share compared to $3.90 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the quarter is $1.4 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. Our third quarter home sales revenues increased 6% to $9.2 billion on 24,155 homes closed compared to $8.7 billion on 22,985 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $382,200, up 2% sequentially and up 1% from the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our net sales orders for the third quarter increased 1% from the prior year to just over 23,000 homes and order value was flat at $8.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, up from 15% sequentially and flat with the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 3% sequentially and up 12% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the third quarter was $378,900, which is flat sequentially and down 1% from the prior year quarter. To address affordability, we are still using incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs, and we have reduced the prices and sizes of our homes where necessary. Although our home sales gross margin improved sequentially this quarter, incentives are elevated and we expect them to remain near these levels assuming similar market conditions and no significant changes in mortgage rates. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the third quarter was 24%, up 80 basis points sequentially from the March quarter. Our gross margin was better than expected, primarily due to lower incentive costs than in the second quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were up 2% and stick and brick costs were down 1% in the quarter, while lot costs increased approximately 2.5%. For the fourth quarter, we expect our home sales gross margin to be similar to the third quarter. Further out, our home sales gross margin will continue to be dependent on the strength of new home demand, changes in mortgage rates, and other market conditions. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the third quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 12% from last year, and home building SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.1%, up 40 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. Fiscal year-to-date, homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 30 basis points from the same period last year, due primarily to the expansion of our operations, including new markets and an increased community count. We will continue to control our SG&A, while ensuring that our platform adequately supports our business. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 21,400 homes in the June quarter and ended the quarter with 42,600 homes in inventory, down 3% from a year ago. 26,200 of our homes at June 30th were unsold. 8,800 of our total unsold homes were completed, of which 990 had been completed for more than six months. For homes we closed in the third quarter, our construction cycle times improved slightly from the second quarter, bringing us below our historical average cycle times. Our faster construction and housing terms allow us to manage our homes and inventory more efficiently. We plan to maintain a sufficient start pace and homes in inventory to meet demand, while remaining focused on improving capital efficiency. Mike? Michael Murray : Our home building lot position at June 30th consisted of approximately 630,000 lots, of which, 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third party. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our third quarter home building investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.5 billion. Our investments this quarter consisted of $1.4 billion for finished lots, $750 million for land development and $340 million for land acquisition. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In the third quarter, our rental operations generated $64 million of pre-tax income on $414 million of revenues from the sale of 790 single-family rental homes and 610 multifamily rental units. We continue to operate a merchant-built model, in which we construct purpose-built rental communities and sell them to investors. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home building business by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade labor and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at June 30th was $3.1 billion, which consisted of $1.1 billion of single-family rental properties and $2 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : 4 Star, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $318 million for the third quarter on 3,255 lots sold with pre-tax income of $52 million. 4 Star's owned and controlled lot position at June 30th was 102,100 lots. 63% of 4 Star's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a write-off first offer to D.R. Horton. $270 million of the finished lots we purchased in the third quarter were from 4 Star. 4 Star had approximately $745 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 18.7%. Our strategic relationship with 4 Star is a vital component of our returns-focused business model for our home building and rental operations. For 4 Star's strong, separately capitalized balance sheet, growing operating platform, and lot supply, position them well to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the home building industry, and to aggregate significant market share over the next several years. Mike? Michael Murray : Financial services earned $91 million in pre-tax income in the third quarter on $242 million of revenues, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of 37.7%. During the third quarter, essentially all of our mortgage company's loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations. And our mortgage company handled the financing for 78% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 56% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating loans with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 725 and an average loan to value ratio of 88%. First-time home buyers represented 57% of the closings handled by a mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat Our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined, flexible and opportunistic to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and significant liquidity which provides us with the ability to adjust to changing market conditions. During the first nine months of the year, our consolidated cash provided by operations were $228 million, and our home building operations provided $972 million of cash. At June 30th, we had $5.8 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of cash and $2.8 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.7 billion with $500 million of senior notes maturing in October, which we expect to refinance. Our consolidated leverage at June 30th was 18.8%, and we plan to maintain our leverage around or slightly below 20% over the long term. At June 30th, our stockholders' equity was $24.7 billion, and book value per share was $75.32, up 18% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30th, our return on equity was 21.5% and our consolidated return on assets was 14.8%. During the quarter, we paid cash dividends of $0.30 per share, totaling $99 million. And our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in August. We repurchased 3 million shares of common stock for $441 million during the quarter. Our fiscal year-to-date stock repurchases through June increased by over 60% from the same period last year to $1.2 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from a year ago. Based on our strong financial position and expectation for increased cash flows, our board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization totaling $4 billion. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : For the fourth quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $10 billion to $10.4 billion and homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 24,000 to 24,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the fourth quarter to be around 24%, and home-building SG&A as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 7%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 35% in the fourth quarter, and we expect our quarterly income tax rate to be approximately 24% to 24.3%. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of $36.8 to $37.2 billion and expect homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 90,000 to 90,500 homes. We continue to expect to generate approximately $3 billion of cash flow from our home building operations in fiscal 2024. Finally, we now plan to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock for the full year in addition to annual dividend payments of around $400 million. We plan to provide guidance for fiscal 2025 in October when we report our fourth quarter earnings and after we have completed our annual budgeting process with our operators. We expect to be positioned to increase our market share further next year. We also expect to generate increased cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025, which we plan to utilize to increase our returns to shareholders through proportionately higher share repurchases and dividends. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow, while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation by providing consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John, your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is, absorptions were somewhat worse than normal seasonality I would suggest. I know there's been some noise in normal seasonality over the past few years. But margin was 50 basis points above the high end of your outlook at 24%. So I guess the question is, did you guys focus more on profitability per home versus maintaining the sales pace, maybe as rates rose in April? And along those lines, absorptions tend to decline, call it, 15%, maybe a little bit more percent quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter. How are you thinking about this kind of the seasonality in the fourth quarter? Paul Romanowski : Yes, John. We continue to balance price and pace to drive the returns that we're looking for community by community. We saw choppiness through the quarter in demand as you saw fluctuation in interest rates and we responded accordingly. We did maintain incentives, but didn't lean in too hard and I think that's where you saw the result in the overall sales pace, but still feel good about our position, about the backlog we have, and the opportunity to perform on our guidance for the full year. John Lovallo : Got it. Yes, it was a good outcome. And then maybe the next question is in the Southeast, which obviously encompasses Florida and South Central, which has Texas in it. Orders were a little bit lighter than what we were looking for. And I think when we spoke in the quarter, Paul, it seemed that the pickup in existing home inventory in those markets was characterized as more of a normalization than a glut. I think the thought was that the age of the existing housing stock and the price points just weren't that competitive with DHS product. How are you thinking about existing home inventory in those two markets specifically today? And did higher inventory negatively impact the orders in the quarter? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : I think similar to what we've seen last quarter and through today. Yes, inventory continues to increase, not just in Florida, but across the markets. But we still feel good about our competitive advantage, especially in the price points that we operate in and with the incentive package and opportunity with being able to be flexible on rates. And so, I don't think that some of the flatness in sales that you saw across those regions was significantly impacted by increase in inventory, and we still feel good about the demand, just not as vibrant as it was in prior quarters. John Lovallo : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl, your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Once again, for me, as I expressed to you all privately, my condolences on [DRS] (ph) passing. I'm really very sorry for your loss, and the industry's too. So that said, John took one of my questions, but I wanted to ask about inter-quarter sales and closings. I think it was over 50% last quarter. I'm curious what it is this quarter. And given that you're back to really normalized cycle times and you've got a good amount of inventory heading into Q4 and into next year. What's your guess sort of long term as to sort of the sales closings inter-quarter level is going to be on a go forward basis? Paul Romanowski : I think we've seen with the volatile interest rate environment a choppy traffic pattern. When rates move, the traffic patterns are impacted and we saw that through the quarter. I think we ended the quarter with better traffic patterns, better demand and felt that coming into July. What we would also see is that, people are trying to have interest rate certainty when they're buying a home, and so homes that are closer to completion are more attractive, because they can get into a better interest rate that we can help them with on our [Builder Forward] (ph) program. And at the same time, that means they're buying a little bit later and so we're seeing a high level of homes sold and closed in the same quarter. We're focused on a start space to drive a closings number and the sales are going to occur between those two things. Carl Reichardt : Okay. And then one of the elements you guys have talked about in the past, I think it's still in your deck, is this idea of getting your cash in and out of land deals in 24 months. And I'm kind of curious as you're looking at deals going forward here, obviously, we've seen entitlements, lot development times take longer and longer. Is that still realistic to expect that as you underwrite you're going to see that? And maybe what percentage of your current communities right now have hit that goal of getting your cash in and out within 24 months of those transactions. Thanks, all. Paul Romanowski : Carl, yes, that has been a standard of us on underwriting for several years, and we intend to hold to that. We really aren't looking to own that land until it's shovel ready. So although the entitlement may take longer, we are positioning ourselves in expectation of that time so that we can have properties under contract and/or third party development partners involved to help. And so the more lots that we have, more homes that we're building on lots that were developed by a third-party developer, makes it easier for us to maintain that 24 month cashback. So we don't always hit it. We'd love to say we do. But reality sets in sometimes, but it's absolutely an underwriting standard that we intend to hold on to. Carl Reichardt : Great. Appreciate it, guys. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Yes, thanks very much, guys. Let me also echo what Carl was -- Carl's sentiments about DR. Really a great man, and it was a real pleasure to work with him all those years. I do want to ask about your cash flow commentary, which I found very encouraging, both in terms of the remaining quarter you have this year and then also your intimations about next year. I think you said you were looking to increase -- you expected or hoped to increase free cash flow next year and, obviously, deploy that maybe more towards repurchases and dividends. So just leaning into that a little bit more, your guidance has typically been around home building, operating cash flow where rental and 4 Star have kind of been offsets to that. So your consolidated free cash flow is obviously being a little lower than your -- or meaningfully lower than your home building cash flow. But you said, I think I heard you right, that the rental inventory is going to remain consistent going forward. So does that mean that going forward your home building operating cash flow is going to be much closer to your consolidated? And when you talk about hoping to increase your free cash flow, are you talking home building or you talking -- or can we say, now that's pretty much consolidated free cash flow increasing next year? Michael Murray : Thanks, Steve. Thanks for asking this question. This helps us clarify this. Yes, we are talking about consolidated cash flow. And going forward into fiscal 2025, we would anticipate any future guidance that we provide on cash flow will be based on a consolidated basis. With our rental inventory now flattening out, stabilizing within a range around the current level, we would anticipate that our consolidated cash flow will be much nearer to the home building cash flow level. There won't be as much of an offset from home building cash flow from rental. 4 Star is consolidated in our financials. We would expect them to continue to use cash flow, but just as a reminder, they're totally separately capitalized, so it really doesn't impact the cash flow we have available to utilize for shareholder returns. But with the sharp improvement in our cycle times this past year. Our inventory turns have improved. We expect that improvement to continue into next year. So the efficiency in our home building operation is improving and therefore the cash flow generation from our income should continue to improve. With stabilization and rental, we do expect an increased level of consolidated cash flow next year. And then that's reflected in the increased share repurchase authorization that our board authorized that we'll be utilizing going forward as we expect to see proportionally higher share repurchases and dividends being paid out of that cash flow. Stephen Kim : Well, that all sounds pretty great. So thanks for that. That does also segue very nicely to my next question, which relates to your levels of spec inventory and backlog turns that we can expect. Your guidance for the fourth quarter closings implies a fairly high level of backlog turnover. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for what is a comfortable level of backlog turn that we can expect going forward? Is what we're seeing this year kind of -- can we expect kind of a similar level on a going forward basis? And tied to that, your spec inventory, I think you're running at like 26 total specs per community. Oh, actually, you don't report to the community. Let me put it this way. Whatever your spec levels are per community, where they are today? Is that about what we can expect on a go-forward basis, both on a total basis and on a finished basis? Or if you can give us some color there on terms of what is a target range for finished specs and normal specs and backlog turnover ratio? Jessica Hansen : Sure, that was a lot to unpack Steve, but I'll do my best to answer all of your questions. So on the latter part, there really is no global expectation for number of specs. We run the business as you know, community by community. And so, our operators are adjusting based on their sales environment in each individual community in terms of what they're starting and how many specs they're going to carry based on their sales run rate that they're experiencing. And so they can adjust very quickly to current market conditions in terms of either slowing down or speeding up, assuming we have the finished lot position to do so. So that kind of just rolls up from the bottoms up perspective. We're very comfortable with where we are today. As I think Paul's remarks on the call said, we're selling homes still later in construction. And to one of Mike's earlier points that we -- buyers want a certainty of close. And so, the 60 to 90 days of being able to lock the rate, we're very comfortable with our completed spec position today. And it is allowing us to run at much higher backlog conversion rates than we have historically. We don't really focus on backlog conversion. We focus on turning our houses and not running with an excess supply of completed specs that have been sitting for an extended period of time unsold. And so, that's really our focus is on continuing to turn our houses faster. And as long as those completed specs aren't aged for an extended period of time, we're very comfortable running with the levels we're at today. Stephen Kim : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Mike, your line is live. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I also wanted to express my condolences on the loss of D.R. Obviously, a great leader and visionary for the industry, and he'll be sorely missed. I wanted to start off my first question just on some of the comments you made around, I think earlier you said there was some choppiness during the quarter, obviously, with rates earlier in the quarter being a little higher. At the same time, you talked about incentives maybe being a little less than you expected and that drove the gross margin upside. I was just kind of curious as rates maybe subsided a little bit or came down perhaps to the lower end of their range that we've seen in the last 345 months, if any of that choppiness has subsided? And it appears that maybe incentives are similar as you see them going in 4Q versus 3Q, but if it's had any impact on either incentives or just more broadly demand trends as those rates have come in a little bit in the last month or so. Jessica Hansen : Obviously, any pullback in rates, we would call beneficial, and we would expect to have some relief on the incentive front, as incentives are able to be reduced, or at least the cost of the incentive that we're offering. But we are still balancing that with just overall affordability issues in the market today. And we do continue to experience higher lot costs, which is why our guide for Q4 would be a relatively flat gross margin. Because even if we do have the ability to pull back on incentive costs to some extent, we do have cost pressures particularly on the lot side. Michael Rehaut : Okay. No, that's helpful and makes sense. Also maybe just along this line of questioning, in the prepared remarks you highlighted that you reduced prices and sizes of homes to a degree over, and I don't know if that was specific to the quarter, or just more broadly over the last several quarters. But we'd love to get a little more clarity around that comment, and maybe just more broadly, obviously, we can see the closing ASP and backlog ASP, but just kind of curious, obviously, there's a mix that impacts those numbers. Maybe just give us a sense of percent of homes that you've either lowered or reduced prices, and by how much? By contrast, if there's been a percent of homes or communities that where you've raised prices or sizes and how to think about the ASP for the business going forward into 2025? Michael Murray : Yes, it's a lot there in that question, Mike. So in total, our average house size is down about 2% from a year ago and about flat sequentially. And you're right, that is a mixed reflection of what our operators are choosing to start in a given community and the communities that they're planning to come online. And we might be moving to a few more town home communities to try to meet affordability targets for a given sub-market. With regard to pricing increases or price decreases, that's occurring very much week to week at a community level by our operators as they're gauging their market demand, their inventory conditions, and their future lot supply. So we feel really good about those teams making the right decision, and we really don't aggregate up and say we had 14% of the communities make a price increase, 20% a decrease, everybody else was flat, we just don't look at those numbers at a high level here. We tend to look at are we turning our housing inventory and are we driving returns community by community the best we can. Michael Rehaut : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to the comment around finished spec. I think you were clear that you were intentionally selling homes later in the construction cycle for a lot of obvious reasons. But obviously the number of finished spec did rise sequentially. Your starts did come down sequentially. I'm trying to understand if there is any kind of signal we should take from that around sort of the state of demand and with finished spec being higher, is there an implication to how we should think about margins going forward to the extent you have to clear some of that with either incentives or price? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : Yes, Matthew. I think that some of that, what you've seen is increase in completed specs as we have seen consistent improvement in our cycle times. So those homes are moving through the construction at a faster pace, which means they're reaching completion sooner. So even though we may still be selling those homes later in the construction process, it now allows us to sell them with a closer certainty. So we'll cycle through that. We don't worry a lot about how many of them exactly as a percentage are completed. As Jessica pointed out earlier, it's more focused on are they sitting once they reach completion. So as they age, that tends to be an indicator that we've seen slower absorption or demand community by community. So we're focused on maintaining housing inventory levels that we need in each community. And we're going to moderate that with starts either increase or pullback based on demand, assuming we have lots in front of us that we need to continue the pace that we're looking for. We're very comfortable with the housing inventory that we have. We don't have a buildup of aged inventory and feel good about that going into the fourth quarter. Matthew Bouley : Got it. Okay, that's very clear, Paul. Thanks for that. Secondly, I noticed, you mentioned earlier in the quarter that stick and brick were down -- costs were down sequentially on a per square foot basis. I'm curious as we think about that fourth quarter margin guide of flat sequentially, I mean is the expectation that stick and brick is continuing to come down further into the next quarter? And I guess what specifically in terms of construction costs are you actually able to press down on? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : I think we're looking for effectively flat stick and brick cost. We've gotten a lot of the tailwind out of the lumbered price decreases coming through and I think we're coming to a more consistent level there. The balance of our stick and brick costs, we're probably seeing some pressing for increases, some that we're able to make some progress with in various markets as start have pulled back, people have come looking for work, it may be a little bit sharper pencil coming in trying to get the next neighborhood or the next phase of starts. So we expect some flat stick and brick will probably see an escalation in the lot cost going forward into the fourth quarter. And then, the ultimate margin is going to determine based upon what the concession levels are like in the fourth quarter. And since a significant portion of our closings in the fourth quarter will be sold in that quarter, north of 40%. That will heavily drive the ultimate margin. That's why we felt very comfortable looking at a flat margin environment Q3 to Q4. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thanks, everyone. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman. Alan, your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hey guys. Good morning. And I also share my condolences to you and to D.R.\u2019s family on his passing of the quarter. So thank you for all the great info so far. We've heard from some other builders and also just other consumer facing companies about some deterioration, I guess, in the credit quality of the consumer recently over the last handful of months, we've seen savings rates on the decline. You guys have done a fantastic job keeping your price point low when you walk through all the drivers of that, but I'm just curious if you can provide some insight into what you are seeing from the consumer today in terms of their ability to qualify, funds for down payment, credit card debt, etc. Any color there would be great. Jessica Hansen : Well, with our can rate still being around 18%, we feel very comfortable about the buyers that are making their way into our sales offices and their ability to qualify. A historical cancellation rate for us would be high teens to low 20s. And so we're at the low end actually of a comfortable cancellation rate. On what we closed this quarter, a very strong FICO at 725 I think for the second quarter consistently. The only noticeable difference in terms of the buyers that were ultimately selling and closing to is that their average income has, of course, unfortunately had to continue to rise because of the interest rate environment today. So on a household income basis, we were at roughly, I think it was the first quarter, it rounded up to $100,000. $99.9 is the average household income on the buyers who utilize our mortgage company and closed in a home in the third quarter. And so, that's really the only noticeable difference is that, buyers coming into our sales offices today do have to have higher income to be able to qualify. But in terms of what we're selling and closing, no noticeable deterioration in those credit metrics. Everything has been very stable. Alan Ratner : That's great to hear. Appreciate that, Jessica. And second, a really positive commentary on the cash flow and capital allocation. I think that that's going to certainly excite investors. If I look at your last several years, you've been buying back around 3% of your shares each year, or at least reducing your share count by that amount. Some other builders have been a bit higher than that. It certainly sounds like you're looking to take that a bit higher here. Is there a target you could give us just to think about where that can go on an annualized basis, could you be in the kind of mid to high single digit range? I know you have the authorization in place, but it doesn't really give us a lot of insight into kind of what timing you expect to utilize that. Paul Romanowski : Yes, it does not have an expiration date. Our last authorization was issued in our first quarter, so that one lasted about nine months. Typically, they've been in the 12-month range, but we're not providing specific cash flow or repurchase guidance for 2025 as of yet. As we just commented, we want to go through our budgeting process before we provide that specific guidance. But we do expect that as cash flow does provide a significant increase next year, we will increase our repurchases and dividends proportionately to that. So we do expect it to be a meaningful step up in the level of repurchases. And the reduction in share count will be a function of really where our share price is as well in combination with that, because we're allocating and ultimately we will be in the market, we'll repurchase shares that we're able to get with those dollars. But we would expect the reduction in share count to be greater next year than it has been the last few years. Alan Ratner : Understood. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric, your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. Two things. First of all, to circle back to the choppiness on demand relative to the movement in rates. I'm just curious how much of the orders now are using a rate buy-down? And I guess I would have thought with the rate buy-down prevalence, there'd be less visibility and influence on consumers as a result of that. Can you just help me understand that a little bit better? Jessica Hansen : Yes, we actually saw a slight pick-up in the number of buyers getting the permanent rate buy down, which is the vast majority of what we're offering in the market today. Of the buyers that utilize our mortgage company, it was roughly 77%. I think that translates to about 60% of the overall business, give or take. And that was up slightly from the second quarter and it was up more significantly from a year ago. Paul Romanowski : I think there's a lot of noise in the marketplace when rates were moving and rates were moving up and that affects I think our perspective buyer behavior as to whether or not they're even going to come into the sales office and talk to us. Once they come into the sales office and they understand what's available to them, they might have had an expectation that I got to make a 7% mortgage rate work in my budget and they come in and we're able to put them in something different at a different monthly payment, it opens our eyes up quite a bit to what's possible. And so, the struggle becomes the traffic patterns. If we get the traffic, we're pretty good at conversion, but sometimes all the headline noise on uninterest rates can depress the traffic. Eric Bosshard : And then secondly, if Florida has been an important and successful market, sounds like it continues to be both. Curious if you could just dig a little bit more into for us what's going on there in terms of traffic and price sensitivity and what you're doing or what your communities there are doing in response to that that position of business to continue to grow. Paul Romanowski : Yes, Florida has been an important market to us and we certainly continue to see in migration. People love to live in Florida, want to be there, but affordability is challenged like it is across the country. And so we've seen significant rise in prices in Florida and across the country and with interest rates sticking where they have, it's certainly taxing. And that Jessica spoke to, the real change in buyers is they just need to make a little more to afford homes at a static sales price in a higher interest rate environment. And I think that that's really what we're seeing on the impact of sales in Florida, not so much significant change in traffic and/or basic demand or want. It's a matter of continuing to provide the right house at the right affordable price point that reaches as many people as possible and that's what we continue to strive to do as we position our new communities. Eric Bosshard : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Sam Reid : Awesome, thanks so much. So, wanting to touch on your rental business. One of your bigger competitors is looking to do more in the space, but they're also approaching it from perhaps a less capital intensive standpoint. So first, maybe talk through the implications as more builders enter the rental space or the build to rent space, I guess, I should say. But second, are there opportunities to recapitalize this segment longer term, perhaps run it with more third party capital. It sounds like your rental inventories are right sized for now, but just curious if there's room down the road to rethink the approach to capital structure here? Thanks. Paul Romanowski : Yes, as we continue to grow in this business, we're continually looking at ways to not only capitalize, but how we want to execute in this space. And I think from a single family for rent basis, we've become more efficient with the capital and how we produce and sell these communities. And I think that's some of what you're seeing in our moderation of growth in the inventory levels that we expect to see consistency of the investment level that we have out there. And so we still see strong demand. We still see an under supply and an ability to meet the demand of what's out there. So it's going to maintain, we're going to continue to be focused on it ourselves and be as efficient as we can with that capital. Sam Reid : That's helpful. And then, switching gears to community count, it gives us double digits still in Q3, if I'm not mistaken, and it's really been strong throughout 2024. I believe in the past you've indicated you expect that growth to slow, and I know you're not providing guidance, obviously, for 2025, but curious if there's a level of community account growth that you'll need to sustain next year in order to hit those market share gain aspirations. Thanks. Jessica Hansen : Sure, Sam. And the great thing is, the position of strength we're coming from in terms of --even if we grow sub 10%, we're generally growing the size of a top 10 builder and consolidating share regardless. But I think we have tried to get across the point the last couple of quarters that we do believe going forward more of our growth is going to come from community count. Whereas really for most of this cycle outside of the early years it's been coming from increased absorption. So we do recognize that to continue to grow, we're going to continue to need those increased communities. Some of that's come through our increased market count, which has expanded dramatically over the last several years. And we've still got a hit list of quite a few additional markets to enter into. And we're continuing to work on our finished lot position to where we can get those new flags open sooner. I think what we said last quarter does still hold though. Within the next quarter or two, I think our community count is going to moderate. It won't be up double digit, but I think we're hopeful we can continue to maintain it in at least a mid to maybe high single digit increase for some period of time. And then at some point it may not have to grow to mid to high. It may just be a low to mid. As you already kind of indicated though, it's one of the hardest things for us to talk about and get right, because there's so many moving pieces to either bringing on a new community or closing out one in terms of sales pace. So we don't ever give specific guidance, but that's our best estimate as we sit here today. Sam Reid : Well, thanks so much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony, your line is live. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Can you talk about what lot costs were in the quarter, maybe mix-adjusted? And then, based on the prices for land that you've been buying and expectations for stronger cash in 2025, should we expect a lot cost inflation to maybe kind of normalize a bit in fiscal 2025? Could it kind of go back down to low single digit or mid-single digit or just any thoughts on those lot cost trends? Paul Romanowski : Yes, we have continued to see increase in our lot cost and slight increases as a percentage of overall revenue. We don't expect to see that moderate significantly. I don't know whether that settles in at high singles, low double digits, but we do expect that to be a headwind for us. As the reality of the cost to put a lot on the ground, we just haven't seen much relief in that. And so, we expect to see a continued decline. Jessica Hansen : In terms of the specific, since you asked for that on a per square foot basis, as I said on the call, sequentially we were up about 2.5% on a lot cost basis. Year-over-year we were still up low double digit percentage, which would still have some mixed impact that we've continued to talk to in terms of the South Central and Southeast making up a slightly lower percentage of our closings, and those are generally lower lot cost markets. And to kind of give you another data point, we typically talk about in terms of just the percentage of home sales revenue that our lot cost averages, it generally is in a 20% to 25% range pretty consistently. And we're right in the heart of that range today, even with the increased lot cost we've been experiencing. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. That's very helpful. And then just -- 4 Star is obviously a major source of developed lots for you, but putting aside 4 Star, could you just touch on the kind of the health of your land banking pipeline and partners? Michael Murray : Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily refer to it as a land banking pipeline. I'd refer to it as a lot developers pipeline. It's a large collection of very seasoned, experienced land development companies across the country that have had to -- frankly, they've had to look for some different capital sources and we've been able to help them find some other capital sources as a lot of the regional and community banks have pulled back from that sort of lending, but there's been other capital sources willing to step up when the developer is working for somebody like D.R. Horton, that we've been able to keep those folks in business producing lots for us. And 64% of our closings this quarter came on lots developed by someone else besides D.R. Horton, and that's a great part of our business strategy. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck, your line is live. Buck Horne : Thank you. Good morning. My question is just a quick one on 4 Star and just if there's an update on the longer-term plan for what to do with 4 Star or is there a thought to eventually recapitalize that so that 4 Star could eventually be deconsolidated? Paul Romanowski : Yes, 4 Star is a very important part of our strategy with them being separately capitalized. They are able to support their growth with their own capital sources. And so, it does not have any offset on the cash available for the parent company and our shareholders. And they're growing their platform. And so, we are working alongside them as they grow their platform. They're now in about 60 markets, I believe, so roughly half of the markets that D.R. Horton is in. So they've still got a lot of opportunities to grow that platform. And so, our focus right now is to continue to work with them as they grow, improve their operations, get as efficient as they can at delivering lots to us and to the industry. And then as they mature, they're raising capital. I would expect them to continue to raise capital over time. And so, as that capital structure ultimately matures, then that will give us the visibility to be able to make the determinations on what we do in terms of our investment. And so, obviously, we made an additional investment to buy majority stake and we have not contributed or needed to contribute any additional capital to 4 Star and don't expect that we will need to going forward. But there will be an opportunity at some point down the line to look at their capitalization when they're at a more mature level. Buck Horne : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And quickly on the rental operations, in terms of the current inventory balance, it kind of looks like it's about one-third single-family rental, about two-thirds multifamily. Is that the right mix for how you think the inventory is going to track going forward, or do you think at some point, given the amount of multifamily inventory that's out there right now, do you think it shifts more towards the SFR weighting? Paul Romanowski : I think near-term, our expectation based on the pipeline that we have of deals is the weighting towards multifamilies probably a little bit higher in the near term, the next few quarters. Over the long term, I would expect that to balance out a little bit more than where it is today as FSR picks back up. But near term, probably a little bit heavier multifamily. Buck Horne : Okay. Is like 50-50 the right optimal balance kind of where you'd like to get it to? Paul Romanowski : We don't have a set level necessarily. It's whatever the market demand is and whatever we believe the best mix is for returns community by community across our markets. Buck Horne : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan, your line is live. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is, you mentioned that the cycle times have actually moved below your normalized levels historically. Can you talk about where you saw that improvement come from? And how sustainable do you think that is, especially if we do see a world where perhaps rates come down and activity picks up on a relative basis? Paul Romanowski : Yes, we've seen that mostly from -- we don't really have supply chain challenges. That has largely healed and we have the parts and pieces we need to build. And labor has strengthened. We've seen -- with our consistent production and market scale, we have the labor that we need and job site maintenance and controls and efficiency, just all of that kind of coming together. And that's where you've seen our cycle times drop a little bit below our historical norms. We continue to focus on being more efficient with the construction process and something we're focused on every day. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then perhaps turning to the M&A environment. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing there? Has anything changed in how that pipeline is looking today? Michael Murray : We still prefer small tuck-in acquisitions. We like things that will either expand our footprint in a new and emerging geography, where we can acquire some people along with the lot position in other places. It becomes oftentimes a homes and construction, finished lot [indiscernible]. And then we were able to work with the selling principle to stay in the business as a lot entitler and developer. And that's been a very successful strategy for us in creating a lot development partners around the country as well. Still see good flow of deals to look at, but I would say we're pretty selective on what we're willing to do right now. Susan Maklari : Okay. All right. Thank you for the color, and good luck with everything. Michael Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe, your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and I'll add my condolences on D.R. Just going back to your earlier comments on price and pace and then targeting market share gains for 2025. If I look at your starts in the quarter, they're down -- they're tracking down year-over-year. The census single family starts are up 7% quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter. Your margin was higher though. Has there been a strategy shift at all? Why not incentivize or push orders more at this gross margin level? And then my second question would be, how do we think about the start to pace going forward relative to your plan for market share gains? Paul Romanowski : Yes, no change in strategy, Rafe. We are seeing efficiencies in our operation, which is why you've seen a little lower start pace than maybe might have been expected. But as we continue to move through this market, we're going to have to see some improvement in the overall, or increase, I guess, if you will, in the overall starts pace to keep pace with our growth goals. But it's really just us managing our inventory, making sure we have that we need community by community to hit the price and pace goals that we're looking for. And we'll manage that inventory based on our ability to get those homes moved through the construction process and based on availability of lot, community by community in front of us. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. And then just on the -- for the fourth quarter gross margin guidance, a flat quarter-over-quarter, it sounds like you're expecting net price to be flatish with incentives. You talked about stick and brick being flatish and then land is up. What is -- is there another piece in there that's going to be giving you relief on the cost side, like what's happening with broker, commission, or mix to get to that flat quarter-over-quarter? Paul Romanowski : As we look -- as we're going into the quarter here, obviously, we've had some rate volatility. We did see sequential ASP growth, and so there's probably a little bit of price. We saw a little bit of our cost of our incentives go down sequentially this quarter, so there's probably a little bit of an assumption, a little bit of price, a little bit of incentive cost reduction in the quarter to offset the lot cost increase. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike, your line is live. Michael Dahl : Thanks for squeezing in. Just to follow up on Rafe's question about kind of the price versus pace, sorry to hit it again, but I guess from a more near-term standpoint was the decision to not lean in more heavily on incentives because at the time there was rate volatility, you didn't -- your perception was that there just wouldn't be a sufficient demand response or anything else you can give as far as just during the quarter. It did sound like you kind of made a decision not to push more aggressively. Paul Romanowski : We aren't making that decision here on a broad scale. I wish we were good enough to know which way rates were going to go. But we rely on our operators at a community level to make those decisions based on the traffic volume that they have and the sales demand and the people and buyers that they have in front of them on a daily basis. And I think, overall, what that resulted in is a solid margin for us and sales that seasonally didn't increase maybe like they would, but we're in a good place with the sales pace that we achieved in the quarter and the inventory we have to hit our guidance for the year. Michael Dahl : Got it, got it. Okay. And then on the rental business, just specifically on the fourth quarter, obviously, the last three quarters, it's been a volatile environment to sell either SFR or multifamily. Can you talk more specifically about what your expectations are for fourth quarter for the rental platform? Paul Romanowski : Yes, the rental is baked into our consolidated revenue guide and there is uncertainty around timing of closings of rental deals. So there's a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers, but that's built into the range that we're providing in a revenue guide, but no other specific guidance on the Q4 revenues from rental. Michael Dahl : Okay. All right. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude our Q&A session today. I would like to hand the call back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our fourth quarter results in October. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid third quarter. We are honored to represent you on this call and greatly appreciate all that you do. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call for D.R. Horton America's Builder, the largest builder in the United States. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Tom, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2024 Financial Results. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, both of which are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-K in about three weeks. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our Investor Relations site on the Presentations section under News and Events for your reference. Now, I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The D.R. Horton team produced solid results to finish the year highlighted by consolidated pre-tax income of $1.7 billion on revenues of $10 billion with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $3.92. For the year, earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $14.34 and our consolidated pre-tax income was $6.3 billion on revenues of $36.8 billion, with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.1%. Our homebuilding pre-tax return on inventory for the year was 27.8%, return on equity was 19.9% and return on assets was 13.9%. Our return on assets ranks in the top 25% of all S&P 500 Companies for the past three, five, ten year periods. Our consolidated cash flow from operations for 2024 was $2.2 billion and we returned all of the cash we generated this year to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Our fiscal 2024 share distributions increased by approximately $700 million or 44% from the prior year. Over the past five years, we have generated $9 billion of cash flow from operations, and we have reduced our outstanding share count by 12%. For the quarter, despite continued affordability challenges and competitive market conditions, our net sales orders increased slightly from the prior year. Our sales pace was in-line with normal seasonality from the third to fourth quarter, but below our expectations. While mortgage rates have decreased from their highs earlier this year, many potential homebuyers expect rates to be lower in 2025. We believe that the volatility of rates combined with general uncertainty during the election season is causing some buyers to stay on the sidelines in the near-term. To help spur demand and address affordability, we are continuing to use incentives such as mortgage rate buydowns and we have continued to start and sell more of our smaller floor plans. With 46% of fourth quarter closings, also sold in the same quarter, our sales incentive levels and gross margin are generally representative of current market conditions. We typically experience seasonally slower demand during the fall and our tenured local operators seek to find the right balance of sales pace, pricing and incentives in each community that will best position our returns and inventory levels before we enter the spring. For the full year of fiscal 2025, our homebuilding volume and profit margins will largely be dependent on the strength of the upcoming spring selling season. Overall, the demographics supporting housing demand are favorable and we continue to see a generally limited supply of both new and existing homes at affordable price points, in addition to a limited supply of finished lots available for new home construction. With our focus on affordable product offerings, 37,400 homes in inventory, continued improvement in our construction cycle times and adequate finished lots available in our pipeline, we are well positioned for fiscal 2025. We remain focused on enhancing the capital efficiency of all of our operations to produce consistent, sustainable returns and cash flows, so that we can return more capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Mike? Michael Murray : Earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 12% to $3.92 per diluted share compared to $4.45 per share in the prior year quarter. Earnings for the full year increased 4% to $14.34 per diluted share compared to $13.82 in fiscal 2023. Net income for the quarter decreased 15% to $1.3 billion on consolidated revenues of $10 billion. And for the year, net income increased slightly to $4.8 billion on revenues of 36.8 billion. Our fourth quarter home sales revenues were $8.9 billion on 23,647 homes closed compared to $8.8 billion on 22,928 homes closed in the prior year. Our average closing price for the quarter was $377,600, down 1% both sequentially and from the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our net sales orders in the fourth quarter increased slightly from the prior year quarter to 19,035 homes, and order value decreased 2% to $7.1 billion. The sequential decline in our net sales orders was consistent with the prior year and in-line with normal seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter, but both our home sales and closings this quarter were below our expectations. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 21%, up from 18% sequentially and unchanged from the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was flat sequentially and up 10% from the prior year. The average price of net sales orders in the fourth quarter was $375,400, down 1% sequentially and 2% from the prior year quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the fourth quarter was 23.6%, down 40 basis points sequentially from the June quarter. The decrease in our gross margin from June to September was primarily due to higher incentive costs on homes closed during the quarter. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues were down roughly [1.5%] (ph) sequentially, while stick and brick costs per square foot decreased 1% and lot cost increased 1.5%. We anticipate our incentive levels to increase further on homes closed over the next few months, so we expect our home sales gross margin to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Our incentive levels and home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2025, will be dependent on the strength of demand during the spring selling season, in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the fourth quarter, our home building SG&A expenses increased by 17% from last year. And homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 7.6%, up 100 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year. For the year homebuilding SG&A was 7.5% of revenues, up 40 basis points from fiscal 2023. Our increased SG&A costs in both periods are primarily due to the expansion of our operating platform. Our employee and average community count are both up 10% from a year ago, while our market count increased to 125 markets in 36 states from 118 markets in 33 states. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 18,400 homes in the September quarter and ended the year with 37,400 homes in inventory, down 11% from a year ago and approximately 5,000 homes lower than at the end of June. 25,700 of our total homes at September 30th were unsold. 10,300 of our unsold homes at year end were completed, of which 1,100 had been completed for greater than six months. The increase in unsold completed homes this quarter resulted from a combination of a seasonally slowing sales pace and further improvement in our construction cycle times. For homes we closed in the fourth quarter, our cycle time decreased by almost a week from the third quarter and a month from a year ago. Our improved cycle times position us to turn our housing inventory faster in 2025, and we will continue to manage our homes and inventory and starts pace based on market conditions. Mike? Michael Murray : Our home building lot position at September 30th consisted of approximately 633,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to maximize returns. These relationships allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others. Of the homes we closed during the fourth quarter, 64% were on a lot developed by either 4 Star or a third-party, up from 62% in the prior year quarter. Our capital efficient and flexible lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position. Our fourth quarter home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $2.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was for finished lots, $560 million was for land development, and $170 million was for land acquisition. For the year, our home building investments in lots, land, and development totaled $9.5 billion, up 19% from fiscal 2023. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In the fourth quarter, our rental operations generated $100 million of pre-tax income, $705 million of revenues from the sale of 1,692 single-family rental homes and 868 multi-family rental units. For the full year, our rental operations generated $229 million of pre-tax income on $1.7 billion of revenues from the sale of 3,970 single-family rental homes and 2,202 multifamily rental units. We can continue to operate a merchant-build model in which we construct and sell purpose-built rental communities. Our rental operations provide synergies to our home-building operations by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade, labor, and land parcels. Our rental property inventory at September 30th was $2.9 billion, which consisted of $800 million of single-family rental properties and $2.1 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : 4 Star, our majority-owned residential lot development company, reported revenues of $551 million for the fourth quarter on 5,374 lots sold with pre-tax income of $109 million. For the full year, 4 Star delivered 15,068 lots, generating $1.5 billion of revenues and $270 million of pre-tax income with a pre-tax profit margin of 17.9%. 4 Star's owned and controlled lot position at September 30th was 95,100 lots. 65% of 4 Star's owned lots are under contract with or subject to a write-off first offer to D.R. Horton. $430 million of our finished lots purchased in the fourth quarter were from 4 Star. 4 Star had approximately $860 million of liquidity at year end with a net debt to capital ratio of 12.4%. Our strategic relationship with 4 Star, is a vital component of our returns focused business model. 4 Star's strong, separately capitalized balance sheet, growing operating platform, and lot supply, position them well to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next several years. Mike? Michael Murray : Financial services earn $76 million of pre-tax income in the fourth quarter on $222 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 34.2%. For the year, financial services earned $311 million of pre-tax income on $883 million of revenues with a pre-tax profit margin of 35.3%. During the fourth quarter, essentially all of our mortgage companies loan originations related to homes closed by our home building operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 77% of our buyers. FHA and VA loans accounted for 60% of the mortgage company's volume. Borrowers originating with DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 88%. First time home buyers represented 59% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and balanced to sustain an operating platform that produces consistent returns, growth, and cash flow. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and substantial liquidity, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities. During fiscal 2024, our consolidated cash provided by operations was $2.2 billion and we distributed all of the cash we generated through share repurchases and dividends to enhance shareholder returns. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $561 million. And for the year, we repurchased 12.5 million shares for $1.8 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 3% from the prior year end. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at September 30th was $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we also paid cash dividends of $98 million for a total of $395 million of dividends paid during the year. On September 30th, we had $7.6 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $4.5 billion of cash and $3.1 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. In August, we issued $700 million of senior notes due 2034. Our debt at September 30th totaled $5.9 billion. Subsequent to year end, we repaid $500 million of senior notes at maturity and we have no additional maturities in fiscal 2025. Our consolidated leverage at September 30th was 18.9% and leverage net of cash was 5.2%. We plan to maintain our leverage around 20% over the long-term. At September 30th, our stockholders equity was $25.3 billion and book value per share was $78.12, up 15% from a year ago. For the year, our return on equity was 19.9%, and our return on assets was 13.9%. Based on our strong financial position and cash flow, our board recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 33% to $0.40 per share. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward, our fiscal 2025 business plan was built from the community level up, beginning with our lot position. With a return to more normal seasonality, we expect our results for the full year will largely be dependent on the strength of the spring. As outlined in our press release this morning, for the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.5 billion and homes closed by our home building operations to be in the range of 90,000 to 92,000 homes. We forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2025 of approximately 24.5%. We expect to generate more cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025 than fiscal 2024, and to utilize a substantial portion of our cash flows to enhance shareholder returns. We currently plan to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of our common stock this year, in addition to making annual dividend payments of around $500 million. For our first fiscal quarter, ended December 31st, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion, and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 17,500 to 18,000 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin in the first quarter to be around 22.5% and homebuilding SG&A, as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 8.9%. We anticipate a financial services pre-tax profit margin of around 20% in the first quarter, and we expect our income tax rate for the quarter to be approximately 24.5%. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint, and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce consistent returns, growth, and cash flow while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial flexibility and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and provide consistently high returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors, and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. We look forward to working together to improve our operations and provide home ownership opportunities to more individuals and families during 2025. [concludes] (ph) our prepared to remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Please go ahead. Stephen Kim : Yeah, thanks very much guys. Appreciate the color. I wanted to ask a couple of questions regarding your guide. First of all, I think in particular your revenue guide, can be influenced a lot by rental revenue. And the other factor that you didn't give was also the ASP for closing. So I just wanted to see if you could help us disaggregate a little bit. What are you assuming in terms of rental revenue \u2013 maybe sequentially or year-over-year? However you think is best? I'm thinking about it in revenue dollars, and both for the first quarter and for the full year guide. Bill Wheat : Yes, Steve. Implied in our consolidated revenue guide would be relatively flat rental revenues year-over-year. We would expect those revenues to be weighted a little heavier in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year, and so a little bit lighter in the first quarter as well. In terms of ASP, we are assuming relatively flat ASP with recent trends. Of course, that's going to be subject to market conditions going forward into the spring as well as incentive levels. Stephen Kim : Got you. Okay. That's helpful. All right. And then the second question I wanted to sort of delve a little bit into the -- your comment about market conditions, which I think we all realize it's tough out there. But in particular, you talked about -- how you think that buyers are sort of on the sidelines kind of waiting maybe the election, maybe just affordability. And so I wanted to see if we could disaggregate that. Can you talk about what you are seeing with respect to your interest list or traffic? And can you help us maybe draw a distinction between what you're seeing today versus what you saw in other previous times when buyers kind of went on strike, like maybe the back half of calendar 2022 for example. Just to help us get a better sense of how much of this is actual true unaffordability versus psychological effects causing people to wait on the sidelines? Paul Romanowski : Yes, Steve. It certainly is a combination of both, but we are seeing our buyers sit on the side lines, sit on the fence. A little less motivated today than they were previously in prior quarters. And affordability has been challenged. We still see consistent traffic. It was below our expectations in the quarter. Hence the results in terms of total sales. But still, we were up year-over-year. I\u2019d say, that for the quarter and our sales were in-line with normal seasonality. I don't think this is a structural issue with demand. There is just a lot of noise in the market today. The rate volatility we've seen combined with the election news that's out there, I just think we are seeing people take a pause. But it certainly is a stretch today, and we got to continue to focus on affordability to make sure we get product and monthly payment and position for our people to move forward. Stephen Kim : Just a clarification there. Are you looking for mortgage rates to come down next year? Is that what's embedded in your guide? Paul Romanowski : No, we would expect -- and we aren't going to manage our business around that expectation one way or another. We are going to continue to respond to the market as we go week to week and month to month. Stephen Kim : Got it. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew your line is live. Please go head. Matthew Bouley : Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the questions. So looking at the delivery guide of 90,000 to 92,000 in 2025, and comparing that versus the -- I guess the 37,000 homes in inventory you have at the moment, I guess that ratio is maybe a little bit higher than it typically is and during a year. So is there kind of an expectation for maybe a bigger ramp in starts as you get into the spring? Or are you saying that kind of cycle times have come down to such a degree where you can have that kind of ratio where it is? Thank you. Michael Murray : Matt, I think we are looking at both actually to come into play in 2025. We have seen tremendous improvement in our cycle times over the past year and continuing through the fourth quarter with our lot position that we have, our ability to lean into starts with the market. As we see the market unfold, we'll be able to press into the starts. And we feel really good about our ability to turn that opening housing inventory, what it implies almost 1.5 times in fiscal 2025. Jessica Hansen : Yes. So for the first quarter, our starts probably only stepped up slightly from where they were in Q4, and they are lower than the average for the full year. We would expect it to pick up as we move into the spring. Michael Murray : Right. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then on the topic of building smaller floor plans, apologies if I missed the number. But I guess what was your home size down in Q4? And kind of what is the expectation for home sizes that you're embedding in 2025? And beyond just the numbers, I'm curious if you could just speak about that kind of balance of affordability versus kind of how you think about the efficiency of building smaller homes. So kind of what goes into that decision? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Yes, I'll start with the specifics, and then Paul can give you his commentary on where he thinks we're going. In terms of square footage for the quarter, we were down again both 1% sequentially and year-over-year. And part of that driver is we continue to see attached product, predominantly town-homes, making up a bigger percentage of our closings mix. So we are -- roughly 15% of our closings this quarter were attached product versus detached single-family homes. Paul Romanowski : And we do see efficiency in the smaller plans, and that helps us to position as we enter into the spring market for our ability to deliver. We have purposefully reduced the number of homes we have in the market because of that ability. No significant shift overall, other than we just need to continue to drive to affordable price points and affordable monthly payments. And that comes from a lean towards smaller product. That being said, we still do have our move-up in the freedom buyers that we'll continue to provide what it is that they are looking for in the marketplace. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. Please go ahead. John Lovallo : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions as well. The first one is that I think you described the inventory in the market as generally limited supply of new and existing homes. Just curious if you saw some worsening in that trend as the quarter progressed? And if so, are there particular markets where you are seeing more inventory come online? And how are you feeling about overall conditions in that regard? Paul Romanowski : The overall numbers haven't grown significantly. I think with the low number of sales you are seeing, the month's supply continues to expand. But still at the price points that we compete at, we see limited supply across most of our markets. And with people still -- that lock-in effect still impacting people from the low mortgage rate that they have, we are just not seeing that supply grow in a significant way. We still feel very good about our competitive abilities with new home, ability to offer a more attractive rate. And in markets where there is pressure on insurance, we see a consistent and relatively stable insurance premiums which are our competitive advantage against the resale market. John Lovallo : Understood. And then on the first quarter gross margin outlook of 22.5%, that 110 basis point step down. I think you guys attributed the majority of that to just step up in incentives. Just want to make sure that -- that is the case. And if so, can you just help us with what are your current incentive levels as a percentage of revenue? And where are you expecting those to trend over the next few months? Bill Wheat : Yes, that's right, John. The step down in our guide for margin in Q1 is due to higher incentives. And really, we started seeing those higher level incentives later in Q4. Our margin in the month of September was lower than it was in July and August, and we expect that trend to continue into Q1. And it's based on volatility in rates. Where rates have recently gone, the costs of our interest rate buydowns is increasing, and so that's why we expect our incentive levels to increase further into Q1. On a year-over-year basis, do you have some stats, Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Yes. I'll give you just the buyers that had a rate buydown associated with it. So of the buyers utilizing our mortgage company during the quarter, over 80% had some form of a rate buydown, which was flat sequentially, but it was up from 74% a year ago. And so that equates to 63% of our overall closings in the fourth quarter, which was also relatively flat sequentially. So it is not necessarily an increase in the percentage of buyers utilizing it, it really is just the costs associated with the buydown. And I think with the substantial majority of our closings already being bought down through our mortgage company, that would be the continued expectation is it's just going to be the cost level, not necessarily a significant higher percentage of buyers that would utilize it. John Lovallo : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl your line is live, please go ahead. Carl Reichardt : Thanks everybody. Just one two-parter. Can you talk at all about any impact from hurricanes on ops traffic, the communities themselves? And then has there been any positive or negative impact given your reliance on buyers' brokers? It's a big focus for you has been for a long time. Any impact from the settlement to driving traffic sales rates at all or cost? Michael Murray : Yeah, Carl, I'll take the first part of that question. First of all the hurricanes, just horrified as everyone else was with the impact that had on so many families across those regions. Fortunately, the D.R. Horton family, our employees and our homeowners, fared very well in those storms. We did not have a significant impact on our communities. Thankfully, with the current building codes we build to, we see those communities perform very well in adverse weather events. At the same time, you see the crews responding, utility crews and municipalities focus is diverted to restoring services to residents and rightly so, that can slow down power, electrification for us, it can slow down inspections and some of that processing. But it becomes a timing issue rather than any kind of a permanent effect on the business. So we feel very fortunate as D.R. Horton [or] (ph) the D.R. Horton family got through these storms pretty well. Paul Romanowski : As far as the NAR settlement and realtor community response, they seem to have been handling it well. They are largely adjusting to what they need to do to satisfy the requirements of the NAR settlements. I haven't seen much of a significant shift one way or the other in terms of traffic, and/or much change in broker commissions. I think that will play out over time. But again, with the limited number of homes generally available across the market, we still have our realtors that have been consistent in their performance with us, still showing up in our sales office and able to navigate the requirements of the settlement. Carl Reichardt : All right. Thanks for that. And then you talked to employee and average store count up quite a bit in fiscal '24. As you are looking at '25, what are your expectations for what we might see in terms of a flattening of that store count growth or a slowdown in the number of new markets you you'd add so that we might get better SG&A leverage next year? Or do you expect to continue to grow those pretty aggressively? Thanks. Bill Wheat : Yes. Clearly, we have been making an investment in these new markets to prepare for some growth. And as we grow into that, I would expect those growth rates to moderate a bit. The community count growth has been near double-digit, high single to low double for the last year or so. And so naturally, we'd expect that to start to moderate back towards the mid-single-digit level as well. So yes, we always want to make sure to control our SG&A, but we have been making some investments here recently, that we do expect will support a higher growth level going forward. Carl Reichardt : Okay, thanks Bill. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Please go ahead. Sam Reid : Thank you so much. So it sounds like gross margin moved lower intra-quarter, September versus July, August. And then as you look to your guidance for the fourth quarter, that 22.5%, kind of is that 22.5% in-line with the exit rate from the last quarter? Or does it imply that November or December will be below October levels? Jessica Hansen : Yes. Great question, Sam. It is incorporated in our guide that our September month of closings was our lowest gross margin in the quarter. Not quite to where we expect to be for the full year of Q1 because as we said, we do expect to have further increases in incentive costs, but not far off from where we were in the September month. Sam Reid : Got you. And then I wanted to touch on your completed unsold inventories around 10,300. Just wanted to see if there was any details specifically on geographic dispersion, whether you are seeing a concentration of completed unsold inventories in some of the focus markets that investors are interested in, like Florida and Texas? Thanks. Paul Romanowski : No. No geographic sensitivity or a place where we've seen those units stack up across the Board and across our footprint. We've seen improvement in our cycle times. And sales being slightly below our expectations in the quarter is why we've seen that increase in completed inventory. We still are not seeing it sit around and age, and that's when we start to get concerned. We do expect that our completed inventory over the next few quarters, we'll start to trend back down. As we've hit the sales pace we need community-backed community and have adjusted starts where we needed to. But we have the homes we are comfortable with today, and we need to adjust that completed number down over the next few quarters. Sam Reid : Great. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll pause it on. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is live. Please go ahead. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Appreciate you taking my questions. I want to delve a little bit into regional color, if possible. And apologies if I missed this earlier. But with all the focus on Florida and Texas obviously, and around inventory levels, I know that you've kind of stated a couple of times that you feel like that, that perhaps on a broad base is not an issue. But just trying to get a sense, when you think about particularly the guide kind of flat to up low single digits for closings, does that reflect any regional challenges? Or maybe just more broadly, if you can kind of give us a sense of where you feel demand is stronger versus weaker across your footprint? Michael Murray : I don't think the guide is reflecting any concern with a given region. The biggest markets that we've been in, Florida and Texas, are also very competitive markets. And so as the buyers have taken a pause that's been reflective I think, across the footprint in those markets. And looking forward into the guide and expectations for next year, that was built largely on the basis of available lots that we have -- that we have a comfort level around starts pace, that we'll lean into as we see spring unfolds. And we have the capacity to adjust that starts pace reflective of the spring selling conditions. Michael Rehaut : Okay. I appreciate that. I guess secondly, you mentioned that throughout the quarter, September was your lower margin month with higher incentives. I was curious -- and again, apologies if I missed this earlier, but wanted to get a sense just from a demand and order growth standpoint, sales pace standpoint. We've heard some of your competitors talk to September being the strongest month of the quarter. And I was just kind of wondering if that's what you saw from a sales pace or an order growth standpoint. Obviously, rates fluctuated a lot during the quarter, but there was perhaps that points into September -- August, September, a little bit of a lower point from a rate standpoint. So just kind of curious on what you saw, how things trended during the quarter and where September was relative to the rest? Michael Murray : I think we saw a pretty choppy sales environment through the quarter. If we look at the chart of the mortgage rates. We started the quarter just under 7%. We ended the quarter just above 6%, and it is a pretty smooth trajectory down. And I think that affected a lot of buyers' psyche and thinking about, wow, the rates are on a good trend. I'm going to keep riding that trend before I jump in. And then lo and behold, we saw October turnaround after the Fed cuts and rates are up 50 basis points in the month of October. So it is kind of crazy predicting interest rates. So hard to see any discernible trend, other than we saw some choppy sales and a buyer that was on pause. Jessica Hansen : And still have through the month of October to date, just continued rate volatility. Michael Rehaut : Okay, very good. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan, your line is live. Please go ahead. Alan Ratner : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for the time and info so far. My question, I guess, relates to just the broader strategy that you've had, as long as we've been covering Horton, which is to consolidate market share. And I guess what I'm thinking about is you've heard from several other of your larger peers, a goal or a target to grow in '25 by a 5% to 10% rate on closings, orders, whatever the metrics they are looking at. And your guide is obviously a bit below that in '25. And I know it is preliminary and I know it can obviously move around based on how the spring unfolds. But on the surface right now, it would look like, at least in the near term, you don't expect to be taking a significant amount of market share. So I'm curious when you think about that outlook, is that a function of you see maybe some more aggressive incentives out in the market from some of your competitors, that you don't feel the need or the desire to match right now to do what you need to do to actually take share? Do you think that some of the guys out there might prove to be too aggressive? Is it a function of a price point differential, maybe stronger activity at higher price points? Just curious if you can kind of talk about the competitive dynamics that would seemingly set you guys up for a year of no meaningful share growth. Paul Romanowski : All right. Alan, we do feel very good our position. We are still well ahead of the spring selling season. We do have the lot position. We have the inventory and cycle time improvement that we need to lean into the market if we see a stronger market in the spring. Our operators are always going to have a higher goal than the numbers that we're reaching to, and it's not a significant shift other than a guide as best we see it today. And we are going to stay positioned to respond to the market. We feel great about our position and great about our operators in the field and their ability to gauge the market and lean in should it show up stronger in the spring. Alan Ratner : Got it. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then second question is kind of around the spec strategy. I know, obviously, you and others have pivoted to kind of 100% spec models over the course of the last several years, somewhat out of necessity given the supply chain somewhat out of -- that's where the demand was given the tight resale market? But we've talked about this in the past where even though you never were a huge build-to-order builder by any stretch of the imagination, that was always at least some portion of your business. And I'm curious now with kind of where your spec position is, where your backlog is. Is there any thought of maybe kind of returning to some extent to the build-to-order market, especially if the demand in the spring turns out to be shown signs of acceleration? Michael Murray : I wouldn't -- see change shift in our strategy, it\u2019s a kind of a community by community, since we are past the supply chain challenges. We've driven a lot of efficiency into the building process and cycle times. We will allow our local operators to make those decisions community by community about going to more of a presale focus depending upon the customer segment that they're seeking to serve with that particular community and what the market conditions are like. I mean we still see tremendous demand, especially for the first-time homebuyer with the house that can close in 60 days, get them qualified for the mortgage and in-line with when a lease or something may be expiring. Alan Ratner : Make sense. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Eric your line is live. Please go ahead. Eric Bosshard : Thanks. Two things, if I could. The increased incentive spender costs, just for a little more clarity, is this you investing more lowering the cost for your customers and is that the strategy? Or is this just it's gotten -- the cost of it's gotten more expensive as rates ticked back higher? Just where we are and what the strategy or vision for that is? Paul Romanowski : It is our expectation. We need to increase our incentives and stay where they are lean in a little more based on rates and achieving affordability for our buyers. So then if want to maintain a bigger spread off of market rates. That's going to cost a little more. But as we look forward into the next quarter, we expect that our incentives will have to remain elevated in order to maintain affordability and monthly payments that our buyers are looking for. Bill Wheat : And then, Eric when rates are volatile or more uncertain, the cost of those incentives do increase. And so regardless of where the level is or how much we're choosing to buy during those periods where it's more uncertain, the cost is just higher. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then second question which is lately potentially redundant, I'll ask it nonetheless. But you talked about this phenomenon of affordability challenges. Your solution for affordability challenges incentives, a bit more smaller homes. Is there anything beyond that or incremental to that as you look at one of the key limiting factors is this phenomenon of affordability? Any other solutions that you see that you can help address that to unlock more demand? Michael Murray : We are continually evaluating the product selection that are going into the homes and looking to see where it makes sense to hit the affordability numbers. Neighborhood location can have a lot to do with ultimate affordability as to cost of the underlying dirt, cost of development requirements and what municipalities are asking for, whether it is in horizontal improvements or the homes themselves. And so continually looking for ways to bring houses people can afford in the market. And it's a combination of everything. It's not one thing that we do. It's something we try to get to do every day and be as efficient as possible with our starts program, to work with our trade partners and labor to make sure that they're able to plan a business and share those savings of a planful business with us that we can pass along to our shareholders. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Paul Przybylski from Wolfe Research. Paul your line is live. Please go ahead. Paul Przybylski : Thank you. Your can rate increased a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering, are accelerating incentives create any issues with backlog right now? And historically, down payments have been the greatest impediment for the entry level buyer. Is that still the case? Or has that shifted more to DTI or monthly payment constraint? Jessica Hansen : I think we haven't seen a big change in the buyer profile. Obviously, we've harped on affordability being an issue that hasn't changed. So it does take a little bit more household income to qualify for a home today than it did several years ago. But our can rate was in-line with a year ago and typically we do see a slight tick-up in the fourth quarter for various reasons. And if you look at our cadence intra-quarter and Q4 on our can rate, it was very consistent with last year's Q4. And low -- high double-digit to low 20s is a very comfortable rate for us to manage. Paul Przybylski : Okay. I was wondering, what was your average 4Q rate promotion? How that compared to 3Q? And what is it so far in October? Paul Romanowski : Yes. We are really in the 4.5% to 5.5% in terms of our offerings that are out there. Rates have moved up in the last few weeks. We'll see where they settle in over the next couple. That may drift up, but still staying in that 1% to 1.5% kind of below market rates is where we have maintained this past quarter end, and the prior couple of quarters. Jessica Hansen : Yes. Our backlog is right in the middle of that, it's at 5.2%. Paul Przybylski : Great. Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony your line is live. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. You had pretty favorable stick and brick costs in the quarter, and I was just wondering how you saw those trending in fiscal 1Q. And then I think referencing maybe John's question, is it fair to say stick and brick is not really driving a big move in margins quarter-over-quarter in terms of that step down? Jessica Hansen : Yes. That's very fair. I think we've said for a couple of quarters, we expect the benefit of lumber to be behind us, but that was still a benefit in the closings this quarter. Our stick and brick costs were down roughly 1% sequentially and about 2.5% year-over-year. And I think our base case as we move throughout '25, is we'd see relatively flat, give or take a percent, on the stick and brick side. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. Got it. And I'm just curious, I mean with the election coming up, are there one or two issues that you could see impacting the industry from a builder perspective or buyers that you'll be really watching as we see kind of how it plays out? Michael Murray : I think everybody would be happy the election is over. I think that will help buyer sentiment and the ability to move forward with their life decision. Anthony Pettinari : Sounds good. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken, your line is live. Please go ahead. Ken Zener : Good morning everybody. Can you hear me? Jessica Hansen : Yes, go ahead. Ken Zener : I just want to check. Thank you. All right. Obviously, not what the Street or probably what you all were expecting. But I just want to go through a few basic thoughts here. First, do you think part of the -- I mean, look, price is high. We can see that in affordability. Therefore, you're using incentives, which makes sense. But do you think part of the issue is on the slowing supply given the whole narrative of tight supply in terms of under construction? Is that in most markets, because the builders are so dominant that new homebuyers already have been in a rate-neutral environment because most new builders are offering incentives? That seems to me that you might have pulled forward demand given that we are -- you still have these incentives. Or do you think it's strictly an issue of affordability therefore, that affects your long-term view on gross margins? Paul Romanowski : I do think that the lock-in -- the fact that we don't have a lot of resale homes in the market also means that we don't have those buyers coming in when they sell their house coming into our offices. 45% of our buyers are not first-time homebuyers. Although we sell more than 50% too. Those means they need to move on from their existing home. I don't think there is a lack of want, it's -- or need going out there. So we could be building some pent-up demand. And so we aren't that concerned if we see resale inventory start to rise a little bit because that means people are moving around more, and that's going to provide more buyers into our offices. We are certainly competitive with the resale market today. We do hear that from our realtors, that because of our rate buydowns and availability that we have of house, at more affordable price points, that it's challenged to the resale market. Ken Zener : And do you want to comment, I think at some point over the last couple of years, you talked about structurally higher gross margins in contrast to what had been a 19% or 20% time -- under prior management. But do you still have confidence that your -- the gross margins can be structurally higher for you guys? Or do you perhaps have the view that at current rates, the affordability is actually a bigger issue given the persistency of these incentives? Thank you. Jessica Hansen : Ken, we've always said that we're going to do what we need to do to maximize returns. And so for periods of time, we could see gross margin compression. But over the long-term, I do think, on average, we believe there is reasons that the long-term average gross margin could be structurally higher because of the scale advantages in the business and our lower cost of capital from the deleveraging we've done. But we're going to meet the market quarter to quarter to quarter. And if that means compressing margins in the short-term to maximize returns, that's the approach we're going to take. Bill Wheat : And to the longer-term view, we are talking about a step-down in margin to 22.5%, which is above the high-end of our historic range of margins. So we have been at a higher level. And -- but we are going to meet the market, and there will be periods of times where we need to. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe your line is live. Please go ahead. Rafe Jadrosich : Hi, good morning thanks for taking my questions. You spoke about the stick and brick inflation that you are expecting. Can you talk about what you're anticipating for land inflation in the first quarter and then through 2025? Jessica Hansen : So we've seen a little bit of a moderation from low double-digit percentage increase in our lot cost to high single digit this quarter. On a full year basis, we were up a double-digit percentage. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, it was a high single. So I think we expect to continue to have cost inflation as we move throughout 2025 that maybe it can moderate to a mid-single digit as we get a couple of quarters past and have cycled through some of those comparisons already. But our base case is that lot costs will continue to increase at least a mid-single-digit percentage. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay. That's really helpful. And then just putting that all kind of together, how do we think of what level of net price you would need in fiscal '25 to hold margins? Bill Wheat : We would need a small amount. With the lot cost at the mid-to-high impact on overall price, you need a small amount but not a significant amount because we do expect our stick and brick costs to remain relatively flat. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan your line is live. Please go ahead. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. I just want to focus in a bit more on the cost side of the business. We have seen lumber and wood product prices generally inflating over the last several weeks. It feels like they are on a general upward trajectory as you think about the next several quarters in there. Can you talk about what you're seeing and how you're thinking about that element of the cost structure in fiscal '25? Paul Romanowski : Sue, we have seen lumber come up some recently. And as we look at next year, we are looking for relatively flat stick and brick. We have seen a good response from the labor markets. We see trades looking for business which tends to mean we can hold our costs as relatively flat. So as we kind of look at it all, we aren't sure exactly where lumber goes, as we move over the next several months, but feel like we don't expect much movement up or down in stick and brick over the next -- in 2025. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe turning to the rental side of the business. You mentioned in your comments that you expect your inventories to hold flat for the next several years. But as you do think about the potential that rates stay relatively higher versus lower in there, can you just talk about the demand that you are seeing on that rental side? And how you're thinking about managing that and meeting that need as well? Jessica Hansen : A quick clarification on the first part. The comment on our rental investment was over the next several quarters. Haven't spoken out to future years, that's going to depend on market conditions and where we get the return profile on that business in terms of what we're willing to invest in it. Paul Romanowski : Yes. And I think overall as we look at the market, we still see relatively solid demand in terms of the number of buyers in the market. We've certainly seen a reduction in apartment starts consistently over the past 12 months and feel good about our positioning, and the inventory we have in production, the timing that it's going to come to market. So still feel good about that segment, and we will monitor it quarter-to-quarter in terms of what we do with our starts and positioning on a go-forward basis. Susan Maklari : Okay, thank you for the color. Good luck with everything. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade your line is live. Please go ahead. Jade Rahmani : Thank you very much. What level of rates would need -- would you need to see to spur demand and get buyers off the sidelines as you've categorized? Would it be around a 100 basis point reduction? And would you need to see that through the 10-year treasury? Michael Murray : Hard to predict what's going to drive the rates, whether it's the underlying 10-year benchmark or the spreads to treasury. But more than any one given rate, I think stability in rates is most helpful for us in seeing buyers demand and come off the sidelines. So they are not waiting for rates to come down or fearful they are going to escape their ability to afford right now. Stability is good, we saw a tighter trading band in the mortgages in the third quarter, and we have a stronger sales environment. And there's had some seasonality to that as well, but we had more volatility in rates in the fourth quarter, and that was a negative to demand. Jade Rahmani : In terms of the APR you're currently offering, is it in the mid-5% range or low 5% range? I've seen at least one competitor in the 4s, but most do seem to be in that 5-ish percent range. Paul Romanowski : Our offering across the market can kind of range in the mid-4 to mid-5. The average in our backlog, I think Jessica alluded to earlier, was just over 5%. Jade Rahmani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to hand the floor back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Tom. We appreciate everyone\u2019s time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you in January to share our first quarter results. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on a successful fiscal 2024. Due to your efforts, we just completed 23rd consecutive year as the largest builder in the United States. We are honored to represent you on this call, and we look forward to everything we will accomplish together in fiscal 2025. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the form of presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jessica Hansen, Senior Vice President of Communications for D.R. Horton. Jessica Hansen : Thank you, Paul, and good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Before we get started, today's call includes forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although D.R. Horton believes any such statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual outcomes will not be materially different. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to D.R. Horton on the date of this conference call, and D.R. Horton does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could lead to material changes in performance is contained in D.R. Horton's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This morning's earnings release can be found on our website at investor.drhorton.com, and we plan to file our 10-Q in the next few days. After this call, we will post updated investor and supplementary data presentations to our investor relations site on the presentation section under news and events for your reference. Please note that we have added and updated several slides in our investor presentation to highlight our returns focused strategy and performance. Now I will turn the call over to Paul Romanowski, our President and CEO. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Jessica, and good morning. I'm pleased to also be joined on this call by Mike Murray, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Wheat, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For the first quarter, The D.R. Horton team delivered solid results, highlighted by earnings of $2.61 per diluted share. Our consolidated pre-tax income was $1.1 billion on $7.6 billion of revenues, with a pre-tax profit margin of 14.6%. We remained focused on enhancing capital efficiency to produce sustainable returns and cash flow. Our home building pre-tax return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended December 31st was 26.7%. Our return on equity was 19.1% and return on assets was 13.4%. Our return on assets ranks in the top 15% of all S&P 500 companies for the past three, five, and 10-year periods. During the three months ended December 31st, we generated consolidated operating cash flow of $647 million and returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the past 12 months, we returned essentially all of the cash we generated to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Overall, the demographics supporting housing demand remain favorable. And although both new and existing home inventories have increased from historically low levels, the supply of homes at affordable price points is generally still limited. To help spur demand and address affordability, we are continuing to use incentives such as mortgage rate buy downs and we have continued to start and sell more of our smaller floor plans. Our local teams have been successful meeting the market, with net sales orders this quarter decreasing only slightly from the prior year. We typically experience our seasonally slowest sales demand in the first quarter and our tenured local operators seek to find the right balance of sales pace, pricing, incentives, and inventory levels to position each community for optimal returns as we enter the spring. With 53% of our first quarter closings also sold in the same quarter, our sales, incentive levels, and gross margin are generally representative of current market conditions. With our focus on affordable product offerings, homes and inventory, continued improvement in our construction cycle times, and finished lots available in our pipeline, we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2025. Mike? Michael Murray : Earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 7% to $2.61 per diluted share compared to $2.82 per share in the prior year quarter. The income for the quarter was $845 million on consolidated revenues of $7.6 billion. Our first quarter home sales revenues were $7.1 billion on 19,059 homes closed compared to $7.3 billion on 19,340 homes closed in the prior year quarter. Our average closing price for the quarter was $374,900, down 1% sequentially and roughly flat with the prior year quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our net sales orders for the first quarter decreased 1% from the prior year to 17,837 homes and order value decreased 2% to $6.7 billion. Our cancellation rate for the quarter was 18%, down from 21% sequentially and from 19% in the prior year quarter. Our average number of active selling communities was up 2% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. The average price of net sales orders in the first quarter was $373,000, which was down 1%, both sequentially and from the prior year quarter. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Our gross profit margin on home sales revenue in the first quarter was 22.7%, down 90 basis points sequentially from the September quarter as expected due to higher incentive costs. On a per square foot basis, home sales revenues and stick and brick costs were both relatively flat sequentially, while lot costs increased approximately 3%. Our incentive costs are expected to increase further on homes closed over the next few months, so we expect our home sales gross margin to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our incentive levels and home sales gross margin for the full year of fiscal 2025 will be dependent on the strength of demand during the spring selling season in addition to changes in mortgage interest rates and other market conditions. Bill? Bill Wheat : In the first quarter, our homebuilding SG&A expenses increased by 6% from last year and homebuilding SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues was 8.9% up 60 basis points from the same quarter in the prior year and in-line with our expectations. Our increased SG&A costs are primarily due to the expansion of our operating platform. Our employee count is up 8% from a year ago. Our community count is up 10% and our market count has increased 7% to 126 markets and 36 states. The investments we have made in our team and platform position us to execute and sustain our strategic plans to produce strong returns, cash flow and market share gains. Paul? Paul Romanowski : We started 17,900 homes in the December quarter and ended the quarter with 36,200 homes in inventory, down 15% from a year ago and approximately 1,200 homes lower than at the end of September. 25,700 of our homes at December 31 were unsold, relatively flat with year-end. 10,400 of our unsold homes at quarter end were completed, of which 1,300 have been completed for greater than six months. For homes we closed in the first quarter, our construction cycle times improved a few days from the fourth quarter and approximately three weeks from a year ago. Our improved cycle times position us to turn our housing inventory faster in 2025, and we will continue to manage our homes and inventory and start pace based on market conditions and to achieve targeted closings by community. Mike? Michael Murray : Our homebuilding lot position at December 31 consisted of approximately 640,000 lots, of which 24% were owned and 76% were controlled through purchase contracts. We remain focused on our relationships with land developers across the country to allow us to build more homes on lots developed by others, which enhances our capital efficiency, returns and operational flexibility. Of the homes we closed this quarter, 65% were on a lot developed by either Forestar or a third-party, up from 62% in the prior year quarter. Our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots, land and development totaled $2.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion for finished lots, $710 million was for land development and $140 million was for land acquisition. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In the first quarter, our rental operations generated $12 million of pretax income on $218 million of revenues from the sale of 311 single-family rental homes and 504 multi-family rental units. This quarter's rental pretax profit margin was impacted by recent uncertainty in the capital markets and higher interest rates for purchasers of rental communities. We continue to operate a merchant build model in which we construct and sell purpose-built rental communities. Our rental operations provide synergies to our homebuilding operations by enhancing our purchasing scale and providing opportunities for more efficient utilization of trade labor and absorption of our land and lot pipeline. We are focused on improving our operational execution and efficiencies in both our rental businesses. During the last several quarters, we have been successful monetizing some of our single-family rental communities prior to leasing stabilization. We plan to continue this strategy to improve the capital efficiency and returns of our rental operations. Our rental property inventory at December 31 was $3 billion which consisted of $728 million of single-family rental properties and $2.3 billion of multifamily rental properties. We expect our total rental inventory to remain around the current level for the next several quarters. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Forestar, our majority-owned residential lot development company reported revenues of $250 million for the first quarter on 2,333 lots sold with pretax income of $22 million. Forestar's owned and controlled lot position at December 31 was 106,000 lots. 64% of Forestar's owned lots are under contract with are subject to a right of first offer to D.R. Horton. $220 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from Forestar. Forestar had approximately $640 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29.5%. Our strategic relationship with Forestar is a vital component of our returns-focused business model. Forestar's strong separately capitalized balance sheet, growing operating platform and lot supply position them well to capitalize on the shortage of finished lots in the homebuilding industry and to aggregate significant market share over the next several years. Mike? Michael Murray : Financial Services earned $49 million of pretax income in the first quarter on $182 million of revenues, resulting in a pretax profit margin of 26.7%. During the first quarter, our mortgage company handled the financing for 79% of our homebuyers. Borrowers originating loans with the DHI Mortgage this quarter had an average FICO score of 724 and an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. First time homebuyers represented 60% of the closings handled by our mortgage company this quarter. Bill? Bill Wheat : Our capital allocation strategy is disciplined and balanced to sustain an operating platform that produces compelling returns and substantial operating cash flows, while positioning for growth. We have a strong balance sheet with low leverage and strong liquidity, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and opportunities. During the first three months of the year, consolidated cash provided by operations was $647 million. We repurchased 6.8 million shares of common stock during the quarter for $1.1 billion, which reduced our outstanding share count by 4% from the prior year. As our stock price declined during the quarter, we accelerated some of our planned share repurchases for the year. Our remaining share repurchase authorization at December 31 was $2.5 billion. During the quarter, we also paid cash dividends of $0.40 per share, totaling $129 million, and our Board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level to be paid in February. At December 31, we had $6.5 billion of consolidated liquidity, consisting of $3 billion of cash and $3.5 billion of available capacity on our credit facilities. Debt at the end of the quarter totaled $5.1 billion with $500 million of senior notes maturing in the next 12 months. Our consolidated leverage at December 31 was 17%, and we plan to maintain our leverage around 20% over the long-term. At December 31, our stockholders' equity was $24.9 billion, and book value per share was $78.53, up 13% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended December 31, our return on equity was 19.1% and our consolidated return on assets was 13.4%. Jessica? Jessica Hansen : Looking forward to the second quarter, we currently expect to generate consolidated revenues of $7.7 billion to $8.2 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 20,000 to 20,500 homes. We expect our home sales gross margin for the second quarter to be approximately 21.5% to 22% and our consolidated pretax profit margin to be in the range of 13.7% to 14.2%. We have added guidance for consolidated pretax profit margin to provide more meaningful insight to our overall profit expectations. As a result, we no longer plan to provide specific guidance for quarterly homebuilding SG&A percentage or our financial services pretax profit margin. Our results for the full year of fiscal 2025 was to largely be dependent on the strength of the spring. For the year, we continue to expect to generate consolidated revenues of approximately $36 billion to $37.5 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in the range of 90,000 to 92,000 homes. We now forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2025 of approximately 24%. Based on our strong financial position, first quarter share repurchase activity and our expectation for increased cash flows from operations in fiscal 2025, we now plan to repurchase between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion of our common stock for the full year. We also continue to expect annual dividend payments of around $500 million. Paul? Paul Romanowski : In closing, our results and position reflect our experienced teams, industry-leading market share, broad geographic footprint and focus on affordable product offerings. All of these are key components of our operating platform that sustain our ability to produce strong returns, grow the business and generate substantial cash flows while continuing to aggregate market share. We have significant financial and operational flexibility, and we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation by providing compelling returns to our shareholders to enhance the long-term value of our company. Thank you to the entire D.R. Horton family of employees, land developers, trade partners, vendors and real estate agents for your continued efforts and hard work. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now host questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from John Lovallo from UBS. John your line is live. John Lovallo : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe starting off with just the gross margin outlook in the second quarter. So looks like sequentially going from 22.7% to 21.5% to 22%. Can you just help us with some of the moving pieces there. I mean, is that really the expectation of just higher incentive levels? Or is there something that changes sequentially in terms of land, labor and materials? Paul Romanowski : Hi, John really, it is just a matter of incentive levels and what we are seeing in the market today. We've closed 53% of the -- or 53% homes we closed this quarter were sold in the quarter. So we think representative of kind of where we are, and looking throughout the quarter, our margin on closings in December was a little lower than the prior two months. So based on the visibility we have today, what we are seeing in the market, we do expect a slight step down in margin on closings in our second quarter. John Lovallo : Understood. And then in terms of deliveries, it looks like you guys beat by about 1,000 units versus the top end, still kind of maintain that 90,000 to 92,000 guide for the full year. How would you kind of characterize that? Was there anything pulled forward into the first quarter that you didn't expect? Or is this more just a little bit of conservatism, just not knowing what lies ahead as we move into the spring? Michael Murray : I think we are always a little concerned in the fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal with the sales demand environment. We had the inventory and the teams did a great job of delivering that inventory to closings and putting people on home. So feel really good about the execution across the board. And we're positioned to continue to deliver homes, and we need to sell a fair number of homes this quarter that we are going to close this quarter, but we've got the inventory position to do so. Jessica Hansen : I think the beat really just reflects our continued improvement in build times and also the fact that we did sell and close 53% of our homes intra-quarter, that's a little bit higher than it typically would be for a December quarter. John Lovallo : Make sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Alan Ratner from Zelman & Associates. Alan your line is live. Alan Ratner : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for the details so far. First question on the start pace. That's been trending lower here, which I think makes sense given the environment. But three quarters in a row, down year-over-year. Just curious how you are thinking about the start pace going forward. Are you thinking about just given the improving cycle times, bringing back some components of BTO back in the business? Or do you feel like just given that improving cycle time, you can more appropriately match the start of sales going forward and still hit that full year guide? Paul Romanowski : Yeah, Alan, I believe that just the improved cycle times that we have seen have allowed us to carry a lower number of inventory, and that's why you've seen that sequential decline in our start pace. It does allow us to sell earlier in the process because of our ability to turn these homes faster. So it does allow us to pick up a little broader scale on the buyer demographic or demand that's out there. I\u2019d expect on a go-forward basis that you are going to see our starts to be more in-line with our sales pace. We just replenish the inventory that we have and start to build as we grow throughout the year. Alan Ratner : Okay. Great. Second question, we are day one here on the new administration, a lot of uncertainty about which direction some of the housing-related policies might go in, whether we're talking about tariffs or integration or the future of the GSEs. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about the next several years in the backdrop and whether you are changing any strategies or doing anything in anticipation of that? Bill Wheat : Alongside everyone else, we are keeping an eye on what will occur. But we've been through a number of changes in administrations before, and ultimately, we are just focused on what buyers can afford. We are going to continue to open communities and try to price our product as affordably as possible to meet the needs of home buyers. There is a core need for shelter and for homes in our country, and we are going to continue to do the best we can to supply it at an affordable price as we can. Alan Ratner : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Stephen Kim from Evercore ISI. Stephen, your line is live. Stephen Kim : Yeah. Thanks very much guys. Appreciate the color. I was really encouraged to see the share repurchases you did this quarter, and it is a tough environment and the cash flow was impressive. I think you had guided \u2013 you are guiding now -- continuing to guide for cash flow above 2024. Can you give us a sense for how you are thinking about cash flow from operations relative to your combined share repurchases and dividends because that I think might help dial in and even a little bit better. Bill Wheat : Sure. As we said in our scripted remarks, we've essentially distributed all of our cash flow from operations over the last 12 months to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. And so that would continue to be our general expectation as the substantial majority of our cash flow will go to repurchases and dividends. So our guide of the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion of repurchases and the $500 million of dividends is a good proxy for generally the range of where we would expect our cash flow from operations to be for the year. Stephen Kim : Yes. That's impressive. Appreciate that. And then second question relates to your leverage longer-term. I think you had indicated that your long-term leverage goal is around 20%. Can you give us a sense for like what kind of cash balance you guys would typically carry? So in other words, like what kind of net debt to cap do you think is a good target longer term for the company? Jessica Hansen : Sure. You are correct on the consolidated leverage target at or below 20%. Net, it is probably closer to approximately 10%. Cash is going to vary though quarter-to-quarter. We typically have our heaviest cash balance or our highest cash balance at the end of the fiscal year, call it roughly $3 billion. And then the other quarter is probably anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion. Stephen Kim : Gotcha. That\u2019s really encouraging. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is coming from Carl Reichardt from BTIG. Carl your line is live. Carl Reichardt : Thanks everybody. I want to talk about SG&A for a second. So talk -- Mike I think you had talked about the growth rate in store count, the growth rate in lots and business, people you've added. We'll start to anniversary those growth rates and you've talked about sort of balancing your pace with margins and returns more so and going forward. So especially because you are not going to be guiding on this anymore. Where do you sort of think your target SG&A ought to be? And when do you expect to see some better leverage on those SG&A dollars. Is it going to be later this year? I know seasonally, it will happen? Or will we start to see more in the next couple of years? Bill Wheat : As [we commented] (ph), we have made investments. We've expanded our market count, increased our community counts. As you know as well Carl, we are always focused on being as efficient as we can. So we would expect to see leverage overall in our SG&A. I think today, as we look at fiscal '25, we would expect our homebuilding SG&A percentage is probably a little higher than it was in '24, but we certainly expect to leverage those investments as we move beyond '25 into '26 in future years. We will be very focused on maintaining as efficient of an infrastructure as we can to support our growth. Carl Reichardt : Thank you Bill. And then about, I think 65% or I think -- you said of your total lots, you have with finished lot option contracts from developers. The other 35%, can you talk about self-developed lots and sort of what I call farmer auctions versus land banking transactions. And can you talk a little bit comment at all about your perspective on land bank transactions versus doing self-development on your own books? Michael Murray : I think, Carl the 65% we talked about at the closings in the quarter were on lots that were developed by a third-party or Forestar. So that would be a lot development professional entity that is developing finished lots for us. And that comes from deals they source, projects we source and assign to them and enter into buyback contracts kind of runs the gamut there. On the self-developed lots we -- the homes we closed on lots we self-developed, those were all done on our balance sheet, and we continue to explore other accretive ways for capital efficiency and whether that's sort of that, call it land banking development services, land banking process, we continue to evaluate and are looking to drive the most efficient capital usage in our lot pipeline. Jessica Hansen : We'll use land or lot bankers if we have an excess supply of finished lots that we are not ready for. But in terms of true traditional land development where you don't technically have a lot of risk transfer, we have little to no of that. We are 100% focused on risk transfer in the structures of our contracts. Carl Reichardt : Thanks guys. Thanks everyone. Operator : The next question is coming from Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Michael, your line is live. Michael Rehaut : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Congrats on the results. First question, I'd love to circle back to -- you had a comment in your prepared remarks around inventory levels. And the comment was, supply is still generally limited at affordable price points. I would love to dial in into that a little bit and see if there is any regional differentiation that you've seen across inventory levels. And as a result, perhaps which markets or regions that you operate in might be a little stronger versus a little weaker than the corporate average? Paul Romanowski : We have seen like has been reported, some buildup in the Florida market and certainly in certain of the Florida markets, a little more than others. The same in some of the Texas markets. But across -- generally across the footprint, we feel like inventory is in pretty good shape. We think that we and the other builders being pretty responsible in terms of watching the market, and based on what the market brings, sizing their inventory in kind and the resale market is just going to continue to play out, as people loosen up and eventually move and put their homes on the market. Michael Rehaut : Okay. Appreciate that. I guess secondly, your option lot percentage of 76%. I think you kind of maybe reached over the last year or two, a high of 80%. I think in the past, you've talked about most likely not going below a year's worth of owned supply. Maybe you kind of stay in that 1 year, 1.5 years range. So as we look forward, I know you are talking still about improving inventory turns or build cycle times. I'm just wondering how you guys think about further improvement on capital efficiency, what are those levers that you look to move. And if there is any rethinking of where that option lot percentage or years owned supply might be able to go over the next three years to five years? Bill Wheat : Well, Mike, our average is 76% across our operations. We do have markets that it is higher than that. And we obviously, have markets said it's lower than that as well. So we are still focused on continuing to ensure that we have a good network of third-party developers and we are utilizing Forestar as much as we can. So there still is opportunity for some of those markets that are at a lower option percentage to increase that. As Jessica did state earlier, we are very focused on risk transfer. And so if we are going to pay or to use a third-party to whether it is banking or developing lots, we are balancing what we are paying versus what the risk transfer and the capital efficiency benefits are. And so that's something we do continue to evaluate, as Mike said earlier, and we expect there will be opportunities for us to find ways to get more efficient with our lot pipeline going forward. Michael Rehaut : Great. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Matthew Bouley from Barclays. Matthew, your line is live. Matthew Bouley : Morning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So the closings guidance, I think, for the second half implies something like 52,000 homes closed or maybe 30% or so higher than the first half. I think is a little bit greater than normal or at least history. So I just want to get some color around your confidence in that step-up in closings. And it sounds like better cycle times, as you keep alluding to for sure, as part of that, but just any other assumptions we should consider that you are making in that kind of step up there? Thank you. Paul Romanowski : No. I think, we feel good about our efficiency today. We feel very good about our position of housing inventory, as well as the lot inventory that we need to achieve those numbers. Of course, we're very early in the spring selling season, and we need the spring to show up for us and to see the sales. But we believe that our operators are positioned to take advantage of the spring selling season be in position to deliver on our guide of 90,000 to 92,000 homes for the year. Matthew Bouley : Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then secondly, back on the gross margin. It sounded like the margin exited December a little lower than the prior two months, if I heard you correctly. So is that second quarter margin guide assuming that the margin on homes, I guess, sold and closed during Q2 would be similar to December or lower than December? And I guess, conceptually, at what point would you look to kind of more hold the line on the gross margin? Thank you. Michael Murray : So we continue to look at traffic and demand we see in the neighborhoods to affect the pricing and the margin in -- about maximizing the returns for us at a community level. But we entered the quarter in a roughly 6% mortgage environment, and we exited the quarter in a 7% mortgage environment, which is what we kind of rolled into Q2 with. And so that's coloring our margin outlook as well, looking at perhaps being a bit lower than December as we work our way through second quarter, but it is the spring and it is historically a better selling season, and we are optimistic about the trends we\u2019ll see. Matthew Bouley : All right. Thanks guys. Good luck. Michael Murray : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Sam Reid from Wells Fargo. Sam, your line is live. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much. So maybe just a follow-up on the prior question here. Could you guys give us a sense as to what gross margin is embedded in your backlog on houses that you plan to close in the second quarter. Kind of just curious for a rough number there. And then maybe one other number on that point would be any sense as to what the bought-down rate is in your backlog. I believe you provided that in past quarters. So just curious if we've got an updated number there. Bill Wheat : Sure. With regard to the margin and backlog, that is one of the key items that we do have visibility to when we are preparing our guide. So our margin in backlog is relatively consistent with the range that we are providing here for Q2. And then in terms of prevailing rate that we're offering in the market today, generally between $4.99 to $5.99 range depending on the product is what's prevailing out there really for the last little while across our sales offices. Jessica Hansen : And there is really no meaningful change in that average rate this quarter versus last quarter. Sam Reid : No, that helps. And then maybe more of a higher level question on labor costs and stick and brick costs. It sounds like those are looking to hold in Q2, although correct me if I'm wrong. But -- maybe could you just talk a little bit more broadly about your ability to manage higher costs on these two buckets from some of these exogenous factors we are seeing, whether it's the new administration's tone on remigration or higher material costs on the back of natural disaster rebuild. Just trying to get your rough sense as to sort of how you manage through those should we see inflation in labor and stick and brick? Thanks. Paul Romanowski : I think today, we are seeing good access to -- we have the labor we need and we have the materials we need, and that's what's allowed us to continue to see improvements in our cycle time. And given that, we've been able to hold pretty tight on pricing for both materials and labor. It has yet to play out to see what happens with this administration and what that impact is either through tariffs and/or labor, if it becomes a little more scarce but we feel good about our positioning in the markets with our market share and our ability to maintain the labor and the parts and pieces we need and still don't expect to see much inflation in either of those over the next 12 months. Sam Reid : That\u2019s helpful. Thank so much. I will pass it on. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Eric your line is live. Eric Bosshard : Good morning thanks. Two things, if I could. First of all, in terms of affordability, I'm curious as you think looking forward, I think your ASP indicated it is down 1%. Is there something more meaningful that you are considering or taking steps towards to address affordability? I know you talked about smaller homes, but is there a need to unlock or an opportunity to unlock demand by doing something more meaningful in changing the product and changing your ASP? Michael Murray : Hard to say that we can make a massive swing in the near-term from what we are doing. I mean, it is kind of an incremental change neighborhood by neighborhood. You are kind of -- I don't want to say locked in, but for the lots that are on the ground and that are approved by the municipalities. Oftentimes, they are also approving some product parameters and guidelines that kind of limit our ability to flex significantly within a short call it, a six-month to nine-month time frame. Longer-term, we continue to evaluate ways to be more efficient in the usage of land and development dollars relative to the stick and brick costs it takes to deliver a certain number of bedrooms, bathrooms and square footage for a homeowner. Jessica Hansen : For data points this quarter on homes we closed, our average square footage was down 1% from a year ago, which has been down a low single-digit percentage share for the last couple of years. Sequentially, it was relatively flat. And we did see another tick up in the number of attached homes, so call it townhomes and duplexes that we closed that was roughly 17% of our business which was up from 15% sequentially. Eric Bosshard : Okay. And then secondly, I know as you look forward to the spring selling season, rates were 7, rates were 6, rates are 7. Is your customer behaving differently with rates back at 7. Curious, especially in an environment where it feels like we are a little bit higher for longer. Is the consumer responding to incentives the same way? Is traffic the same? Or is it different this time back at 7? Paul Romanowski : We still -- our best incentive and most impactful to the consumer is utilizing some form of rate [dynamic] (ph) -- and that has increased for us throughout the quarter to try and maintain rates that seem to be in at least a comfortable enough place for them to move forward as far as their monthly payment. Still we are successful in achieving what we needed to in the quarter with 53% of the homes closed in the quarter, sold in the quarter. So we were able to navigate it through this past quarter. It is still early. We are only a couple of weeks into this quarter. But so far, I've been pleased with the traffic levels and with the sales pace that we are seeing in our models, we'll see how that continues. It is got a long way to go on the spring selling season. Eric Bosshard : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony your line is live. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. I wonder if you can give an update on what you are seeing with consumer debt levels and if you are seeing any real change in sort of availability or ability to qualify? And then when you look at kind of the first -- true first-time buyer versus more of a move, is one group may be holding up better than the other? Paul Romanowski : I would say that today, we've got the levels of traffic in our offices. It is a little easier for that move up buyer to move forward. Just to get to the sale and get to the final determination, certainly, that's been a little stronger the last quarter. We haven't seen a significant change in really the debt level or the credit makeup of our buyers because we do sell 59% I think, of our buyers through our mortgage company this past quarter were first-time homebuyers. We live in the world where if we could open up -- go down on the credit score significantly, it would significantly open up the buyer available to us, but we spend a lot of time in our sales offices working through those credit challenges and our buyers to get them in a position to buy their first home. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on smaller format homes or products like town homes or duplexes, understanding it varies by community. Is it possible to talk about sort of how the returns or the gross margin profile of smaller-format homes compares with a more traditional offering, if at all? Michael Murray : It is very similar, actually. If we look at our product and project performances, the margin is going to be very similar. If you are well-positioned with the right product, the right price, the right house, whether it is attached or detached, you\u2019re going to get similar outcomes in your margin and your returns. [indiscernible] Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. Operator : The next question will be from Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Mike your line is live. Mike Dahl : Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the pretax margin guidance. I appreciate that going forward, you want to frame your business this way. But if I look at it, you are guiding pretax margins at the midpoint down 280 basis points year-on-year and gross margins, you are really only guiding down 150 basis points. So can you -- it seems like there is something else kind of underneath the surface, whether it's on rentals or SG&A or Forestar this quarter, specifically in terms of 2Q. So can you help us understand that? Bill Wheat : Sure. Rental margins are lower, as we commented on the call that due to the capital markets uncertainty and higher interest rates, buyers of rental properties really over the last year have -- it's been more challenging for them. So margins in that business have been lower. It is a business that we're continuing to move forward with and would expect that in 2025, we are dealing with some supply out there that is a challenge, but that should alleviate as we move to the latter part of '25 and into '26. But I would say, primarily the change in the year-over-year gross margin beyond the homebuilding change would be in the rental segment. Mike Dahl : Okay. Got it. So year-on-year rental revenue and margin down significantly biggest driver. Bill Wheat : Yes. Mike Dahl : Got it. And then I guess going back to kind of the price versus pace discussion. I guess as you think about it, and again, you've added some -- you've made a point of -- that you added some additional slides around the return focus and change the way that you are guiding certain things. So -- I know you've been return focused for a while. But in the current environment, is that focus actually like shifting you to be a little bit more biased towards let's keep things kind of a little bit actually more kind of price and margin focus versus volume in the near-term. How would you say that your views are evolving there? Michael Murray : Well, we continue to evaluate the business at a community level. Community by community, our local operators are making decisions based upon the lot supply they have in a given project or a given submarket relative to demand that they are currently seeing in that market and looking to price and start homes, price those homes and sell those homes at a pace that's going to maximize the margin available at that pace and for what that submarket can absorb. And it is very much, again, I know it's repetitive about saying this, but it is very much a community-by-community buildup of what's happening. And we see the best outcomes there, and we don't, at the corporate level, dictate a pace or a margin to the field. We asked them to maximize the returns. And there are times when you lean more heavily into pace to get pace up and then once pace is up, you can oftentimes bring margin behind the sales momentum to help drive the returns up. But it is a balance that \u2013 it is probably a lot more art for us than it is science. Mike Dahl : Gotcha. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Ken Zener from Seaport Research Partners. Ken your line is live. Ken Zener : Hello everybody. Could you -- and happy to hear. Could you give color around the margin spread between the 47% backlog closings and the 53% spec, as well as comment on -- because you are at 126 markets, most of the builders [are about 50 markets] (ph) are most of their closings. Could you also talk maybe about the margin spread we see between those top 50 markets and your other 76 markets? Bill Wheat : So your first part of your question was between backlog and our spec closings --. Ken Zener : Yeah, margin spread. Michael Murray : Between the sold and closed in the same quarter. [indiscernible] I don't think we have that breakdown. I would say the 47% that were sold prior to the quarter and it's slightly different -- in a lower interest rate environment, we're going to be at a higher margin than what we exited the quarter at in December. But I don't have -- I can't give you any magnitude Ken. I'm sorry, I don't have that in front of me. Ken Zener : Okay. I think in the past, you guys talked about a couple of hundred basis points, I mean multi-years ago. So I didn't know if that might be a --. Jessica Hansen : That would have been build-to-order versus spec. Ken Zener : Okay. Regional margins, you guys stand out versus many of the peers in having very similar regional margins across your business. Is there any reason we didn't necessarily see more dispersion of margins in your business because Florida, Texas, the West, they are all pretty similar in that 16% range LTM. Just curious as to why perhaps we didn't see more of a spike in some markets versus others. Thank you very much. Michael Murray : I think not exactly sure, Ken, I think there is just an aggregation of enough markets in each one of our regional groupings that it kind of blends out any specific market differences where the market is performing differently or our execution is different. Bill Wheat : All of our markets are focused on maximizing returns community by community. And so it's a balance between margin and pace and inventory turns. And so yes, the better the margin, the better returns generally as well. And so that is focused across the board. Ken Zener : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Rafe Jadrosich from Bank of America. Rafe your line is live. Rafe Jadrosich : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I want to -- just on the land inflation that you're seeing today. I think you said up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Can you just run us in what that implies for the year-over-year trend? And then how do we think about that for the remainder of the year? I mean how does that compare to what you are contracting today, like are you seeing any relief there that we'll see flow through later on? Jessica Hansen : On a year-over-year basis, we were up 10%, which we've been up a high single to low double digit year-over-year for the last at least four quarters to six quarters. And on a sequential, it has continued to be just a low to mid-single-digit increase. I think our base case is going forward, it will remain a low-to-mid single for the foreseeable future. We are not necessarily seeing land prices come down, certainly not development costs when you look at an all-in lot cost. But we do think, on a year-over-year basis here at some point over the next couple of quarters, that should moderate to a mid to maybe just high-single digit. Rafe Jadrosich : Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the change in the share repurchase outlook especially like the pace, if you stepped it up in the guidance. Can you talk about -- have you continued that pace of buyback quarter-to-date? And then how do we think about sort of the pace as we go through the year? Was the step-up in buyback in the quarter related to just where the stock price was? Or is there any change in sort of philosophy or strategy in terms of like the pace of capital return relative to free cash flow? Bill Wheat : Yes, no change overall in strategy. We will manage our repurchases within our liquidity availability and our balance sheet targets, but we do have the flexibility within that liquidity to be able to accelerate repurchases when the share price is under some pressure. Obviously, we saw that this quarter and that continued really through the end of the quarter. So we continue to be a bit more aggressive in our repurchases. And judging based on where the stock price has been early this quarter, obviously, we are still out in the market. And so we are still being active. I would characterize some of the increase in the first quarter as an acceleration implied by our guide of the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. We did increase that guide, but not by the full amount that you -- that the acceleration would have occurred in Q1. So we continue to -- we manage based on our overall plan, what we feel like our liquidity and balance sheet and our cash flow will allow. But we will see it ebb and flow a bit depending on where the valuation of the stock is and when we see some opportunities to take advantage of dips in the stock. Rafe Jadrosich : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question will be from Trevor Allinson from Wolfe Research. Trevor your line is live. Trevor Allinson : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First, can you just talk about any different demand trends geographically, Southeast and South Central were two weaker regions for you guys on a year-over-year basis. So perhaps any demand commentary in Texas and Florida would be helpful. Matthew Bouley : Yes. I think that as we talked to a little earlier, some of the buildup we've seen in inventory has had some impact on sales when you look at portions of the Florida market and as well isolated to some of the Texas markets where they saw a significant run-up in valuations. We've seen some moderation there. But generally, as we enter into the spring, we've been pleased with what we've seen in these first few weeks in our sales offices across our footprint. Trevor Allinson : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then second question, understanding it is early and a lot of unknowns with the new administration. Can you just give us some color on some potential impacts that you think could be possible if we were to see a major change on immigration or then also tariffs on China and Mexico? Just what kind of impact do you guys think that could potentially have on you all? Thanks. Michael Murray : Hard to foresee what the impact would be, and we're not sure what the change is going to be yet. So we continue to, as Bill said before, prepared to provide an affordable product for our buyers that we can get a homeowner into and qualify for the mortgage. And so we do everything we can to bring that affordability into play. And if there is cost increases, that is not going to be helpful for housing affordability. And I do think housing affordability is a stated goal of the administration. So we are hopeful that they're able to do some things that will help drive affordability. Jessica Hansen : And we have had to deal with both immigration changes and tariffs in the past. So it is something that we are familiar with. And likely, although it is way too early to say the ultimate outcome, likely it is more regional in nature than something sweeping across our entire footprint, but it remains to be seen. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Buck Horne from Raymond James. Buck your line is live. Buck Horne : Hi, thanks good morning. Just one quick one for me. I was wondering if you've seen any inbound or uptick in inbound interest from single-family rental investors in some of the longer-dated finished unsold inventory? Or would you consider maybe negotiating or doing a bulk deal if an SFR investor wanted to come in and take some of that inventory off your hands? Matthew Bouley : We have really maintained our single-family for rent business as more of a merchant build. We have plenty of opportunity for those buyers to sell into those, and that can -- as we stated in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve started to do some of those more on a forward sale ahead of final stabilization. So we have plenty to offer to those buyers. We tend to haven't been heavy at all in selling in bulk our inventory. We are very comfortable with the inventory we have. We've largely maintained the number of completed inventory units, and that's exactly where we want to be as we enter into the spring selling season. So we feel good about our inventory on both sides of that on a for sale and on a build for rent basis. Buck Horne : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is coming from Susan Maklari from Goldman Sachs. Susan your line is live. Susan Maklari : Okay. Good morning everyone. My first question is on the consumer and the rate environment. If the Fed does cut less than expected or fewer times than expected this year versus, say, last year. But rates realize some level of stability as a result of that. Do you think that, that could be enough to ease some of the uncertainty or some of the fears that are leaving people on the sidelines? Or do you think that we actually need to see rates come down to see more of a lift in confidence and activity? Jessica Hansen : I think we'd take great stability all day long. If we could pick something today, it's much easier to manage our business and drive affordability if we know what the rate is going to be. And I think if rates remain stable for an extended period of time, that's going to get consumers off the fence that need to buy a house. They will ultimately reset their expectations on what they can afford, if they thought rates were going to go lower and they ultimately don't. So -- we don't have a base case scenario, nothing in our guidance assumes rate declines as we move throughout the year. Certainly, that would be helpful. But really, we would just take rate stability as pretty positive as we move throughout the year. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last question on the rental side of things. You did mention efforts to realize greater efficiencies and some operational execution there. As you think about eventually improving that margin, how much of that can come from your own efforts versus a shift in the overall market? Michael Murray : I think what we are looking at there Susan, is the ability to sell some of the projects prior to stabilization from a greater capital efficiency perspective from us. So in terms of \u2013 we are always looking to control our stick and brick cost and operate efficiently. That's just part of the DNA in the homebuilding for sale platform, as well as across the rental platform. But to see materially different changes in the financial performance and selling those assets, it takes a fundamental increase in rents, net operating income and decrease in cap rates to thoroughly change the valuation on those, everything we can control the cost side. But the efficiency side we're focusing on now is working with some of the buyers of the build-to-rent communities to sell them earlier in the process, prior stabilization. Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Good luck with everything. Michael Murray : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Alex Barron from Housing Research Center. Alex your line is live. Alex Barron : Thanks everybody. Good start to the year. I wanted to ask some of your competitors seem to have a philosophy of trying to sell a certain number of homes and do whatever it takes to get there, even if it means offering super low interest rates. Wondering if you guys have maintained the same approach to the business that you have historically or whether you guys have maybe approached it a little differently in terms of your willingness to balance margin versus pace. If you can comment on that. Paul Romanowski : I think as we have alluded to earlier, it is always a community-by-community buildup. And we are looking for a consistent pace in those communities that allows us to drive margin and a return community-by-community. So we aren't making that decision from here. We do rely on our local operators to balance what they need to. They need to be competitive in the market. So sometimes we may offer a rate or an incentive beyond where we would hope to. But at the end of the day, we're going to be competitive in the market to achieve the absorptions we need. And when we get on pace, it allows us to drive margin and therefore, returns at a higher level. But it's a community-by-community, market-by-market daily activity for our operators. Alex Barron : Got it. And then wondering if you can comment on Forestar. It seems like there are a number of lots sold, I suppose, mostly to you was lower than expected generally, but they seem to maintain the same number for the year. So was that just a timing issue? Or anything you can comment on that? Jessica Hansen : Yes, it was purely timing. Alex, they do expect their lot deliveries to increase throughout the remainder of the year. They had a pretty heavy percentage that they sold to us in Q4, and it was a little bit lighter in Q1, but we would just say that's timing related. Alex Barron : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question will be from Jade Rahmani from KBW. Jade your line is live. Jade Rahmani : Thank you. Can you comment on the pricing environment that's out there and whether the guidance assumes any price cuts because to get to the consolidated revenue guidance, it seems like we need to assume somewhat lower average sale prices. Bill Wheat : Our average sales price does reflect the level of incentives from our rate buydowns largely. And so that does have some impact on the average selling price. And yes, we've seen slight declines in our net average selling price over the last year, and we do still expect probably a little bit further downward movement in our net average selling price, largely because of the cost of the incentives that we are having to pay in terms of rate buy downs with the rates -- mortgage rates prevailing in the market being higher at the end of the quarter, we expect those costs to be higher in Q2, which will have an impact on the net ASP. Alex Barron : So what's a reasonable range for ASP to assume, would it be around 370,000? Bill Wheat : Yes, we are not guiding to that specifically. But we've seen modest generally sequentially 1% or 2% change. Really not expecting much more than that. Alex Barron : Thanks a lot. Operator : There were no other questions in queue at this time. I will now turn the call back to Paul Romanowski for closing remarks. Paul Romanowski : Thank you, Paul. We appreciate everyone's time on the call today and look forward to speaking with you again to share our second quarter results in April. Congratulations to the entire D.R. Horton family on producing a solid first quarter. We are honored to represent you on this call and greatly appreciate all that you do. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
