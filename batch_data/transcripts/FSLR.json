It is now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? Jim Hughes : Thanks, David. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings call. First off I would like to thank everyone who attended our Analyst Day in March be it in person or via webcast we appreciated the opportunity to share with you our outlook for the company and the industry at large. And particularly the tremendous response that received. Now turning to our performance in Q1, I will begin by taking a moment to recognize some of this quarter\u2019s achievements. We had earnings per share of $1.10 on a GAAP basis on revenue of $950 million both significantly above prior guidance and consensus expectations. Although it is early days our business development team booked 404 megawatt DC of new business year-to-date compared to shipments of 312 megawatts in the quarter resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1. Our opportunity set increased from 10.6 gigawatts to 12.2 gigawatts providing us with the project volumes necessary to replenish our pipeline backlog. And finally our best line modules on an average efficiency of 14.2% up from 13.9% in Q4 and 13% in Q1 2013, this lowers our costs increases our potential margins opens up new business segments and increases our total addressable market. These results are an impressive validation of our technology and business development efforts and our ability to continue to execute against the targets that we\u2019ve set for ourselves. Slides 5 and 6 show the total outstanding bookings in gigawatts and revenue and the change in those bookings that occurred in the first quarter. This data represents our total business which includes third party module sales. Total outstanding bookings rose from 2.7 gigawatts DC to 2.8 gigawatts The 404 megawatt DC in new bookings includes the previously announced Shams Ma'an project for 53 megawatt AC in the Kingdom of Jordan for which we will provide EPC and operations in maintenance and services. We also have won a 850 megawatt AC EPC agreement to design and build the projects in California. Construction is forecasted to begin later this year with full commercial operation anticipated in mid-2016. We will also be providing operations in maintenance services for the power plant once it is commissioned further details will be disclosed at a later today. In addition we signed EPC agreement for 43 megawatts AC with the EDF Renewable Energy to build projects on three sides in California. Construction is expected to begin on the projects this quarter with completion of all three by Q1 2015. We also anticipate announcing in the near future our first diesel PB hybrid agreement for 5 megawatts AC with a major international mining company in Australia. Working with our local partner in general we will build the solar power plan to complement the existing diesel generation at the mining side. This will provide economic and environmental benefits due to the reduction of the amount of diesel fuel used at times of peak demand. As we stated at our recent analyst day we see that hybrid market as an emerging business opportunity and this marks just the beginning of our expansion plans into this high growth potential sector. The remainder of the bookings consist the module sales. These bookings include locations such as Chile, Germany, India, Israel and Puerto Rico. The geographical dispersion of these bookings illustrates the breadth of demand for our product and it\u2019s testament to our success in penetrating new markets globally. This also shows that our module is becoming an increasingly competitive in our target markets and based on our technology roadmap will always become more sell in the future. Turning to outstanding bookings and revenue terms given the greater number of module of the deals in Q1 our bookings fell to $7.1 billion. As we stated at our Analyst Day, we are less focused on revenue as a metric and more focused on margin for per watt production. Module prices are stabilizing and our costs continue to fall. Switching to our opportunity set on slide 7, in addition to 3.8 gigawatts of backlog, we now have 12.2 gigawatts of near-term opportunities, up from 10.6 gigawatts at the end of the year. We have over 600 megawatts of new opportunities in the U.S. where the significant portion of that coming from the South East. We continue to see strong utilities scale growth across the country driven by more widespread adoption of Solar technology, increasing demand ahead of the exploration of the current ITC structure in 2016 and improvements in our relative competitiveness both from an energy density and cost perspective and back to our incredible warranty and guarantee provisions. We are also seeing increasing and sustainable demand outside of U.S. particularly in Latin America and Africa. The size of our mid-to-late-stage deals has also increased by 250 megawatts to 1.25 gigawatts with a moderate high power ability to suggest. While that shows the breakdown demand by geography, our opportunity set outside the North America is now 6.9 gigawatts and represents 57% of the total. This illustrate the increasing competitiveness of our products and services globally and the progress that we are making and penetrating our target markets. This continues to give us confidence and our ability to replace our pipeline going out to 2016 and beyond. Now I will turn it over to Mark, who will provide details on our Q1 financial results and our updated guidance for 2014. Mark Widmar : Thanks Jim and good afternoon. Turning to slide 10, I would like to begin by highlighting the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 441 megawatts DC, down 1% on a sequential basis, but 19% higher year-over-year, due to improved [capacity] utilization, higher module efficiency and throughput improvements on the same number of production lines. In the first quarter, we ran our factories at approximately 82% capacity utilization, down one percentage point from the prior quarter. Factory utilization was down sequentially due to planned line down time to implement our latest high efficiency, bad content material change. We are now operating all lines under the upgraded that content material change. The average conversion efficiency of our module was 13.5% in the first quarter, which was up 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 50 basis points higher year-over-year. Excluding our limited number of Series 3 modules produced for standard warranty replacement, the average fleet efficiency would have been 13.6%. Additionally, with the completed rollout of our (inaudible) program over the last few days nearly all 24 of our lines have been running at 14% efficiency or better. Our best line produced modules in Q1 with an average efficiency of 14.2%, a 30 basis points improvement compared to the prior quarter and a 120 basis points higher than the prior year. We\u2019re encouraged by our recent progress and remain on track to meet the efficiency improvements outlined at our Analyst Day. Regarding our technology roadmap, while we have completed the rollout of our [back] content program, there are two remaining efficiency improvement programs scheduled for the third and fourth quarters of this year. This should be kept in mind that as a result of the timing of these programs implementation efficiency improvement on our lead line will be lumpy and non-linear throughout the year. Efficiency improvements are hopefully average to be more linear and we\u2019ll continue to improve during Q2, while these line of improvements will be more modest until the second half of this year. Also what we no longer disclose are costs per watt for commercial reasons, our core costs declined quarter-on-quarter. Now moving to the P&L portion of the presentation on slide 11. First quarter net sales were $950 million compared to $760 million last quarter. The increase in net sales was primarily related to meeting all revenue recognition criteria on our Campo Verde project. This was partially offset by lower revenue recognition on our Desert Sunlight project related to fewer blocks scheduled to be turned over in the first quarter, as compared to prior period. Note that related to our Campo Verde project, we recognized a 100% of the project revenue in the first quarter while substantially all of the cash received in prior periods. As a percentage of total net sales, our systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the business project was 96%, an increase of 1 percentage point from the prior quarter. Gross margin for the first quarter was 24.9%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior quarter, due to lower balance of systems and module manufacturing costs. Our manufacturing and EPC teams continued to demonstrate operational excellence as we build out our project portfolio. Note relative to the expectations for the quarter, gross margin was barely impacted by higher sales volume, EPC and O&M bonuses related to the operating performance of our plants, EPC cost reduction and a potential litigation ruling related Campo Verde. First quarter operating expenses decreased 32 million quarter-over-quarter to 97 million. This decrease is primarily attributed to a lower pretax asset impairment charge of 0.5 million related to the fourth quarter write-down of our company idled facility in Vietnam. In addition operating expenses decreased due to the lower personnel costs and relocation expenses associated with the sale of our Mesa zone facility in Q4 of 2013. The quarter-over-quarter decline is reflective of our ongoing efforts to lower general and administrative expenses while continuing to fund R&D and sales and marketing. On a reported basis, first quarter operating income was 139 million, compared to 60 million in Q4. The increase was due to recognizing revenue on our Campo Verde project, improved O&M margins reduction in balance of systems costs and lower operating expenses. First quarter net income was $112 million or $1.10 per fully diluted share compared to $0.64 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate in Q1 was 21% compared to a full year 2013 tax rate of 7%. The increased tax rate is due to the difference in expected jurisdiction mix of income resulting in increased profits and higher tax jurisdiction. Additionally restructuring and asset impairment charges in the prior year continued to have lower tax rate. Turning to slide 12, I'll review the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by approximately $385 million to $1.4 billion. The decrease as communicated during last quarter\u2019s call was due to the ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet which will improve project economics and so at or near commercial operation. It was also due to the investment in global project development and the timing of some payments from Q4. Our net cash position decreased by $361 million to approximately $1.2 billion. Our net working capital excluding cash and marketable securities increased by approximately 218 million from the prior quarter. The change resulted from recognizing a 100% of deferred revenue and project cost related to Campo Verde in the quarter. In addition accounts receivable trade balances increased $98 million due to the billings and receipt timing in our systems business partially offsetting these items were the $53 million decrease in module and dealer inventory related to the build out of projects which have not yet been sold. Quarter-over-quarter total debt decreased by $24 million to $199 million. Cash flow used in operations was $318 million in Q1 compared to positive opt-in cash flow of $192 million in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $356 million compared to a positive $137 million in the prior quarter. [Notes in] both operating and free cash flow results were consistent with our Q1 guidance. Capital expenditures totaled $51 million for the quarter related to the investments in our technology roadmap of (inaudible) equipment. Depreciation for the quarter was $61 million compared to $62 million in the prior quarter. Turning to slide 13 we are providing an update to our 2014 annual guidance as follows, net sale of $3.7 billion to $4 billion is unchanged from the prior guidance. Next we are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance from 16% to 17% while keeping the high end at 18%. The increase is reflective of improved margin realization on the Campo Verde sale and other operational and project margin improvements from our strong Q1 performance. As a result of the increase in our gross margin guidance we are also raising our operating income range to $290 million to $340 million. Our earnings per share range $2.40 to $2.80 per share an increase of $0.20 compared to our prior guidance. While we exceeded our first quarter earnings guidance by approximately $0.55 this does not correspond to one to one increase in our guidance for 2014. As should be anticipated a portion of our better than expected Q1 results as related to the timing of earnings already considered in the guidance provided at the Analyst Day. However, it is also improvement to note that the better than anticipated Q1 results continues to [put up] the opportunity be patient that evaluating options to maximize the value of our contracted project pipeline. Our range of operating expense and factory remains unchanged. Turning to operating cash flow guidance. We\u2019re increasing the midpoint of the range by $50 million to a revised target of $300 million to $500 million. The increase is due to higher net income guidance for the year and result of operating cash flow for the first quarter. Capital expenditures are unchanged from our prior guidance. Finally, while we do not provide the straight quarterly guidance it is noteworthy that our second quarter 2013 earnings will be significantly lower than the current consensus estimate of approximately $0.60 due to the expected timing of certain project sales. This implies that the remainder of the earnings for the year will largely be reflected in the second half of the year and we\u2019ll see consensus estimates for those periods. Now moving to slide 14, I\u2019d like to summarize our progress so far this year. The first quarter is a strong start to the year across all operating and financial metrics. First we achieved 14.2% average efficiency on our lead mine and remain on track to the efficiency roadmap communicated at the Analyst Day. Next we continue to implement our pipeline geographically the first bookings of over 400 megawatt DC. We continue to build out our budget pipeline and increase our global opportunity set to over 12 gigawatts. From a standpoint we exceeded our Q1 guidance on both earnings and cash flow additionally we\u2019ve increased our full year earnings and operating cash flow guidance. With that we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). And we will take our first from Shahr Pourreza at Citibank. Please go ahead. Shahr Pourreza - Citibank: Hey, Jim and Mark, how are you? Mark Widmar : Good. Jim Hughes : Great. Shahr Pourreza - Citibank: Just let me just one question and just a quick follow up. Jim you have been very calculated when it comes to a decision and whether you would commit to doing a year going out. Recently we\u2019ve seeing several participants on the solar and utility side, commit to forming an alternative financing vehicle. So market is starting to develop. Given the share number of YieldCos that are likely going to form over the next several month, has your approach changed is the first question. And then the second question is, are you now more incentivized to take on the construction risk and capture maybe higher economics by selling to and existing YieldCos. Thanks? Jim Hughes : Let me start with the second because it\u2019s easiest. I have been indicating for at least the year and half now that we are more than willing to take on construction period risk because we believe the increase in the value of our asset more than justifies that risk. That view point, that philosophy was filled into our business planning before anybody was really talking about YieldCos quite frankly. That managing the risk during that time period should be a core competency of the company. You should take on risk that it is your core competency and capture the value that represents. So we have been perfectly willing to take those risks on and we will continue to be willing to take those risks on irrespective of whatever decision might be reached with respect to YieldCos. Turning to specifically to YieldCos we note all of the filings and all of the announcements, some of those announcements are by customers or other companies that we have had expensive dealings with. We continue to talk continuously with a lot of market participants, financial advisers about the [trends] in the market, how investors are viewing these vehicle. We tend to monitor developments in Washington and then look as best we can into our crystal ball, with respect to what overall tax policy for North America and the U.S. market looks like. And all of those things factor into the attractiveness or like there of a YieldCos. And I don't think our view points or philosophies have shifted significantly than the comments that I made at Analyst Day, it is something that we continue to actively look at. But it is not something that we feel compel to make any sort of eminent or urgent decision. I think we feel like the -- we have full optionality to take advantage of market attitudes towards such a vehicle, if it looks like it's interesting. We have full optionality to market assets to YieldCos that either are not in existence today or coming to existence in the future or we can market and sale assets to our traditional customers in the same manner that we have. One of the things that I think we have learned through our year or so of investigating is that we've been pretty good at monetizing our assets pretty efficiently. And we have not left a lot of value or money on the table historically. We will continue to be rigorous and make sure we're not leaving any money on the table in the future. And I don't think that we really -- there is nothing that has changed our view point since the comments I made at Analyst Day. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Lee at Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. If I look at your bookings run rate versus last year, it seems like you are a bit behind last year\u2019s trajectory at the same time. And my question is if you had any updated thoughts on book-to-bill for 2014, I think if we recall that 2 gigawatts bookings target for the year at the Analyst Day? And then as a follow-up on cost, utilization was down a percentage point, but the original efficiency was up 10 basis points versus 4Q. I guess I am wondering if you can elaborate on few of the drivers that impacted the cost per watt for it to get [consequently]? Thanks. Jim Hughes : Sure. I will take the first and then I will hand over to Mark for the second. From a bookings momentum standpoint, we can get a look at the exact numbers, but I don't think there is a material difference between this year and last year and there is certainly nothing in the (inaudible) that will change our view point something here they were expressed at the Analyst Day. We feel pretty good about what we got (inaudible) in the first quarter and we feel pretty good about the backlog and opportunities that we\u2019ve got available to fill out what we've targeted for the rest of the year. So generally, pretty happy and pleased with the job that our teams are doing. And I'll let Mark comment on the cost issues. Mark Widmar : Yes. Really anything else there on that as well is if you just look at the total pipeline opportunities set, from what we talked about in the Analyst Day which was sort of few weeks or so at March where it is now we\u2019ve added a 1.5 gig or so, more than that actually, new opportunities. So, the activity that\u2019s happening on all bases is very robust and I would argue it's consistent with our ability to build or to achieve our book-to-bill ratio for the year. On the cost-end front of (inaudible), consistent Brian we said this in the last few quarters. We've been very good at getting momentum across all factors that impact the cost per watt. So the efficiency was up sequentially, our throughput has improved and the variable costs, we continue to drive down cost around building material and other variable costs has all been favorable that helped drive down the cost per watt. And again just the utilization rate sequentially was a nominally change and as I indicated with plan down to capture that utilization or future net efficiency benefit which we now have all of our lineup and operational with our latest back content material, which is given up and then we should be running all of our lines at least 14% efficiency or better. Jim Hughes : Yes Brian, on the bookings with regard to megawatts we\u2019re slightly ahead of where we were a year ago, we\u2019re lower in revenue terms that's mainly due to the module bookings for that we have in this quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Patrick Jobin at Credit Suisse. Brandon Heiken - Credit Suisse : Hi, this is Brandon Heiken for Patrick. Thanks for taking the questions here. I was wondering if you could clarify on the improvement in gross margin, it sounds like it's from the project side, I just want to sit double check that? And then for the $50 million improvement in operating cash flow, how much of that is from higher margins of other factors? Thank you. Jim Hughes : So, the first one on the operating or the margin improvement, a lot of it is that we've been seeing continued to perform very well as it relates to the build out of our projects and driving costs down. We're getting better at overall productivity a lot of we have the projects all that helps and drive down the cost of delivery in the project. So that\u2019s big chunk of it. But the other thing that I said in my comments, which I think are important to notice that we see benefits within the quarter around energy, one year energy test around our EPC projects. So we've actually outperformed the energy for the first year and leave in our (inaudible) we've got examples of what we've achieved bonuses because our plants have over performed the energy prediction. So both cases that our plants are performing at a very, very high level and obviously driving upside in terms of bonuses and flow straight to the bottom-line performance for the company. And remind me of the second half of your question. Brandon Heiken - Credit Suisse : And then for the operating cash flow for the year with that increase of $50 million, how much of that is from the higher gross margin or what other factors contributed to that? Jim Hughes : Yes, I would argue I think of it is about half of it is associated with gross margin movement and then the balance of it is just driven by working capital management. Operator : And our next question comes from Vishal Shah at Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank : Yes hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to check on the yieldco, you mentioned what percentage of your projects today are yieldco ready? Jim Hughes : I believe is one percentage of our projects are yieldco ready. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank : Yes, turned to yieldco or used to former yieldco? Jim Hughes : We continue to construct a lot of our assets on balance sheet and we are trying to capture improved economics as a sell down closer to COD. So we have three projects right now that sold a little over 200 megawatts that effectively are at or near COD. And then you look at the balance of the year of other projects coming on we hadn\u2019t even check our pipeline that we reported in our Q. We have more than sufficient volumes if we chose and we said this at the Analyst Day and we showed a slide on this as well; if we chose to go a yieldco rather than we get it on our own or we leverage the opportunity of capturing essentially better value for the project and the sell down to yieldco. Operator : And our next question comes from Paul Coster at JP Morgan. Paul Coster - JP Morgan : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019m going to (inaudible) actually first one is market, Jim you mentioned in your prepared remarks that something like 600 megawatts have been added to part line in the U.S. can you give us some sense of clearly you have North American demand where is the demand coming from regionally size of project type of (inaudible)? Another question to Mark and it relates to your comment around the upside in the first quarter you would see some sort of flexibility some patience. What were you referring to, is it more visibility to hold things through the COD? Thank you. Jim Hughes : So, in terms of the North American demand we\u2019re seeing pretty robust and broad demand across a broad set of regions, as well as a broad set of project types and sizes. So we\u2019ve seen demand through the year in the 100 megawatt plus class in the Western United States sort of in the California market which is very typical of our traditional U.S. utility scale project. We\u2019ve seen demand in the Southeastern United States, we\u2019ve seen demand in the upper Midwest, we\u2019ve seen demand in the Southwest and those have been down to very, very small projects of more consistent with the commercial and industrial scale side up to renewable utilities scale project. So right now we\u2019re seeing a more diverse demand picture in the United States than we\u2019ve seen at least at any time since I\u2019ve been involved with those projects. And then my comment Paul at the end was just I think we tried to highlight that thing during the Analyst Day that we\u2019re continuing to be patient and we\u2019ll make where we think the right long-term decision as we operate to manage the business and then trying to capture the best economic and keeping all options available for whatever path we want to go down. By having a strong quarter, strong results and a lot of this flexibility and optionality continue to evaluate and we want to those things we make and we close up this year and both decisions we make as we move into 2015 how faster or not, and we build out the project, we are happy in terms of when we sell projects how long the old projects are having that strong kind of foothold underneath that with the first quarter I think enhances our opportunity (inaudible) to be very patience. Operator : And our next question comes from Krish Shankar at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Hughes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good afternoon, guys. You have Andrew Hughes on for Krish. Congrats on the strong quarter. Jim, I am wondering I\u2019d be the qualitatively or quantitatively, if you can give us a sense of how you are seeing valuations for fully developed assets maybe changed over the last even three to six months and yieldco demand elsewhere has picked up, have you seen sort of what people are willing to pay on EBITDA basis on a yield basis increase or decrease respectively? Jim Hughes : Yes, let me extend the comment back to the last two years. So one of the things that was most notable to me when I joined the company when I came into the industry was that the cost of capital appeared to be significantly higher for Solar assets than for other generation assets, but when traditional problem assets that was similarly fully contracted. My own perspective was that solar assets were lower risked in those assets be at a more reliable resource and we had the absence of commodity price risk and less operational risk than other classes of assets. And so that delta in cost of capital felt like an arbitrage opportunity to me. And I have said fairly consistently for at least a year and half that I felt like we were going to see a consistent and steady drop in the cost of capital for renewable solar projects, particularly in the North American market. That's exactly what we've seen that has continued up including the last six months. YieldCos have been a part of that, but they have not been the sole source of that. We can look at the required return of our traditional customers going back 18 months, 24 months and look at the required returns today and there is a significant delta between the two. So, it's not solely as a result of YieldCos, it's been a more broad adjustment in the market\u2019s perception of these assets. And I said then and I continue to say today that I don\u2019t see any reason that these assets should not trade at least at par with competitive forms of generation similarly situated if not a premium. So, it's really not what we're seeing, it\u2019s not unexpected, it's what I thought was going to happen in the market. How much more do we have to run? I don't know, the gap has been closed quite considerably compared to what it looked like 18 months, 24 months to ago. I think that you'll see the lower cost of capital extend to a broader segment of the market. We now see stratification or differentiation depending upon size of project and quality and the credit of the offtake. That's a rational way for the market to look at it but I think we may see lower cost of capital come into other segments of the market as more product becomes available and as investors get comfortable with it. So it\u2019s been a consistent aspect to our industry that we\u2019ve observed and watched for the last 18 months to 24 months. Operator :  And our next question comes from Rob Stone at Cowen & Company. Rob Stone - Cowen & Company: Hi guys, couple of questions if I may. The first one with respect to the big outperformance in Q1, what was the biggest thing that changed from the time you gave the guidance to the five weeks again in the quarter? and I think you said something Mark about lawsuit related to Campo Verde, was there something that allows you to pull in that revenue related to that? Thanks. And I have a follow-up. Mark Widmar :  Yes, as I said in highlight, the earning, the script was the primary drivers would be topline revenue relative to mid-point were about $100 million. We received annual bonuses for couple of our EPC projects as well as for O&M projects that we have. And again those are one year type of energy test, performance availability test and we got results of those here in the third month of the core, so we are able to benefit from that. We\u2019ve seen continued improvement as it relates to our ability to construct our project pipeline and do that in a very efficient manner to continue to drive out cost. So that helped us as well. And then as we did have potential reserve set aside for litigation risk on Campo that has been resolved successfully. And so as we released the overall -- recognized the revenue on Campo Verde, we were able to reduce the cost plan because we didn\u2019t have to deal with that litigation. And so I want to make sure it\u2019s clear, that was a relatively small portion of the overall piece. So, I wanted to highlight that this did impact the quarter, but majority of the results were more operationally driven and a little bit of timing because of revenue form. Operator : And our final question today comes from (inaudible). Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you, good afternoon all. I have two questions on your pipeline. So the total potential booking continues to grow nicely of up to [12 last year]. How should we think about overall emerging base on this pipeline even though it\u2019s fairly different (inaudible) externally? Jim Hughes :  Yes. Okay. So yeah, what you're going to see is still a handful of large projects that are in that pipeline that will carry out multiple quarters, (inaudible) being another. But you're going to start to see a greater velocity, because the average project size is going to be quicker. And if you even look at what we announced with EDF today, the project we highlighted there, portion of that volume will be constructed by the end of this year and then the balance will be constructed in 2015. So, you're going to start to see better velocity and better turn against that backlog. We won't see again the four major projects that we have that almost cost 2 plus gigawatts DC of volume. That\u2019s type of the long build out schedule that lasted most of the year, so you'll see less than from that and we'll see more project with greater velocity. Operator : And our final question comes from Tyler Frank at Robert Baird. Tyler Frank - Robert Baird : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you can just touch on how we should think about efficiencies for the rest of the year and also what you're seeing in the C&I market and the potential for increased rooftop deployment? Jim Hughes :  Well, I will take the last one and then I will let Mark talk about the efficiency. So, as we are kind of surveying the North American market space and talking to potential channel partners on the C&I front one, I think as we -- you will remember we presented at Analyst Day, we really divided C&I into two distinct categories : the group side of the [meter] and behind the [meter]. The group of [meter] is really executed by our traditional project development group and that doesn\u2019t look or feel terribly different from all of the activity that we have been doing historically. Those are typically around the systems; it\u2019s typically an RFO or RFP process, it doesn\u2019t look a lot terribly different from a utility process. So that one is pretty straight forward and looks, feel the same. The behind the [meter] which can be ground map but often is also rooftop, I don\u2019t think that we are looking to directly execute; we will build channel partnerships. And at this stage what we are seeing is a highly fragmented market with lots of potential channel partners. And I would say we are spending a lot of our time trying to best analyze those partners and figure out who we think the right partners are going to be as we push into that market segment. But we certainly see lots of volume and opportunity. Obviously it will be much, much smaller highly repetitive transaction. That\u2019s why we think we need to execute through channel partners and we will have to -- it will take some time for us to build the model with each one those partners to the point that it becomes repetitive and begins to be a significant contributor. So, I would think that it\u2019s going to be towards the end of the year before we really begin to see significant contributions. But this is not -- there is no shortage of activity; it\u2019s us getting our feet wet and getting our own processes and partners in place that will allow us to pursue that pretty aggressively. Mark Widmar : And relative to the efficiency, I highlighted a little bit in the script too that we\u2019ve seen a significant improvement; we had a major roll out here over the last few quarters as it relates to our that concept of change and you\u2019re seeing the benefit of that as I indicated in the call. In fact we have all the lines that are operational running at 15% -- excuse me, 14% entitlement. We\u2019ll see that, in Q2 we\u2019ll see the balance of the fleet start to approach the lead line number that we\u2019ve referenced which is kind of around [42%] and then you\u2019ll see more in the second half of the year as we roll out two new efficient campaigns, so you\u2019ll see the bump in Q3 and a bump in Q4. On the lead line in particularly and you\u2019ll start to see the fleet move up as well. But all that is consistent with the information and the guidance that we provided during the Analyst day. So everything we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019re highly encouraged and we feel we\u2019ll move in the right direction needed to do as well and a lot better than what we provided in the Analyst Day. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Vishal Shah at Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark and Jim I wanted to find out if there is any change in the competitive landscape as you bid for some of the utility skilled projects here in the U.S. especially in light of some of the recent shred in and the investigations? Are you seeing less competition from the Chinese and have you been also seeing any changing in pricing given that the competitive pricing environment is getting better? Thank you. Jim Hughes : What I would say around the competitive landscape is it\u2019s still very, very competitive. I would say that our differentiation and our capabilities and it\u2019s been -- continues to be more and more appreciated and I also think that where we are with our roadmap and where we are going to go with our installed cost is being very well received and we are generally continuing to be identified as a partner of choice. Pricing again is competitive, it\u2019s very competitive, it is in some cases moderating a little bit, we may say it\u2019s starting to [lock] in certain situation, but I don\u2019t want anyone to walk away from the discussion that prices are moving into rapidly in an upward direction, but they are no longer falling and no longer as aggressive as we\u2019ve seen them being in the past. I think there is also a number of whether utilities (inaudible) or others are concerned about people\u2019s ability to construct the assets in the face of the IPC exploration and so they are looking to a proven partner like for Solar to step into that and there is more of a premium associated with our ability to execute and deliver on that. So, all that I think is helpful for us to market. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Baird Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Edwin Mok - Needham & Company Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the First Solar's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Brady, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations for First Solar Incorporated. Mr. Brady, you may begin. David Brady : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a technology update and a review of our projects bookings and opportunities year-to-date then Mark will discuss our second quarter results in detail and provide an update for 2014 guidance. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Please note that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce our Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? Jim Hughes : Thanks, David. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. Today we announced the new world record for CdTe cell efficiency of 21%. A milestone certified at the Newport Lab and documented in NREL\u2019s best research cell efficiencies. This is a fantastic achievement on the part of (inaudible) and his R&D team. This breaks our previous record of 20.4% that we announced in February and represents the seventh update to CdTe cell efficiencies since 2011. It also exceeds the multi crystal and silicon record of 20.4% set ten years ago and the current CdTe\u2019s record at 20.9%. We stated at our recent analyst day that our target research cell efficiencies by the end of 2015 is 22% and this new record puts us well on our way to meeting this goal. Switching to the module. In Q2 our average efficiency increased 0.5% to 14%, our biggest increase in efficiency in a single quarter since becoming a public company. To put the extends of this achievement in perspective, the total increase in our module efficiency last year was 0.5% and we achieved this in a single quarter. Furthermore early in Q4, we expect our lead line efficiency to be 14.6%. It is this acceleration and efficiency improvements that enabled us to begin penetrating phase constrained markets such as distributed C&I including rooftop. Although easy to compare conversion efficiency is a narrow major of module performance; energy yield produced is a superior matrix. We introduced the concept of energy density at the analyst day, which is energy yield per meter square and in addition to the conversion efficiency this incorporates several other factors to drive the energy produced by the module including temperature, humidity and shade tolerant. As Raffi explained previously CdTe technology has advantages in each of these areas which currently offsets our efficiency disadvantage and in the future will add to the efficiency advantage we expect to have over our multicrystalline competitors. Slide five shows our energy density trend relative to multicrystalline silicon. Based on our lead line at the end of Q2, our energy density disadvantage stands at about 12%. By the end of this year, we expect to trend that density to only 5% and then have an energy density advantage at some point next year. We will continue to monitor and periodically report on this metric as it is a key major of our competitiveness and highlights the tremendous progress we are making. Next, I would like to highlight the ongoing progress in our O&M business. As we have stated previously, we intend to evolve this business into a global third party provider of services. With our recent acquisition of skytron energy, we are moving forward in that direction. skytron has installed monitoring and control systems in more than 600 plants across 27 countries with the total installed capacity in 5 gigawatts. This acquisition more than doubles First Solar\u2019s portfolio global portfolio of monitored assets and provides strategic positioning in the European O&M market which is expected to grow to 35 gigawatts by 2017. In addition to the skytron acquisition, our core O&M continues to demonstrate tremendous growth with year-to-date bookings of over 800 megawatts with another one gigawatt of late stage opportunities we expect this O&M bookings number to continue to grow. Slide seven and eight show the total outstanding bookings in gigawatts and revenue and the change in those bookings that occurred in the second quarter, this data represents our total business which includes third party module sales. Total outstanding bookings increased from 2.7 gigawatts DC to 3.2 gigawatts DC. Total bookings since the last earnings call were 800 megawatts DC against shipments of around 400 megawatts DC during the same time period. The single largest booking in the quarter was a 310 megawatt AC DPA that we were awarded by SoCal Edison with commercial operation date of 2019. In addition we signed EPC to construct 175 megawatt AC project in California with the commercial operation date of 2016. These wins highlight our continued strength in the Southwestern United States and are significant additions to our pipeline. Our bookings also continue to show increased geographical diversity. In India, we have reached the new milestone with the announcement of our first self developed projects in that country. We will begin construction on multiple projects this year totaling 45 megawatts AC. These projects provide an opportunity to gain valuable development and EPC experience which we will be able to leverage at the solar market in India continues to grow. In Asia, we recently announced the establishment of supply agreement with XSOL, a leading distributor and integrator of solar systems in Japan. The agreement targets installation of 100 megawatts DC per year of First Solar\u2019s cad-tell thin film module in Japan. We believe there is tremendous growth potential for cad-tell modules in Japan and this agreement adds to our momentum in this market. Turning to outstanding bookings in revenue terms, our expected revenue increased from $7.5 billion to $7.6 billion reflecting the strong bookings number. Our focus remains on maximizing margin for water production whether that comes in the form of a module only sale constructing a portable-type power plant or some other offering. Turning to slide 9, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which now stands at 12.7 gigawatts DC and increase from 12.2 gigawatts in the prior quarter. The approximately 500 megawatt increased in new opportunities is primarily related to continued growth in the U.S. but also driven by new opportunities in Latin America. In the U.S. the growth is not only from projects in the Southwest but also continued strong utility scale demand across the country, driven impart by the exploration of the investment tax credit in 2016. In Latin America, the number of opportunities in Chile as well as Brazil continues to grow. The size of our mid and late stage deals which has been moderate to high probability of success was about flat at 1.3 gigawatts, included in our late-stage opportunities is the 141 megawatt AC Luz del Norte in Chile which has been recently announced as received board approval from OPIC and IFC for construction financing. The projects remains on track to financial close and will be included as booking in our pipeline after reaching that milestone. Slide 10 shows the breakdown of demand by geography our opportunity set outside in North America remains robust at 6.8 gigawatts or 54% as the total. We are encouraged by the recent aforementioned project in various countries and given the signs of our potential international opportunities we see this momentum continuing. Finally, I would like to provide a brief update on our position with respect to yields curve. As we stated previously this is an issue that we felt needed careful consideration. We did not believe we needed to rush into a decision but rather take into the account the evolving industry dynamics and make the best long-term decision for our shareholders. With that in mind we are nearing the end of our decision making process and subject to market conditions we expect to make a final decision near-term by the next earnings call at the latest. In the event that we decide to proceed ahead of that time we will have a separate conference call to make that announcement. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our Q2 financial results and discuss guidance for 2014. Mark Widmar : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Turning to slide 12, I\u2019ll begin by highlighting our operational performance for the second quarter. Production in the quarter was 447 megawatts DC, an increase of 1% on a sequential basis and 15% year-over-year due to higher module efficiency and throughput improvements on a same number of production lines. Our factory capacity utilization was 80% down two percentage points from the prior quarter. Factory utilization was down sequentially as we finished the fleetwide rollout of our new Series 3 Black module in back contact technology, which facilitated the record quarterly efficiency gains Jim referenced. The average efficiency of our module was 14% in the second quarter which is up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 100 basis points higher year-over-year. Continuing the trend over the last several quarters, our efficiency improvements remains steadfast in July with our lead line and fleet average increasing from our June exit. Furthermore as a reference a roadmap for the end of Q3 slash the first part of October will have our lead line operating at 14.6% efficiency, which is a primary driver of the sequential improvement in energy density as Jim referenced. Lastly, our module cost per watt continues to decline driven by both efficiency and material costs improvements. Now, moving to the P&L portion of the presentation on slide 13, second quarter net sales were $544 million, compared to $950 billion last quarter. The decrease is due primarily to revenue recognition on the Campo Verde project in the prior quarter partially offsetting the 130 megawatt AC Campo Verde project with the sale of 50 megawatt AC Macho Springs projects in Q2. The revenue recognition for both of these projects was on a completed contract phases. Relative to projects was ongoing revenue recognition AVSR and Desert Sunlight revenue was lower quarter-over-quarter. AVSR decline as the project nears completion and was anticipated. In contrast Desert Sunlight experienced an unexpected inverse system integration issue, which will defer revenue from Q2 into the second half of the year. Note it is important to highlight a remediation plan is in place and the project remains unplanned for the year. As a percent of total sales, our system revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems project was 88%, a decrease of 8 percentage points from the prior quarter, reflecting the lower systems revenue an increase in third-party module sales. Gross margin in the second quarter was 17% down from 24.9% in the prior quarter. The decrease in gross margin was affected by the higher mix of module business in Q2, the mix of system projects between the quarters and the deferral of revenue from Desert Sunlight through the second half of the year. Second quarter operating expenses decreased 7 million quarter-over-quarter to 90 million. This decrease is primarily attributive to reductions and R&D spending related to the rollout of our Back Contact program which primarily impacted the first quarter. This reduction in R&D expense is expected to be temporary as we continue to rollout additional efficiency improvement programs in the second half of the year. On a reported basis, second quarter operating income was $2 million compared to $139 million in Q1. The decrease was due to lower sales and gross margin partially offset by lower operating expenses. Second quarter GAAP net income was $5 million or $0.04 per fully diluted share compared to $1.10 per fully diluted share in the first quarter. In Q2, we had a small tax benefit due to the impact of certain discrete items. Turning to slide 14, I'll review the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by approximately $30 million to $1.35 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly or remained at $1.2 billion. This minor decrease includes the impact of approximately $73 million of cash used to collateralize and significantly reduced the cost of certain letters to credit. These restricted LCs remain highly liquid and can be converted back into cash in five days. It's not for this transaction our cash position would have increased from the prior quarter. Our network and capital excluding cash and marketable securities decreased by approximately 49 million from the prior quarter, the decrease was driven by the increase in deferred revenue for Desert Sunlight and Silver State South partially offset by an increase in project assets as we continue to construct some projects which were not yet sold. Cash flow from operation was $118 million compared to a use of cash in Q1 of $318 million. Free cash flow was $60 million compared to negative $357 million in the prior quarter, operating cash flow was strong for the quarter especially considering we continue to build certain projects on the balance sheet in order to capture greater value. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $62 million, an increase from $51 million in the prior quarter as we purchased more equipment related to the TetraSun ramp. Depreciation for the quarter was $63 million compared to $61 million in the prior quarter. Turning to slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the remainder of 2014. First and most importantly we are reaffirming our earnings per share guidance of $2.40 to $2.80 and operating cash flow of $300 million to $500 million. We were updating certain guidance targets as follows. For gross margin we are raising the high and low end of our guidance range by 1 percentage point to 18% to 19% reflecting improved visibility into self-developed project margin to the second half of the year. Largely offsetting the gross margin improvement is an increased in our operating expenses to range $380 million to $395 million. This increase is primarily to support ongoing technology and growth initiatives as well as to develop new markets. Additionally we are writing down our expected production by 100 megawatts to a range of 1.8 gigawatts to 1.9 gigawatts. The reduction is due to downtime required as we roll out production of our Series 4 modules. All other guidance range is to remain the same. And reaffirming our guidance is important to highlight a couple of key items. First, these ranges assume continuation of the current business model and therefore do not reflect the impact of the potential pursuit of the yieldco strategy. Any decision to pursue yieldco may significantly impact our ability to meet the earnings and operating cash flow guidance shown. Second the balance of the year, revenue and earnings is highly depended on our systems businesses and some key projects such as Solar Gen, Desert Sunlight and Topaz. Our guidance is based on the current assessment of the respected project status and understanding the dependency to deliver the anticipated revenue earnings and cash flow. However given the size of these projects, the inherent risk and the potential impact they can have on our 2014 guidance is proven as we highlighted. As we have stated previously, the project business can be lumpy relative to time. Now moving to slide 16, I\u2019d like to summarize our progress so far this year. First, we reached a new record sale efficiency of 21% and average efficiency, average fleet wide efficiency of 14%. The rate of improvement continues to increase and remain on track to our roadmap. Next with 812 megawatt DC of new bookings, our year-to-date bookings now stand at 1.2 gigawatts DC. These bookings combined with 1.3 gigawatt DC of mid to late-stage opportunities in our pipeline, give us confidence in our ability to meet 1 :1 book-to-bill ratio for the year and replenish our pipeline. Finally, from a financial standpoint, we\u2019re reiterating our full year earnings per share and cash flow guidance. Now with this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : We\u2019ll take our first question from Ben Kallo. Ben Kallo - Robert Baird : Hi, thanks for taking my question. First of all, as far as the guidance goes in the back half, could you discuss your visibility there the lumpiness of the business? And then second, you talked about YieldCos and market conditions, could you just talk about what decision process is right now with the successful YieldCos we\u2019ve seen? I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : Yes. I\u2019ll do the guidance discussion. So Ben really, there is not any really significant unknown dependency in the second half of the year. So if you look at it from a book and bill perspective, we\u2019re not at the highest dependency of new orders that have to be booked and bill between now and the end of the quarter or at the end of the year there is really no significant dependency from that perspective. The only dependency is just timing associated with a couple of the key projects that I mentioned. As we see each of those projects right now, we\u2019re comfortable with the timeline of recognizing the completion of those projects and the associated revenue earning and cash flows, but we just wanted to highlight it as such so that as you know the business can be lumpy and unanticipated events could occur. So, we thought it was prudent to highlight that. In terms of the YieldCos, I'll let Jim make some comments around that. Jim Hughes : I mean, I think the statement fairly stands on its own. The reference to market conditions is just really acknowledging that we're, they're going to be dramatic changes in market conditions, industrial appetite, obviously that could impact us narrowing, closing on a final decision. But the statement is pretty clear as to the timing of us getting to finish line on the decision making process. Operator : We'll go next to Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick Jobin - Credit Suisse : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the efficiency progress. A few quick questions, firstly you mentioned the inverter issue and causing to slip to Q3. Just want a little more color around that, and any cost associated with that? And then secondly back on the YieldCo question. How are you thinking about necessarily decision go, no go, but the amount of projects if you could put into YieldCo looking out over the next few years? Thank you. Jim Hughes : Well first on the Desert Sunlight inverter issue. It is a very esoteric engineering issue that manifested itself only when the plant came up to full power. There is an engineering solution that can be implemented. It is not material to the company as a whole, but delay was primarily in a green documentation to cover it with the customer and it\u2019s not something that we're particularly alarmed about. It's sometime when you bring these very large plants up to full power, you have issues of almost resonance between the inverters that manifest themselves. We've seen it with other classes of inverters in the past. It just requires some engineering hours and it\u2019s not something we're particularly concerned about. And on the YieldCo, in terms of details, one we haven't reach the decision and two, I don't think we're prepared to discuss details other than to say, we're obviously close observers of the marketplace. We know what characteristic it takes to have a successful offering and a company that trades successfully in the marketplace and it's not something we would even be considering unless we felt we have the capability to deliver those characteristics. Mark Widmar : And I think Jim referenced this even on our Analyst Day when you look at our project pipeline, it's not a question of capability of having the project and the pipeline and then we just highlighted, we've added more to the pipeline over this last quarter. So, the capabilities there is just to completing our analysis and conclusion around strategic fit and the direction we want to go. Operator : We'll go next to Shahriar Pourreza with Citi. Shahriar Pourreza - Citi: Hey Jim and Mark. Just a quick two part question here outside from asking a question on YieldCo. The efficiencies on your sales are increasing at a real rapid pace. I'm sort of wondering if you could just give us sort of refreshed view on you can take the average efficiencies for crystal and silicon panels, what is the LCOE stand when you compare yourself to crystal and silicon and thin film. And then the second part of my question is, is that clearly we're starting to see the end of some very large RFP announcements in states like the Carolinas, Georgia, several states, non-traditional coal burning states. Can you maybe just give a little bit of an update if possible and if you're gaining any traction on some of these other states that should be announcing large scale utility RFPs? Jim Hughes : Let me start with the second half of your question and then I'll hand up to Mark for the first part. In terms of the activities in primarily the Southeast and United States, I think we're in the heat of the battle right now and we'll begin to have a little more visibility as we move over the next probably 60 days to 120 days, but we're certainly very active as within a new market, we have a lot of learning to do in terms of what the winning combination is going to be. And we have very good partnerships and deep relationships that we're working in that region. So, we're cautiously optimistic, but I think a lot of detail will play out over the next 60 days to 120 days. And we often get two opportunities to look at the business, one during the sort of developer RFP stage and then two as a module and EPC supplier on the back end. So, we expect to be busy with all of those activities, for an extended period of time. Mark Widmar : On the efficiency and relative impact of kind of our cell technology as Jim indicated in his comments is our cell efficiency is now above both (inaudible) as well as crystal silicon. And as you know Shahriar the relative advantage of our temperature co-efficient creating greater separation from that standpoint. So if you look at the entitlement from the cell level couple that with our advantage in efficiency as well as other aspects such as humidity and other environments where we performed better than our competition, we clearly will be at an entitlement level that is superior to our competitor relative to capability. The slide that we have in the presentation as far as the energy density is the probably the best near term process where we are. And as that slide shows Jim indicated as we step from call it 12% to 13% disadvantage as we sit today and we exit the year around 5% build on energy density and then it starts to expand beyond that where it become advantageous it will be on 2015 that\u2019s directly correlated to all the improvements that we have been talking about. We haven\u2019t given a specific LCE entitlement relative to that roadmap but it\u2019s clearly the understanding of our capability and competitiveness of our technology. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to James Medvedeff with Cowen and Company. James Medvedeff - Cowen and Company : Good afternoon and congratulations on the conversion efficiency that\u2019s a big number. Mark Widmar : Thank you. Jim Hughes : Thank you. James Medvedeff - Cowen and Company : Let\u2019s see here, can you say how much revenue was deferred or was not recognized that maybe had originally been expected to be recognized? Jim Hughes : No, I mean we haven\u2019t given revenue guidance and obviously, but we\u2019re not going to say how much was deferred. But clearly it was a meaningful amount, if you want to look at it as a percentage of relative expectation we realized about a third of what we were anticipating to recognize that is the third of what we anticipated to recognized in the quarter and that drove a meaningful impact around earnings. But again it\u2019s a timing issue, there is no lot economics it\u2019s a matter of revenue and earnings falling out to the second quarter as we\u2019ll see that realization in the third quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Mark Strauss - JPMorgan: Yes, hi. This is Mark Strauss on for Paul. Thanks for taking our questions. I just wanted to see if you could comment on I understand it\u2019s pretty early but any changes in the competitive environment in the U.S. just given some of the preliminary terrace that have been put on the Chinese guys? Jim Hughes : I think it\u2019s way too early to say that we\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive environment, as you probably know we were not a party to the trade case and have not focused on it as being a particularly strong driver of our business. The last imposition, our competition found efficient way to work around the duties fairly quickly and it's not in clear the main that they won't find the ways to work around many. So we continue to believe that we have to be prepared to compete on a fairly unassisted straight up basis in that how we run the business, still. I don't really, I can't really say that we've seen an impact today. Operator : We'll go next to Stephen Chin of UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS: Hi guys. Congrats on the strong booking for the quarter. Jim Hughes : Thank you. Stephen Chin - UBS: I think the first question just around the margin expansion. So it's good to see margins taking higher. Was the emphasize for this higher ASPs Q2, kind of lower cost of capital you're seeing indeed projects finance, equity purchase market. And how does that differentiate it's mean yourself to follow-up projects and your third-party booking, our margin, are you also seeing margins expand there was these stable. What is your outlook for the two going forward? Jim Hughes : Yes. We think it's a two pieces of that. And so clearly when you think about our self developed projects, we've been highlighted a little bit of this in the Analyst Day that cost of capital clearly has become a more competitive. Strategic are getting more comfortable with the risk profile of the PB assets and therefore becoming more competitive as they think about the rolling us to acquire projects and but therefore reflects in cost of capital subject. So we're seeing that to our searching we're continuing to see now even with some of the (inaudible) market or others concerned potentially that yieldcos will be alternative avenues to monetize those projects you are seeing others become more competitive and particularly for large utilities projects that people want to acquire. On the EPC side we really don\u2019t necessarily see when we compete on a third party see that the cost of capital accretion largely goes to the owner or developer of the project, but our technology the only real comparison our technology has increased or is highlighted in kind of the slide that we show. So as we price forward third party EPC agreements we are seeing better margin realization which is more indicative of the capability and the strength of the technology and the cost curve that we have been able to achieve versus cost of capital advantages that EPC provider may capture in the marketplace. Operator : We will go next to Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs :  Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. I guess first off Mark you mentioned during your prepared remarks growing more assets on the balance sheet. How many megawatts does that comprise today that are completed and how much would you expect that to be by the end of 2014? And then my follow up would be just generally on yieldcos. You sort of alluded to this but wondering how you guys are thinking about the emergence of yieldcos impacting pricing in the project acquisition environment and then in what sort of timeframe if are not already seeing it today you might expect this to see that impact? Thanks. Mark Widmar :  So the way I would look at it Brian. If you look at it across in our portfolio of project opportunities that has not been sold yet, it\u2019s approximately 1.5 gigawatts of opportunities that we have. It go across various time line. Some of that is near-term actively either completed held on balance sheet or in some form of construction or development and I would say look at about 600 megawatts, we fall into that category. The others would have duty days that are in kind of the \u201816 timeline and then we have a couple of 100 megawatt that go beyond that. So, when you look across that portfolio of assets and then the inherent cash flows that are embedded in those assets, you have more than above cash flows to not only do your initial launch, but to have a pretty attractive development pipeline that sits behind those assets and we're continuing to compete on a day-to-day basis the asset, the pipeline of opportunity. So, the question is do we have the capability. I think we highlighted that in the Analyst Day last year or this year I should say that we clearly do, when you see our filing that comes tomorrow you will see the summary of the projects that adds ups about 1.5 gig. And so yes, the capability is clearly there more or less our own internal assessment of what the right strategic fit direction we want to go. Operator : We'll go next to Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Just want to ask about reduced production guidance, introduction of new models, modules this year. Do you guys expect to increase your efficiency road map in next year and forward based on the mix change here? Jim Hughes : The reduction in guidance this year is due to downtime associated with the implementation of some of the elements up road map that were provided to investors at our recent Analyst Day. Some of it is because we have accelerated or broadened the roll out programs beyond what we originally would have anticipated. It isn't change to the overall technology road map. The numbers we have presented at the last Analyst Day remain our most recent guidance in terms of our technology road map going forward. It's really more just a change, sudden change in the timing of some of the roll out that impacted the total production for this year. As you begin to roll the technology across your production lines you may see opportunities to perhaps do things a little more simultaneously and the trade office,, you get the efficiency benefit earlier. But you lose a little bit of production in the process and we\u2019re constantly doing a cross benefit analysis to compare the various ways to roll that technology across our production line and then that impact to this year was a reduction of 100 megawatts. But it\u2019s not any big change, it\u2019s basically on schedule with what we\u2019ve disclosed at the last Analyst Day, it doesn\u2019t reflect any sort of major deviation from that plan. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Aditya Satghare with FBR Capital Markets. Aditya Satghare - FBR Capital Markets : Thank you. Two questions please from my side. So, firstly, could you just talk about the market environment in two international markets which you\u2019re active in, Japan and Chile and maybe for the contrast between the environment of self developed projects versus the third party modules? Jim Hughes : Sure. So let\u2019s start with Chile it\u2019s a little bit simpler. So, the only thing wrong with the Chilean market is transition constraints in overall market size otherwise it\u2019s a very robust market. So we expect an early position in the market with the projects that we\u2019re currently pursuing, most of that activity for us is self developed. We do have some third party negotiations that are underway, but the largest percentage is self-developed. The market will continue to grow but at a measured pace primarily because the overall size of the electricity system is modest and you are reaching a point where you will hit transmission constraints ultimately those constraints will be relieved but that requires the investment and construction but they show infrastructure. So it's a nice little market, but it is constrained in terms of its total impact by the overall size of the market, but we\u2019re very happy with what we\u2019ve got accomplished and we\u2019ll continue to have a presence in that market. Japan is a more complicated and dramatically larger market. There are multiple channels that we can pursue. You have the so called mega solar or the large utility scale projects, you have the smaller scale distributed projects and then you have the very small scale distributed rooftop projects spanning both residential, commercial and industrial and then the mega solar. We have multiple efforts underway on the mega solar, we\u2019re both pursuing our own development efforts, we\u2019re also working alongside of third-party developers on a partnership basis and there are multiple of those partnerships that we\u2019re pursuing or are actively engaged in. On the more distributed side, we\u2019ve been looking to work with channel partners, the most notable of which is the XSOL announcement that we recently made, signing distribution deal with them for a total of 100 megawatts with 20 megawatts of that being take or pay. So we're beginning to penetrate the various channel that are available to us. We've also have a commitment with JX Nippon on the TetraSun product, which is commencing production this year out of Malaysia. So we had a multitude of efforts underway in the Japanese market and that is a very large market that we expect to see strong growth out of for many years to come. There are certainly steps being taken to rain in the FIT. That\u2019s not unexpected; it has served its purpose in terms of generating early activity. We have taken a long term view of the market and believe that solar is going to be an important part of the energy mix long after the FIT fades away simply because it is very competitive with their alternative forms of energy. So, we see it as a very steady growth opportunity for many years in the future and that\u2019s kind of how we think about Japan. Operator :  We will go next to Colin Rusch with Northland Capital Markets. Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets :  Great. Thanks so much. Can you just help us reconcile side seven and eight? It looks like you had some nice bookings post 2Q with 700 megawatts or so. But when you go to slide eight, you were looking at the year-to-date additions, not really changing so much post 2Q, so you just walk us through are there some debookings that are happening, is there some pricing dynamics there? And then as a follow up, I would love to just get an update on the combined solar and diesel generation sell-through, how that\u2019s looking at this point? Jim Hughes :  Sure. So, on the combined solar and diesel sell-through we continue to have lots of good activity talking to a large number of potential customers, also talking to the technology partners on the diesel side because we don\u2019t anticipate getting into the diesel business. We\u2019ll want to have a partner for that aspect of it. Those sales are a very long cycle sale but just generally you are dealing with a customer that has a record self generation of electricity as a critical component of some industrial or production process i.e. mining companies or remote industrial locations. And we think the sales cycle will include small pilot projects that demonstrate the technology and demonstrate the reliability and availability of the technology and then you will be able to grow the business as you move forward. We've moved from conversations and theoretical discussions to beginning to discuss specific pilots and we remain pretty confident that it's going to be an attractive business, but it is a very long sales cycle and we're still at the early stages of that cycle.0 Mark Widmar : The other question, the slide seven versus slide eight, what we did in slide seven is that we just showed discretely because I think people asked the question before about of the total bookings that we show because we do take the bookings up until the time of the earnings call, but how much of that in the specific quarter, how much was after the quarter. So, slide seven just says okay within the boundaries of Q2, we booked 500 megawatts. And then after that, we've booked another 700 megawatts. So, those two are broken out. On slide eight, we just didn't break it out, we just showed combined 1.2 gigawatts, translates to 1.6 billion of revenue. So, it's just slightly different way of our presentation, but the way you should look at and if you want to compare it to that 0.5 and 0.7 that in aggregate adds up to 1.6 billion of revenue as I add to the pipeline. Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets :  Yes. And 400 megawatts in Q1, so, the 500\u2026 Mark Widmar : Yes. Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets : So, the 500 includes that 400. Mark Widmar : Yes. Operator : We'll go next to Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben Kallo - Robert W. Baird: Hey, thanks for the follow-up. I think that it's probably one of the best periods you\u2019ve had from bookings. Could you just update us, is it something we should expect going forward; is there an acceleration in your pipeline as you guys develop these things parallel or how should we think about going forward? Jim Hughes : I think you should think that it's a very good period and we certainly hope it\u2019s representative of a trend but we\u2019ve seen quarter-to-quarter variability in the activity and it\u2019s not always easy to predict. We tend to look at the combination of metrics that we provide to you guys to together appeal for how the business is trending. And as you\u2019ve seen over the last year and half that opportunities pipeline has grown; I think it\u2019s doubled over the last 18 months or so. And I think we\u2019re beginning to see as the full cycle flows out that much larger set of opportunities is beginning to translate into bookings which is what you would expect. I don\u2019t want to promise a steady rhythm because it\u2019s simply not the nature of the business, but I think it is indicative of that we\u2019re beginning to convert that very large pipeline is beginning to filter through down to the finish line and we\u2019re seeing higher activity levels as a result. It\u2019s also in part generated by we\u2019re broadening our applicable market as our technology evolves and as conversion efficiency increases, opportunities that would have been where we would not have been competitive because of space constraints or other elements that required a greater efficiency, we\u2019re beginning to compete effectively in those -- in that addressable market. That also generates an overall higher level of activity which some of which translates through into bookings. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of them. By the way first, congrats on the great cell efficiency improvement. Along the path, as cad-tell technology improves, I am kind of curious, do you have any update on TetraSun and what are your plans for the technology? And then my second question is not to bore you with another YieldCo question but if you do decide to go on the top become to the non-solar projects or really to look out that solar? Thank you very much. Unidentified Company Representative : First on TetraSun, TetraSun remains on track as for the kind of the business plan that we outlined for investors at our Analyst Day, we're working on commencing production in Malaysia, the initial market remains Japan through along which (inaudible) we are booking at opportunities across a variety of other markets and we continue to see a roll and opportunity for TetraSun in highly space constraint circumstances or very high deal circumstances or at a very high efficiencies are work incrementally higher costs associated with TetraSun. But there is no doubt that the success we've had on that front has taken pressure off of the need to move TetraSun at a very rapid pace. So it remains on traction is continuing to be pursued along the business line that we outlined. But the distance between the two technologies has unquestionably narrowed and that takes a little bit of the sense of urgency out of it at quite frankly. But we're fully committed and spending lots of time in R&D dollars and marketing dollars on not only developing the technology, but finding the appropriate channels where we can take advantage of the unique characteristics of that product. And then on the yieldco its way through with comments on assets other than our own and assets outside of solar, we need to get the finish line on whether we want to consider it with our core assets before we address those questions. Operator : We'll go next to Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank :  Hi thanks for taking my question. As you were evaluating a yieldco decision I am assuming you have been approached by other yieldco companies to take a look at some of these projects that you have on balance sheet, just relative to say six ago where do you think pricing is today for some of these projects is it up 20%, 30%? And has that changed the outlook for developers looking at some of these projects over the next two, three years I mean are you seeing an increasing risk appetite and as a result of that a greater amount of activity in the U.S. and global markets? And just secondly when you think about the 21% efficiency cell what kind of cost per watt would that translate into and when can you start manufacturing that technology? Thank you very much. Mark Widmar :  Let me start with the last first, with respect to the 21% technology as I referenced in my opening comments it\u2019s right on the glide slope that we laid out in our last Analyst Day with respect to our technology roadmap and all the comment that we are going to provide about cost per watt is contained in that analyst day presentation, so I would reference you to that presentation Vish nothing unexpected in the announcement, it\u2019s merely confirmation that we are executing the roadmap that we set forth earlier this year. And then with respect to other yieldcos and impact on pricing in the marketplace those that have been following the company since I joined, I have been talking about yieldcos and the cost of capital within the sector relative to other competing forms of generation for nearly two years now and everything that has played out has been pretty much as I expected. There is no reason that an investor should or would differentiate between the cash flows is coming off, of the fully contracted power plant versus a wind plant versus a thermal plant. In many respects, it's actually safer and more stable class of assets than those others. So, we have seen a steady and consistent reduction in capital cost for the sector for completed projects that obviously increases the value of any project these cash flows are contracted at one given level of profit capital and it's certainly has allowed developers in the marketplace that are bidding for PPAs to bid a more aggressive cost of capital and assume that they can maintain the development margin for themselves given that cost of capital. So, it translates through the entire value chain all the way and a great deal if not all the benefit ultimately ends up in the hands of the customers, also really the customers have the utilities that contract for the power. So, it has resulted in a steady lower in a way and cost of generated solar power for the customer and that's not a surprise that's something we have been talking about for a year and half. And we think that it's appropriate and puts solar into that position to compete as a main stream participant in the overall generation mix particularly in North America. Operator : We'll take our final question from Edwin Mok with Needham and Company. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company: Great. Thanks for squeezing me. So my question is on mid to late stake options if you had to laid out there, how much was that is international versus U.S.? And then my quick follow-up just on the question regarding the Chinese tariff, the Chinese module and how that has impact to market we\u2019ve heard from some other company talking about EPCTA still in project construction as a result those tariff have you seen that in the marketplace will that create opportunity for you to build on some of those projects? Jim Hughes : We have not seen any evidence of that in the marketplace and whether we will, I simply don\u2019t know maybe we will just have to see what happens. Mark Widmar : On the first one in terms of mid to late stage and then what is the mix of that by geography we don\u2019t break that out per say. But I think the best way to look at it is a relatively diverse mix. I think one of the things we did highlighted in the call was that included in that mid to late stage 1.3 gigawatts was our Luz del Norte project in Chile which is a 141 megawatt DC, so as again they ramp a large scale project that sits in the late mid to late stage project portfolio and one which we near-term. So it\u2019s a good mix, great thing we\u2019ve been adding to our BD capacity and PD capacity on a global basis. We\u2019ve been able to penetrate a number of new markets and pipelines are being very robust in those markets and you\u2019re starting to see some of that mid to late stage pipeline that we referenced. Operator : That does conclude our conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer Jim? Jim Hughes : Thanks Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Let me begin by providing an update on the progress we've made on our manufacturing and technology roadmaps. First with expectations for robust demand next year we have recently begun restarting before the idle lines of capacity at our Malaysia facility. The restart of these lines will add over 360 megawatts of capacity in 2015. Additionally we have started deploying existing toolsets to add two new lines of capacity in our Perrysburg, Ohio facility. The additional lines will be operational around midyear 2015 and provide over 100 megawatts of output next year combined with improved throughput on existing lines our manufacturing capacity not including TetraSun has the potential to increase up to 46% next year depending upon demand levels. Turning to efficiency our full fleet average conversion efficiency for the quarter was 14.2% at 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter. In the fourth quarter we expect our full fleet to average 14.4% conversion efficiency compared to the 14.9% Q4 fleet average efficiency we communicated at Analyst Day, the difference is not technology related but primarily due to a change in assumed product mix. Currently based on customer requirements we are producing more Series 3 modules and our transition to Series 4 upgraded with our anti-reflective technology coating has been delayed as a result. In addition we have made certain enhancements which do not increase the conversion efficiency but improves the overall stability and energy density of our modules and which increased the energy yield that at the system level, taken together these items account for the difference in our current forecast versus what we communicated earlier this year. We continue to be encouraged by the progress of our CadTel technology, for example recent pre-production runs of significant volume incorporating our latest device improvements have resulted in conversion efficiencies of up to 15.9%, while these improvements are not scheduled to rollout across the fleet until next year this is an example of the progress we continue to make on our technology knowledge roadmap. Slides 5 and 6 show the total outstanding bookings in gigawatts and revenue and the change in those bookings that occurred in the third quarter, this data represents our total business which includes third party module sales. Total outstanding bookings stands at 3.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of 100 megawatts from the prior quarter. We've added new bookings of over 500 megawatts and our year-to-date bookings as of today's call are now above 1.7 gigawatts. Bookings through the end of September were 1.6 gigawatts compared to shipments of 1.1 gigawatts during that time period resulting in a book-to-bill ratio for the first three quarters of the year of about 1.5. Our goal is to achieve a greater than 1 to 1 book-to-bill ratio and with our recent progress we are on track to meet or exceed this target. The single largest booking in the quarter was 141 megawatt AC Luz del Norte project located in Chile which had not been included in our bookings number prior to this point. Since the update we provided last quarter the project has now reached financial close and construction is underway. In the UK we announced earlier today along with BELECTRIC, the groundbreaking of a 46 megawatt DC utility scale power plant in Southern England. This is the fourth project to be executed in the UK under the First Solar and BELECTRIC joint venture that we announced last year. In addition this past quarter our bookings have demonstrated progress in the South Eastern United States with two project announcements in North Carolina's, that\u2019s part of the Duke Energy RFP. First we have signed an EPC agreement to construct the 40 megawatt AC Elm City project, additionally First Solar was announced as the module provider to the 65 megawatt AC Warsaw Solar project which will be the largest solar power plant east of the Mississippi River once completed. Both projects will be owned and operated by Duke Energy. Our bookings in the quarter also showed ongoing geographical diversity with about 42% of bookings from outside the United States. In addition to the projects in Chile and the UK already mentioned, we also recorded bookings in other parts of Europe, Israel and India. Turning to outstanding bookings in revenue terms our expected revenue decreased from 7.5 billion to 7.4 billion reflecting a higher mix of module and module plus volume booked in the quarter. We're seeing increasing demand for our module plus offering which combines a module with the mounting solution and component warranty. Well some offerings may generate less revenue than a full system we will continue to provide the best solution that meets the customers' needs while maximizing the gross margin dollars from each sale. Turning to slide 7, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which now stands at 13.7 gigawatts DC, an increase from 12.7 in the prior quarter. The approximately 1 gigawatt increase in new opportunities is due to continued growth in the U.S., Latin America and India. In the U.S. the growth continues to be driven by strong demand across the country driven in part by the exploration of the investment tax credit in 2016. The size of our mid and late stage deals which have a moderate to high probability of success was down slightly to 1 gigawatt resulting from the bookings recorded in the quarter. Slide 8 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America has increased to 7.7 gigawatts or 56% of the total, included in our international opportunity and late stage deals is the recently announced 80 megawatt AC project awarded in Andhra Pradesh, India. Once the PPA is signed on this project it will be counted as a booking this project highlights the momentum we continue to see in our international bookings opportunities. Finally turning to the often asked question of the YieldCo, the company has determined that we are not prepared to file a registration statement and pursue a listed yield vehicle at this time. However we have also determined that the ownership and operation of whole or partial interest in select solar generating assets does have a role as a component part of our overall business model. We will continue to develop generation assets in the U.S. and select other markets and at times we will retain either a whole or partial interest in such assets. As with any asset class we will continue to evaluate our options for the capitalization and governance of such assets. We feel that opportunities for maturation of the marketplace and further optimization of such retained interest remain and have decided to exercise patience. We likely will begin providing greater visibility into our retained ownership interest by reporting it as a separate segment commencing in 2015 as it will have become a material contributor by such time. You can anticipate that we will provide a more detailed financial overview at our traditional Analyst Day in early 2015. Now I will turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our Q3 financial results and discuss guidance for 2014. Mark Widmar : All right, thanks Jim and good afternoon. Turning to slide 10 I will begin by highlight the operational performance for the third quarter, production in the quarter was 449 megawatts DC which was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and 5% higher year-over-year due to higher module efficiency on the same number of production lines. Our factory capacity utilization was 77% down 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. Factory utilization was down sequentially due to the rollout of our anti-reflective coating technology. The average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.2% in the third quarter which is up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 90 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line ran up at 14.3% efficiency during the quarter and increased of approximately 20 basis points from the prior quarter. In line with what we communicated on our last quarters call, our lead line efficiency has continued to rapidly improve. During the month of October our lead line efficiency average 14.6%, an improvement of 70 basis points over October of last year. Lastly our module manufacturing cost per watt declined again this quarter due to both efficiency and material cost improvements. During Q3, we achieved a milestone with our fleet average cost per watt excluding utilization below $0.40 per watt. Note this includes freight, warranty and EOL cost as well. Now moving to the P&L portion of the presentation on slide 11, net sales in the third quarter were $889 million compared to 544 million last quarter, the increase is due to higher revenue recognition on our Desert Sunlight Project and various other systems projects under construction. As highlighted last quarter an unexpected inverter system integration issue resulted in the revenue recognition delay on Desert Sunlight. This integration issue has been resolved and the project is on track for completion in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the revenue increase from the Desert Sunlight project was the sale of 50 megawatt AC Macho Spring project in Q3 which was accounted for on a completed contract basis. In addition revenue recognition on our Topaz Project was lower quarter-over-quarter as the project nears completion. As a percentage of total net sales our systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the systems [ph] project was 95%, an increase of 7 percentage points from the prior quarter reflecting third quarter \u2013 reflecting lower third party module sales. Gross margin in the third quarter was 21.3% a sequential increase of 430 basis points. The increase in gross margin percent was due to the higher revenue recognition on the Desert Sunlight project and the lower mix of module business in Q3. Third quarter operating expenses increased $15 million quarter-over-quarter to a 106 million. The increase is mainly a result of higher R&D spending related to the ongoing roll out of the efficiency improvement programs, TetraSun startup costs and higher project development costs as we work to develop the international market opportunities. On a reported basis, third quarter operating income was 84 million compared to 2 million in Q2. The increase was due to higher sales and gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Third quarter GAAP net income was 88 million or $0.87 per fully diluted share compared to $0.04 per fully diluted share in the second quarter. The third quarter results included a onetime tax benefit of $0.26 per share associated with the exploration of the statute of limitations on a discreet uncertain tax position. Adjusted for this onetime item, earnings per share for the quarter would've been $0.61. Turning to slide 12, I will review the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities decreased by approximately $234 million to $1.1 billion, our net cash position decreased to just under 900 million. The decrease in cash was expected as we continue to build Solar Gen 2 and self-developed projects on balance sheet in the third quarter. Consistent with our prior communications we will continue to build projects through substantial completion on balance sheet which will increase our options to optimize the value of the project. Our net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased by approximately 234 million from the prior quarter. The increase was due to reduction in current liabilities resulting from revenue recognition on Desert Sunlight and an increase in inventory. Our debt increased by 23 million in the third quarter with 56 million of the increase related to the funding of the construction of our 141 megawatt AC Luz del Norte project. As a reminder in Q2 the OPIC Board approved a loan of up to 230 million and the IFC Board approved the $60 million loan to support construction of Luz del Norte, the financing closed in Q3 and we received the initial funding under these loans. The increase was partially offset by payments on our related debt facilities. Our restricted cash including both current and noncurrent increased a 118 million sequentially primarily from the debt procedure related to Luz del Norte construction and from an approximate 61 million First Solar equity contribution to the project. While the 61 million will be used over time to construct the project it has an immediate impact in our ending third quarter cash balance of 1.1 billion. Also as we have communicated on last quarter's call, our restricted cash balance include 73 million of cash used to collateralize and significantly reduced the cost of certain letters of credit. This restricted cash remained highly liquid and can be converted back to unrestricted cash in five days. Cash flow used in operations was $47 million compared to cash flow from operations of $180 million in Q2. Free cash flow was a negative of 107 million compared to positive free cash flow of 60 million in the prior quarter. While operating cash flow was negative for the quarter we continue to build certain products on balance recognizing the higher return potential and optionality this provides to our investors. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $71 million, an increase from $62 million in the prior quarter as we purchase more equipment needed for efficiency programs, the TetraSun product ramp and our Perrysburg manufacturing capacity expansion. Appreciation for the quarter was $60 million compared to $63 million in the prior quarter. Turning to slide 13, I will now discuss our guidance for the remainder of 2014. First we are again reaffirming in our earnings per share guidance of $2.40 to $2.80 and operating cash flow of 300 million to 500 million. Other guidance targets are updated as follows, first we are lowering our net sales range of 100 million to 3.6 billion to 3.9 billion, the revised range reflects a delay in revenue on certain self-developed projects as we have elected to hold them longer than originally anticipated in order to capture incremental value. For gross margin we're raising the high and low end of our guidance range by 1 percentage point to 19% to 20% reflecting the improved pricing environment for self-developed projects and especially as it relates to our Solar Gen 2 project which was sold in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the gross margin improvement as an increase in operating expenses to a range of 390 million to 40 million, this increase captures the higher OpEx in our third quarter results and reflects greater investment in our technology and new markets. The low end of our operating income guidance has increased by 10 million to 300 million to 340 million reflecting the improvements in gross margin which is partially offset by the higher operating expenses. As expected tax rate is being narrowed to 18% to 20% based on improved visibility and to the mix of jurisdictional income for the full year. Note that this tax rate does not reflect the onetime tax benefit of $0.26 per share recognized in Q3. Lastly we are lowering our capital expenditures range to 250 million to 300 million resulting from the timing of equipment purchases falling into next year. Relative to our operating cash flow guidance, it is noteworthy to highlight an important dependency. As noted previously our Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects are nearing completion. We anticipate reaching substantial completion on both of these projects in Q4 at which point we will invoice the amounts retained by our customers as a form of security until the project is completed. These payments are expected to be received late in Q4. If we\u2019re unable to collect these funds in a timely manner we may not be able to achieve the cash flow guidance range of 300 million to 500 million, however note, it is important to highlight this is just a timing issue between Q4 of 2014 and Q1 of 2015. Finally our guidance assumes we sell 100% of the interest of Solar Gen. As communicated in announcement on the sale to Southern subject to certain terms and conditions we may retain a minority interest in the project. If we elect to do this it will most likely result in achieving the low end or potentially slightly below the revenue earnings and cash flow guidance. Now moving onto slide 14, I would like to summarize our progress so far this year. First in terms of efficiency, we continue to demonstrate a consistent rate of improvement, our lead line averaging 14.6% in October and preproduction value using our latest efficiency programs running at 15.9% we're demonstrating our ability to execute this roadmap. Next with our bookings of 521 megawatt DC, our year-to-date bookings now stand at over 1.7 gigawatts DC. These bookings combined with 1 gigawatt of mid to late stage opportunities in our pipeline give us confidence in our ability to meet or even exceed our one-to-one book ratio for the year and replenish our pipeline. From a financial standpoint we\u2019re confirming our full-year earnings per share and cash flow guidance. With this we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster \u2013 JPMorgan: Jim, the flexibility that you are giving yourself in a terms of production capacity next year is quite dramatic really isn't it? What is it that you are seeing that makes you want to have this potential capacity available for next year? Jim Hughes : Well I think it's not a mystery to everybody that the potential exploration or actually step down of the investment tax credit in the United States market at the end of 2016 continues to pull demand forward and so we want to maximize our ability to capture some of that demand. In addition a number of our international markets are performing very well and we continue to see demand to begin to emerge and manifest itself in those markets and again we want to be in a position to capture that demand to what the extent the early signs we are seeing today continue to develop. So it is basically just reflective of a bottoms up view of what we are seeing in the market over really the next 18 months. Operator : Our next question is from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird: How do you view the overall market with capacity expansions versus you guys expanding capacity and how you\u2019re weighing that and then could you just touch on the YieldCo decision and what factored into postponing it or if it's postponing or it just not doing it altogether? Thanks so much. Jim Hughes : Sure so in terms of overall capacity there is quite a bit of capacity that is being added to the marketplace right now. And I think our general view is you continue to see a bit of imbalance between supply and demand from an overall capacity standpoint. Having said that I think the market clearly tiers into the higher quality, higher level producers and the lower level producers and different parts of the market have different levels of imbalance. I will say that I think we do have a note of caution about the overall market position as we exit 2016 and move into 2017. The demand that we're pulling forward into 2016 broadly, well we think will result in the slowdown in '17. Now from our standpoint when we do a bottoms up analysis of our opportunities we have more than enough international opportunities that are filling in to replace that but you can't ignore the fact that on a global basis there are a number of markets that look like they could see a decline over the same time period that capacity is getting added so we are cautiously watching to make sure we are not headed into another period of excess capacity. So we\u2019re cognizant that an argument could be made that there is some risk of that. With respect to the YieldCo decision I make essentially we do not feel like that we are missing either gross margin opportunities or market share capture opportunities because we don\u2019t have a YieldCo today. As we have consistently said we\u2019re self-developing projects and those projects continue to be lucrative assets for us. We are keeping those projects on our balance sheet through the commercial operations date and in certain circumstances we are retaining an interest in those projects where we think it makes sense. We may revisit it at some point but when we look at where all of the capital market sit today, where everybody sits today the results we have seen in the marketplace we don\u2019t feel like we are constraining our business by continuing to maintain an optionality type of position, a patient position with respect to that. And I think it's as simple as that. Mark Widmar : And the other thing I will just add just on the capacity side of it, since we got two questions on this as well. I think the other think we need to connect the dots on as we continue to highlight the progress that we have made around our technology and efficiency roadmap and the cost profile and as we said before as the competitiveness of our technology is increased over time, we would anticipate that we would capture a higher percentage share of the market and I think what's happening is in-line with our previous statements in that regard. We have made the enhancements around the technology; it's becoming more and more competitive than the market. It's creating an element of differentiation and the value proposition that resonates very well with a number of our key customers and it's capturing itself in incremental market share. With that though as, Jim indicated, we will continue to be very disciplined with an awareness of understanding of the oversupply that could be in the market. We will make sure that demand is as complete visibility before the capacity will be added. Operator : Our next question is from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup Global Markets. Shar Pourreza \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets : Jim, just two quick questions here. First one, is there any, you mentioned on projects, RFPs in the South East, is there any update on the Georgia RFPs that are currently happening? And then maybe you could just comment on sort of where your cost of capital advantage is when there is a YieldCo involved, I think you\u2019ve highlighted before in the past that it's become a little bit more challenging when there is a YieldCo involved given the fact that they could have a more of a cost of capital advantage. Jim Hughes : Let us start with the latter and then I will defer to Mark, I'm not sure I have the latest information that we have made public on Georgia. But with respect to, a lot of the activity that we are seeing in the marketplace that\u2019s very aggressive is not actually on behalf of YieldCo's, it's on behalf of developers speculating as to the price YieldCo's are willing to pay. We haven't actually seen any of our competitors that have YieldCo's behave in what we view as a significantly undisciplined fashion and pay discount rates that aren't reflective sort of the appropriate risk-adjusted rates, that in part is a component part of our decision. If it was facilitating pricing decisions on the part of others responsible other players that we thought was disadvantaging us, then we would have an urgent need to do something but that\u2019s not what we perceive. There is pricing on the market that we don\u2019t think is rational and we think there will be some disappointment in certain quarters. But we are not going to chase it to the bottom, we\u2019re going to look at what we think are rational, disciplined capital decisions and we were comfortable that our business is going to continue to perform with rational disciplined capital decisions. Mark, you got anything on Georgia? Mark Widmar : Yes, just on the cost of capital discussion as well, I think maybe it's important as we indicated in the script here as well as in prior announcements we did make a decision to sell Solar Gen 2 to Southern. We took that asset out to market about 4-5 months ago and we included all of the YieldCos in the process of evaluating of what the value of that asset was and the best value came back from a non-YieldCo. So at Jim's point, we're not seeing in the market at this point in time the YieldCos coming up with an advantage cost of capital relative to some of our other partners that we\u2019ve sold to. However, we\u2019re seeing a different behavior in some cases with developers speculating as Jim indicated, with potentially what the cost to capital that they could realize associated with their development assets. On Georgia, we haven't made any public announcements on Georgia. We are in the process of some activities at this point in time that we may be able to make some comments here before the end of the quarter, but we haven't made any public statements at this point in time. Operator : Next we have Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin \u2013 UBS: Two quick questions, just a follow-up on the YieldCo or decision to not move forward with one. What does that mean exactly for yourself with all the projects going into 2015? Will you be pursuing equity sales you know sooner rather than later or with the idea that you may retain a whole or partial interest, are you still going to hold off for as long as you can before you commit to something? And just in terms of the capacity flexibility, what does that mean for efficiency for watt and/or cost structure as you reopen certain lines for the average kind of across your capacity? Thanks. Mark Widmar : I guess on the last one on the capacity side, yes the capacity it will help a little bit of the absorption of cost across the balance of the activities that we are idled, right. But we have been generally as we have talked to that, we have pulled that out as we refer to it as underutilization cost. However it will, on a holistic basis, we will benefit now from full absorption against that underutilization cost. So there will be a positive impact from that perspective. On the YieldCo and the decision we made around this, we will and two things we said in the stated strategy is that we will hold assets longer and we reiterated that a number of times in the script today. That is our intent. We will look to potentially sell a portion, all or maybe none of the asset we may choose to hold. And we will look to what makes the most sense and how do we capture the greatest value for the those assets. We have assets that are highly sought after and that are highly valued and we will look at every possible option to get the best returns for our shareholders. Operator : Next we have Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick Jobin \u2013 Credit Suisse : Simple one here, so you have alluded to some aggressive bidding by developers rightly or wrongly with their perceived view on where those assets could get bought at. So as I'm struggling to understand why that doesn\u2019t translate into some potential margin pressures for you if you are looking at winning those RFPs, so just help me understand the margin dynamics? And then lastly just any updates on TetraSun? Thanks. Jim Hughes : Sure. I think you have to consider the margin dynamics in the context of overall demand. So we\u2019re in a fairly robust demand environment where in contrast to a few years ago we have a bit of an ability to high-grade opportunities and that\u2019s what I mean when I say that we\u2019re not going to chase it to the bottom. So it's really in the context of the overall demand environment we have a little bit of a luxury. If those projects ultimately get sold or executed at aggressive pricing and if the overall demand picture is such that we\u2019re going to have to meet that obviously it would create pressure. I think our view at this point is we\u2019re skeptical that it reflects reality. And skeptical that that\u2019s the baseline against which we all have to operate but we will see \u2013 time will tell on that and you got to remember the cost curve continues to come down, so what's challenging today may be easy tomorrow. Operator : And our next question is from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah \u2013 Deutsche Bank : I wanted to just better understand the actual capacity of self-developed projects that you have on your balance sheet right now and what kind of cash that would be generating if you would do a YieldCo, and then at the same time could you just maybe talk about where you think the PPA prices are in the U.S. utility market right now versus the RFPs that you\u2019re looking at? Thank you. Mark Widmar : Yes on the first one in terms of capacity of the self-development assets that we have the balance sheet and what type of cash available for distribution would it be able to generate, let's just say that we probably have some of the premier assets in that regard and we would not have if we chose to do that and we believe it was the right decision to make our ability to hit minimum requirements as it relates to cash flow available for distribution or expectations around growth associated with that type of with the YieldCo type of structure, we would not have any challenge in terms of doing that. We have some very high-quality assets that we are currently developing. As it relates to PPA environment it does range, it depends on where you are in terms of what markets across the U.S. and in some cases everyone knows of the $0.05 type of price points that are happening across Texas and that is true. That is happening. We're seeing a higher pricing outside of that so far to the Southeast and now we see in some parts of the Southwest, but I would say you are probably still in the range of around $0.05 to $0.07 or so and on the lower end of that range I would think as Jim, indicated it's questionable whether some of those projects truly will be able to be executed. Time will tell, I think as time moves forward and as we continue to achieve the cost reductions in the efficiency improvements around our module, our overall ability to clear those types of market prices and do that with exceptional return on capital, changes in it is enhanced. In today's market those types of cost points can be very challenging. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee \u2013 Goldman Sachs : First off on the YieldCo, thought process, I know you talked about at high level, why you\u2019re coming to the decision right now that you are, but are there any company specific issues at play in terms of your ability to defer taxes or the potential to compete with some of your CadTel customers in the U.S., if you were to go down that route? And then secondarily, if I look at your international footprint some of your peers they seem to be gaining traction in China mostly through partnerships. You\u2019ve talked about this opportunity in the past, so just wondering if you can update us on where you stand in that market? How you might size it? And then your views on timing and economics versus some of the other overseas markets you are targeting. Thanks guys. Jim Hughes : Sure, so I will start with the last one first. So we\u2019ve always been very cautious about the expectations for the China market, while it's very large, execution is certainly challenging and margins also appear to be pretty thin. One of the biggest issues we have with respect to the China market from a development model standpoint is there is lots of curtailments of assets in that market and I think how that develops and what risks that represents gives a significant pause for concern. We have recently hired a new Country Manager. We do have efforts underway, but I would say that our highest grade efforts are elsewhere around the world as opposed to China and in the current opportunity set that we are disclosing, there is no significant China volumes in that opportunity set. So to the extent as we continue to look at the market we identify our strategy that we feel comfortable with, it would be accretive to everything that we have been presenting to-date. And then on the other questions about company specific issues on the YieldCo, I will let Mark address it. Mark Widmar : Yes, so I don't see it as any company specific issues that there are constraints as we\u2019re thinking about the opportunity. And your comment about whether \u2013 are there any inefficiencies or inabilities around the tax basis and potentially you\u2019re alluding to whether we would be able to trade a step up and be able to have the appropriate tax shields and anything else along those lines. Those aren't issues. The common as well around to create some type of conflict with some of our traditional customers, I don\u2019t see that really as being an issue either, if anything, every one of our traditional customers are trying to find ways to deepen their relationships and want to partner with us and they value the First Solar value proposition and the solutions that we can create for them and in some cases as we talk about partial retention of assets, it could be we would partner with traditional customer and then that retained interest that we would hold could be monetized either internally held as an internal asset that we monetize the cash flows over time. It could be held in some type of private YieldCo. it could be held in some kind of public YieldCo, so we have optimum flexibility in that regard with whatever we choose to do with those retained interest. But I would say the main thing is, (indiscernible) key customers that we have traditionally have done business with would prefer to find ways to deepen the relationship with us. Operator : And the next question is from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : First, I want to ask in terms of the system pricing in general for your projects, what are seeing on that market currently? What are the trends? Jim Hughes : Well I think we answered that at least in the U.S., as we indicated there is some pretty aggressive pricing in certain geographies which would be Texas probably on top of that list and other markets probably be more reasonable around expectations and what's happening in those markets. As you go across internationally it does very market by market but it should be no surprise that pricing in general across most of the jurisdictions are coming down over time, which you would expect as the technology improves the capability to achieve lower LCOEs. It also drives that elasticity of demand associated with it, so we\u2019re in an environment where prices are trending down not only here in the U.S. but internationally as well. And I think you should expect that to continue to happen and that\u2019s why it's important for us to drive our technology road map, drive cost reduction road map and to create solutions that we can efficiently get to market and do those at the lowest cost points possible. Sven Eenmaa \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : And second question I had, I mean you delayed some of the revenue recognition of the projects here from this year to next year. By holding them, what is the expectation in terms of additional gross margin dollar or earnings capture for you? Mark Widmar : I mean what's happening right now is in the market is, people are becoming more and more comfortable with the risk profile and are becoming more comfortable with how to value solar assets and so we had a couple of assets that we had thought initially, potentially to engage and try to sell into the market and advance the COD and partly because we wanted to test that market and see how the assets were being valued and we did see improvement in that regard. However, as we have seen now the results of the marketing that we have done particular around Solar Gen, we clearly believe the right thing to do is to hold these assets longer than we have done historically and what we were anticipating to do on a couple of smaller assets and so we will realize more significant economics by holding these assets and selling them next year. Operator : And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I had two margin related ones, the first one is can you quantify the margin benefit from selling an asset once fully built? Was this earlier in the development cycle? And the second part of it is, as your mix and the backlog shifts more internationally in other words, as it gets more international megawatts how should we expect the margins and the OpEx to trend? Mark Widmar : Well the rough order of magnitude of selling an asset let's say final notice to proceed versus selling the asset when it's fully built up an operational, we are generally seeing somewhere in the range of 50 basis points from an unlevered IRR basis which is meaningful as it relates to these assets . So we\u2019re \u2013 the trade-off of the query [ph] associated with the asset versus the benefit of the value that you capture at COD is meaningful and very accretive and something we will continue to do. Operator : And our next question is from Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Jeff Osborne \u2013 Cowen and Company : Off to that and I had a question on tax equity as well, is there a way to quantify the price per watt premium that you would get by holding the project and then I just had a question on tax equity in terms of if the search happens that you\u2019re preparing for with your capacity, do you think there is enough tax equity appetite for a big uptick in solar demand in '15 and '16 if you do get a super cycle? Jim Hughes : On the price per watt it varies because the price per watt to install you know a project across the U.S. varies and so there is all of that \u2013 your impact is going to vary. So I would point you back to basically about 50 basis points of return and you can do the math around that and that will sort of comes back to be pretty meaningful. As it relates to tax equity, yes I think as you get into '15 and into '16, I think there could be some constraints, but that\u2019s also why it's important to find relationships like whether it's with Southern or others that we have dealt with that we can structure transactions with them that effectively allows them to play the role of tax equity and do it in a much more efficient manner than trying to be engaging with the current tax equity players that are in the market that are generally constrained and in terms of the availability and their return expectations are much higher than what we think they should be. And so we have tried to look at other alternatives to leverage and optimize that tax attributes in a most efficient manner and have that flexibility as we move into 2015 and 2016 where tax capacity could become more constrained and as a result of that more expensive . Operator : And our next question is from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok \u2013 Needham & Company: So first question when I look at your booking, actually when I look at like the marginal shipment in terms of revenue and megawatt that you\u2019ve laid out on your presentation, does that include project that you guys plan to eventually hold a balance sheet for a period of time and therefore not materialize into revenue? And then kind of a follow-up question on mid-to-late stage opportunity, that number has come down. Is that a function of the full four-day you guys talk about for 2016 and therefore as a result that number has come down? Jim Hughes : As it relates to the first one, that\u2019s just the opportunity of the set that we\u2019re evaluating and as it relates to whether again we decide to sell the asset, hold the asset, sell a portion of the asset, those decisions are all made after we have been able to capture the opportunity and then we evaluate the opportunity of making decision, what's the best way to capture the highest return on invested capital, all right. So don't think about that as being discrete to one potential direction or what our intention is around ultimately how to monetize that asset because it will be aggregated up and we will make a decision at the right time again to figure out how do we get the best return on invested capital. I don't think you should think about the \u2013 the phases of the early to mid or late stage, I mean there are going to move around. Has there been activity that is being pulled forward especially in the U.S.? That\u2019s true but we\u2019re seeing more robust activity happening outside of that U.S., that\u2019s filling in some of those latter buckets as Jim indicated. We clearly see the opportunity that buffer maybe potentially slower demand in '17 with our international platform and success from that regard. Operator : And our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital. Unidentified Analyst : This is (indiscernible) for Mahesh. Just a quick one, it seems you\u2019re not pursing a YieldCo for those self-developed assets you mentioned that you could sell a portion or all of them or just hold them on balance sheet. I'm just wondering metrics or economics you will look at to make those decisions whether the project to hold or sell? Jim Hughes : As I indicated again we will look at many different metrics and return on invested capital and our equity and internal rate of return, the MPV, I mean we\u2019re going to look at it from a lot of different ways and evaluate the optionality that we\u2019ve and make a decision which we think is the right decision to make and again there may be some decisions that we will also look at well given the potential liquidity that can be generated from a particular transaction. We may say we want to sell more of it because we want to benefit ourselves from the liquidity because we have alternative uses of that cash at that point in time that we want to deploy. So it will be a holistic comprehensive analysis and one that\u2019s well informed and insightful again and ultimately to create the best value for our shareholders and optionality for First Solar. Operator : And our last question comes from Colin Rusch with Northland Capital Markets. Colin Rusch \u2013 Northland Capital Markets : Can you talk a little bit about the logic behind ramping capacity given that you're still at 77% capacity and then also just talk about the bookings how that breaks down between projects and modules? Jim Hughes : So in the ramping capacity, you have to remember that we are in the midst of implementing the technology road map and there is impact upon our capacity utilization as we roll that technology across the fleet. So that utilization is not necessarily reflective of solely demand. It's also reflective of the changes that are being made to the production facilities to implement the technology road map. Mark, do you have any other comment? Mark Widmar : Yes and I think what I was trying to say before is that, again the reason for the ramp is the technology and the offering has become more and more competitive. And it's really indicative of the demand profile that we currently see in front of us for 2015. Now we did run at less than full utilization and we've been doing that now for the last couple of years. Again that\u2019s when our technology was disadvantaged and unable to potentially compete at the same level that we wanted it to. As we made the enhancements to the technology and been able to make it more competitive, we have been able to increase our win rate in the market. It's also reflective of our international expansion and successes that we made in those jurisdictions. As we invested across many markets, we\u2019re seeing the paybacks now start to be realized and as we indicated over 40% of our bookings this quarter for example, we\u2019re out of international markets. I remember not too many quarters back people were always asking us when are we going to start to see bookings come from the international markets? Well this quarter we started to see it and we continue to see that in front of us, so it's a combination of the technology overall being more competitive. The successes that we are now starting to see in the international market as we made investments in them over the last few quarters is really what's paying off from that perspective. I think the other one that you said was around bookings between systems and modules, we don't provide that level of detail. Operator : And at this time this does conclude our question and answer session. And also concludes our call we appreciate everyone's participation. Jim Hughes : All right. Thanks everybody. Mark Widmar : Thank you.",

Andrew Hughes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management) Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to David Brady, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations for First Solar, Inc. Mr. Brady, you may begin. David Brady - Vice President-Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update, then Mark will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in detail and provide guidance for the first quarter of 2015. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, David. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Let me begin by addressing the announcement made yesterday that we are in advanced negotiations with SunPower to form a joint YieldCo vehicle to which we expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets. Upon the execution of a master formation agreement, the parties intend to file a registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering of the YieldCo. Completion of the joint venture and IPO is subject to the execution of definitive documentation and board and regulatory approval. We cannot say any more about the transaction at this time, and we will not be taking any questions on the subject in our Q&A session today. We expect to file a public S-1 this quarter, which will provide additional details on this proposed transaction. However, I do want to emphasize the strategic value of this decision to First Solar shareholders. We have undertaken a careful study of the strategic options available and have determined that this is the best course of action to maximize project and shareholder returns in the long-term. This combination brings together the two leading and most bankable companies in the solar industry with a combined installed base of 16 gigawatts, the strongest balance sheets in the sector and combined strength in utility scale and distributed generation as well as a broad geographical base. Lastly, as a result of this announcement, the 2015 target we provided at our prior Analyst Day is no longer applicable. Until we have clarity on the creation of a joint YieldCo with SunPower, we do not believe it is meaningful to provide full year 2015 guidance. Moreover, as a result of this potential transaction, we have decided to delay an Analyst Day at this time. We will continue to evaluate holding an Analyst Day later this year. Now, for an update on our technology. First, as we announced earlier this month, we have set yet another new world record for CadTel cell efficiency of 21.5%. This latest milestone certified at the Newport Lab and documented in NREL Best Research Cell Efficiencies exceeds our previous records of 21%. We have now increased our record cell efficiency by over 400 basis points since mid-2011. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the potential of our CadTel technology and is another tremendous accomplishment by our R&D team. In conjunction with our record cell efficiency, we also announced that our production PV modules have reached a quality and reliability milestone by achieving Atlas 25+ certification following a rigorous series of long-term combined-stress environmental exposure tests. This certification represents some of the most stringent standards available, and demonstrates that the progress in our module technology is not only in efficiency improvements, but also in quality and reliability. We continue to see the advancements in our technology manifest in our production module efficiency. Our full fleet average conversion efficiency for the fourth quarter was 14.4%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year. We now have several lines of production running our latest technology and we are encouraged by the results. So far this month, four of these lines have averaged an impressive 15.8% efficiency. This technology will be rolled out across the fleet over the course of 2015. Switching briefly to our TetraSun product, we have recently begun production of our TetraSun modules at our manufacturing facility in Malaysia. We are encouraged by the performance of the technology, which is being produced with initial cell efficiencies of 20.5%. Our expected capacity for 2015 is approximately 50 megawatts and we will ramp future production levels based on market demand. Let me now turn to slides 5 and 6, which highlight the tremendous progress we made in new bookings in 2014 and during the first two months of 2015. As in the past, this data represents our total business and includes systems, Module Plus and module-only sales. Total bookings for 2014 were 2.5 gigawatts DC, which equates to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7. This far exceeds the 2 gigawatt DC target we communicated at Analyst Day last year and highlights the momentum in our bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have booked over 1 gigawatt with 726 megawatts recorded prior to the end of 2014 and the remaining 311 megawatts occurring during the first two months of 2015. As a result, our ending outstanding bookings are now at 4 gigawatts DC, an increase of 1.3 gigawatts from where we began 2014. The strength of these bookings and the accelerating demand we have seen in recent months is a testament to the increasing competitiveness of our module technology. The single largest booking in the quarter was the 130 megawatts AC California Flats project. As previously announced, the PPA for this project was signed with Apple and is the largest agreement in the industry to provide solar power to the commercial end user. This 25-year PPA will provide power to Apple's new headquarters, data centers and retail operations in California. This deal signals the growing importance of affordable clean energy to commercial customers. Combined with the previously announced 150 megawatt AC PPA signed with PG&E, the total project stands at 280 megawatts AC. The combined size of the California Flats project represents one of the largest self-developed projects announced in the last several years, highlighting our tremendous strength in utility-scale solar. This past quarter, we continued to demonstrate significant progress in the southeastern United States. We signed agreements with Southern Power to provide EPC services to two projects in Georgia totaling over 210 megawatts AC. The larger of the two, the 130 megawatt AC Taylor project is expected to begin construction in September of this year and achieve COD in late 2016. Additionally, we recently signed a 188 megawatt DC Module Plus deal with Strata Solar to supply projects in North Carolina. All together, our bookings in the southeastern U.S. since mid-2014 now total almost 700 megawatts DC. We also saw strength in our international bookings. In India, we contracted 265 megawatts DC of volume since our last call. As disclosed previously, we were awarded 80 megawatts AC of projects in Andhra Pradesh, India. We have now signed the PPA on these projects and included them in our booking total. The remaining volume booked in the quarter was module-only sales. Underscoring our commitment to the growing solar market in India, we announced last week at RE-Invest a commitment to develop 5 gigawatts of solar projects by 2019. We are excited by the Indian government's vision for solar energy and look forward to helping them achieve these goals. Also, in Turkey, we were encouraged by the results of the recent solar power tender where we secured 19 megawatts AC of connection capacity. Other partners competing with First Solar technology were also successful. While small on relative terms to our overall bookings for the quarter, it is a significant first step in a market with tremendous potential for solar. Turning to outstanding bookings and revenue terms, our expected revenue stands at $7.5 billion, approximately flat compared to the beginning of the year. The increase in megawatts booked was offset by a higher mix of module-only and Module Plus volume, which resulted in the flat revenue bookings, but also is indicative of our efficiency improvements on the competitiveness of our module in the global marketplace. Turning to slide 7, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which now stand at 13.5 gigawatt DC, a slight decrease from 13.7 gigawatts in the prior quarter, primarily due to the conversion of several opportunities to bookings. As a reminder, this represents all potential bookings whether they are self-developed projects, EPC contracts, Module Plus or module-only. Contracted projects are not included in this total. While our total opportunities decreased slightly, we are encouraged by the increase in the size of our mid to late-stage deals, which increased by over 500 megawatts from the prior period. Slide 8 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America stands at 7.5 gigawatts or 56% of the total. One indication of the continued progress we are making in developing international markets is that the vast majority of our roughly 1.5 gigawatts of mid to late-stage deals are outside of North America. And finally, in December, we announced our entry into the residential solar market with a strategic investment in Clean Energy Collective. CEC is the nation's leading developer of community solar and this strategic partnership allows us to develop end-market community solar offerings to residential customers and businesses directly on behalf of client utilities. Community solar is not only a more cost effective solution for customers, but it also significantly expands consumers' access to solar electricity. This allows any power consumer to go solar including those who live in multi-tenant buildings, rent or whose rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels. In contrast to typical residential rooftop installations, which are limited to a fraction of the population due to factors such as income, local radiance and homeownership, virtually anyone can benefit from community solar. Community solar allows an individual to benefit directly from owning part of a solar asset without concern such as an increase in their homeowners insurance problems that arise when their rooftop requires repair or replacement or transferability of residential rooftop leases when they sell their home. For example, a student renting a condo could own panels through a community solar program and take along credit for that solar power even when he moves or just transfer or sell his ownership to a third-party without the need for credit scores. This strategic partnership with CEC allows First Solar to play to the strength of our proven utility scale capabilities, while leveraging the expertise of a leading community solar program operator. As an integral part of our distributed generation strategy, we will provide periodic updates on the progress of this partnership. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our Q4 financial results and discuss guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Turning to slide 11, I'll begin by discussing fourth quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 509 megawatts DC, an increase of 13% from the prior quarter and 15% higher year-over-year due to the restart of our four manufacturing lines in Malaysia as well as higher module efficiency. Our factory capacity utilization was 84%, up 7 percentage points from the third quarter. Higher factory utilization was also due to the restart of the idle capacity. In the fourth quarter, the average conversion efficiency of our modules was 14.4%, which is up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 100 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 14.8% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of approximately 50 basis points from the prior quarter. As Jim mentioned, our best lines are averaging 15.8% for the month of February. The substantial increase in our lead line efficiency continues to highlight the great progress our team is making to deliver our module efficiency roadmap, which effectively is converting our record cell and module accomplishment into reality. We are encouraged by our CadTel entitlement and the relative competitive energy density it can achieve. Moving on to slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the fourth quarter were just over $1 billion compared to sales of $889 million last quarter. The increase is due to the sale of the Solar Gen project to Southern, initial revenue recognition on Silver State South, higher third-party module sales and various other system projects under construction. This was partially offset by lower revenue from our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects which both achieved substantial completion in the quarter. As a percentage of total net sales, our system revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in the system projects, was 92%, a decrease of three percentage points from the prior quarter. The higher mix of third-party module sales was primarily due to recognizing revenue on BELECTRIC's landing project, which at 46 megawatts DC is the largest operating solar farm in the U.K. For 2014, net sales increased to $3.4 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2013. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, sales were lower due to a partial sale of the Solar Gen project, the timing of some module sales pushed into early 2015, and lower system revenue from weather-related delays. As highlighted in our last earnings call, our guidance assumed we sold 100% of Solar Gen to Southern; however, we noted subject to certain terms and conditions, we had the right to retain a minority interest in the project. In the fourth quarter, we elected to retain a 49% interest in Solar Gen. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 30.6% compared to 21.3% in the third quarter. The increase was due to a higher profit associated with partial sale of Solar Gen and cost reductions on the Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. On a full year basis, gross margins decreased 170 basis points to 24.4% from 26.1% in 2013. The lower gross margin was the result of the mix of system projects under construction between the periods. Fourth quarter operating expenses increased to $109 million, primarily due to the higher startup expenses associated with restarting capacity. For the full year 2014, operating expenses were $403 million compared to 2013 operating expenses of $407 million, which excludes $87 million of restructuring and asset impairments. The decrease in operating expenses from 2013 was primarily due to lower depreciation and compensation expenses, partially offset by higher investment in research and development of our CadTel technology. Operating income for the quarter was $199 million compared to $84 million in Q3. The increase was due to higher sequential sales and the increase in gross margins discussed earlier. For the year, operating income was $424 million compared to 2013 operating income of $455 million, which also excludes the $89 million of restructuring and asset impairments. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $192 million or $1.89 per fully diluted share compared to $0.87 per fully diluted share in the third quarter. Full year earnings per fully diluted share was $3.91 including a $0.26 benefit of a one-time tax item noted in Q3. Excluding this item, full year earnings per share were $3.66. Note that relative to our guidance for the quarter and full year, there were several factors that led to the difference between our actual result and expectations. First, as indicated, we have elected to retain a minority interest in Solar Gen. As a result, a portion of the revenue associated with this project was not recognized in the quarter and contributed to the lower-than-forecasted revenue. Gross margin and operating income exceeded the guidance for the quarter due to the higher-than-expected profits associated with Solar Gen and significant project cost savings on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. The resulting earnings were significantly higher than the $2.80 per share which was the upper end of our full year guidance due to the aforementioned factors and a lower-than-expected tax rate, which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Putting the results into context for the year, excluding the $0.26 per share one-time tax item we highlighted in Q3, our full year earnings would have been $3.66. The difference between the $3.66 and the $2.80 guidance is attributed to an additional $0.26 from the lower-than-expected tax rate in Q4, with the remaining difference approximately $0.60 due to our better-than-expected gross margin. This highlights the strength of our execution from our core business and the project cost savings achieved. Turning to slide 13, I will review the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $876 million to $2 billion. Our net cash position nearly doubled to just under $1.8 billion. The increase in cash resulted primarily from the sale of Solar Gen as well as the collection of retention payments on our Desert Sunlight and Topaz projects. We anticipate that our cash position will continue to have large fluctuations quarter-to-quarter as we continue to construct some projects on balance sheet. Our net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by approximately $845 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to the reduction in unbilled accounts receivables from the collection of cash retention on Topaz and Desert Sunlight, a decrease in deferred project cost from the sale of Solar Gen and a reduction in trade AR. These items were partially offset by an increase in inventories. Total debt during the quarter decreased slightly to $217 million. Of this total, $75 million is project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile. Cash flow from operations was $928 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $47 million in Q3. Free cash flow was $858 million compared to negative free cash flow of $107 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $73 million, a slight increase from $71 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $62 million compared to $60 million in the prior quarter. Turning to slide 14, I will now discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2015. Note that given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo formation, we are holding off on providing full year guidance at this time. Specific to the quarter, our anticipated financial results is being impacted as we hold projects, build them on balance sheet for the potential YieldCo creation previously mentioned. While we believe this path will create long-term project and shareholder value, in the near-term, it will result in lower financial results than if we had sold these projects to a third-party. Our abbreviated financial guidance for the first quarter is as follows : net sales in the range of $550 million to $650 million, a loss of $0.25 to $0.35 per fully diluted share, cash used in operations expected to be between $400 million and $500 million. The sequentially lower revenue earnings and operating cash flow is due to two main factors. First, in the fourth quarter, we sold a partial interest in Solar Gen and achieved substantial completion on our Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects. In addition, we are constructing several projects on balance sheet in Q1. We expect to complete nearly 200 megawatts in the quarter where we will not recognize any revenue. Now, moving on to slide 15, I'd like to summarize our progress during the past quarter and past year. First, we continue to demonstrate the enormous potential of our CadTel technology. We set another new cell record efficiency of 21.5%, positioning us firmly on track to meet the 22% target we set last year. In addition, our efficiency continues to improve rapidly. Our lead line efficiency improved to 14.8% in Q4, which is 90 basis points improvement from the prior year. We've had tremendous progress in our new bookings with 2.5 gigawatts contracted during the year. We set a target of 2 gigawatts to book for the year and we have exceeded that goal. Our book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.7, allowing us to replenish our pipeline. From a financial standpoint, we exceeded both our earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance. Finally, we believe the announced joint YieldCo with SunPower is the best avenue to achieve to help provide access to sustainable, competitive cost of capital, which should ultimately provide enhanced value to the First Solar shareholders. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter and the partnership. First on the bookings, could you just talk about what caused the strength in bookings? And maybe if you could give us some color on what your targets are. You had a 2-gigawatt in 2014 and how we should think about that heading into 2015? And then putting that together with efficiency and what that is helping you guys with and if it's helping you guys get back on rooftop or how should we think about that? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Ben. First, I don't think we're in a position to be able to provide you any guidance on the bookings outlook for 2015 at this time. But generally, the strength in 2014 was relatively broad-based and it's a consistent pattern that we're seeing across broad swaths of our business where as costs continue to come down, we're seeing greater and greater adoption rates and what's particularly encouraging is a lot of this adoption is driven not by any policy impetus, but more by a recognition that utility-scale solar represents a compelling value opportunity. So we've seen the growth in the market outside of California in the United States particularly the southeast United States continue to see strong activity in that region in Texas, in the western United States, in North America. As identified, we continue to see a lot of strong activity in India. We've had our initial success in Turkey and expect to see momentum there. We've had continued drum beat of activity in Europe. It's not gigantic but it continues to roll along. And so we've just seen sort of a broad-based, a lot of the seeds that we planted over the last two and a half years starting to take root and generate opportunities for us. So it's really been broad-based. Obviously, as the efficiency continues to improve, particularly the most recent efficiency improvements and bear in mind that we've been competing in the market with the knowledge of where our efficiency was going to get to. So what we're seeing come off the production line now is what we've been competing with for the last 12 months. And obviously, as we are now roughly at parity from a temperature adjusted energy density standpoint, it just dramatically increases our ability to compete and dramatically increases the entitlement we have to compete and to margin at the end of the day. So the two go \u2013 we believe the two go hand-in-hand. There's broad overall pretty good health across the solar sector. And then we, as an individual company, are doing well because we continue to have such success in advancing our technology. Operator : We'll go next to Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, two questions. One for Jim, one for Mark. Jim, one of your competitors today talked about how selling projects would become the exception, not the rule. Now that you're moving in the direction of a YieldCo, can you talk about the relative priority of selling versus EPC versus module business versus, of course, holding for your own benefit? And then the second question really for Mark is, are you in a position to share with us what the current megawatts on the balance sheet is and the approximate cash deal (27:30) on an annualized basis that falls out of those megawatts? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right. So first, with respect to anything associated with YieldCo, SEC rules don't allow us to really make any comment. In terms of the various product lines, module, Module Plus, EPC and system, we don't have a preference as much as we look for what is our most potent weapon in each marketplace in which we operate. What is it that the customer wants in each marketplace? We have different customers with different needs. Some customers have self-execution capability and they want to buy a module and we're happy to supply them. Other customers want to own the facility but they really want someone to handle the full turnkey EPC execution. And then there's a spectrum in between those two that is the Module Plus in AC Power Block offerings where the customer doesn't want to own and they want to be provided with power, obviously, that flows out of our development business. And we will choose to monetize those development assets in the manner that provides the greatest long-term value for our shareholders the same philosophy we've had for the last two and a half years. There's nothing that's going to change with respect to that analysis. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : As Jim indicated, especially, Paul, on the last question around what is the cash flows that falls out of the projects, we can't provide any color around that. But what I can say is that we have a 20-megawatt project on the balance sheet in Maryland that we've actually had on our balance sheet for a while. We just noted that we retained a 49% interest in Solar Gen, and that's 150-megawatt AC project. And we're building a couple hundred megawatts on balance sheet right now. Those are the statements that we've made. So that's the level of detail that I can provide at this point in time. As it relates to any information relative to the cash flow associated with those projects, we can't provide that at this time. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. I'll hop back on in line. Operator : We'll go next to Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the partnership. The first question, just thinking about the wholesale commercial PPA you announced recently, can you maybe talk to us about that segment in particular if it offers any different competitive environment versus traditional utility-based PPA? And then my second question for Mark, just thinking about what the gross margin or revenue impact was in the quarter for selling Solar Gen 2, just so we can understand that impact. Thanks, guys. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. With respect to the Apple PPA on California Flats, there's a great deal of similarities with these large commercial transactions as compared to a traditional utility transaction. And there are some significant differences. So companies like this are very savvy and sophisticated procurers of their energy. They are as in-depth and as thorough as any utility would be. I will say that perhaps the largest difference is that they are satisfying whatever they have determined their priorities and needs to be as a company, whereas a utility is working to a regulatory standard or a prudent utility standard. There can be some nuanced differences between the two approaches as a result of that. But by and large, it's the same teams executing the two segments. It's the same product. It's just the commercial relationship and the priorities that the customers may have a bit of a nuisance to it. But we think you'll see more of it as we move forward in time. We think you'll see it expands to other geographies and obviously we're very excited about the deal. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Relative to Solar Gen, we won't provide the specific as it relates to the revenue and the gross margin. What I can say is that relative to the guidance, the fact that as we indicated, we actually retained 49% of the interest in Solar Gen, I think you could infer that the revenue miss relative to the guidance largely was attributed to that. Relative to gross margin and as we indicated, operationally we were about $0.60 better than what we had initially guided towards. The best way I would paint that is think of it about half of it was better margin realization on Solar Gen, which is a combination of better value. Again, indicative of cost capitals in the market as well as more \u2013 lower cost to construct. So there's cost savings. And then the other half of that $0.60 was largely associated with cost savings that we realized on Desert Sunlight and Topaz. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Mark, you can talk a little about your expectations of project completion for the rest of the year? How we should be thinking about the pipeline of projects and the bookings that you have and the (32:53) looking at right now given your cost, input cost structure and maybe you're looking \u2013 are you passing on some of the cost savings to your customers? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Vishal, I'm not sure I understood the first. The first one's trying to understand kind of the earnings impact of the timing of the sale of our projects? Just trying to make sure, can you repeat it, please? Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: No, I'm just trying to understand how many \u2013 how should we think about the linearity of project completions for the rest of the year? I know you said 200 megawatts will be completed in Q1. How we should be thinking about the rest of the year, given your backlog and the bookings ramp that you've seen in the fourth quarter? And then where do you think the PPA environment is right now with the improved cost structure? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : So I guess the best way to point you to and obviously we disclosed this in our K as well, so that you can look at the projects that have PPA dates or \u2013 excuse me, COD dates with 2015. And those would include Lost Hills and North Star and Kingbird as an example, right? So those are going to be the projects, which will be achieving COD this year and will ultimately recognize revenue on. It will be lumpy the same way that \u2013 I can't give you a profile of how that flows through the year. The construction of the activity will be relatively linear not only for those projects but for the projects that we are constructing with CODs in 2016. However, the revenue associated with that and the cash flows associated will be relatively lumpy based on the CODs that are achieved. So I think the best way to think about it we're constructing a couple hundred megawatts on balance sheet. If you look at our aggregate pipeline of north of a gigawatt that will be achieved COD between now and the end of 2016, that's the kind of cadence and kind of rhythm that we're on right now in terms of the monthly profile of 100 megawatts or so of construction of self-developed assets. Around the PPA environment, we're not going to provide any color on that at this point in time. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. First off, could you provide some color on how you're thinking about the impact to cash flow economics at a high level on projects post-ITC starting in 2017 versus the levels that you're generating at now? I guess one of your peers suggested recently that it would be 20% to 30% lower, but would be curious to hear your take. And then secondly, if I look at the implied bookings, ASP this quarter or quarter-to-date, it suggests about $1 a watt which is \u2013 it's lower than what you've been at for the past several quarters here. So wondering how much of that is being driven by mix here in the near-term versus just cost deflation on a like-for-like project basis. And also if there's any international embedded in that mix that's having an impact? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : So on the cash flow and the economics post the ITC, I mean the simple math says the ITC if it steps down from 30% to 10%, I mean obviously that's going to drive down the overall economics of the project now. Now, you get a partial offset of that because you can recover a little bit more makers back, because the makers is \u2013 you take half of the ITC delta and you reduce your maker's basis by that. So instead of taking a 15% delta, now you've taken a 5% delta. So you get a little bit more makers back, but again, that's spread out over five years. But what we would say is that, obviously, it's going to make the economics more challenging, however, when you look at our roadmap and the entitlement of where our installed cost is going, driven by the improvement of our module efficiency, higher energy density, and overall reductions that we're driving across our balance of systems, we'll be better positioned than most to compete in that type of environment. So, yes, economics will become a little bit more challenging, but when you couple that with an aggressive cost reduction roadmap that we're on the journey of delivering again, we feel that we will be able to realize comparable economics post the ITC as we are pre-ITC especially if we get into the 2018 and 2019 timeline. So we think we are pretty well-positioned from that. As it relates to the bookings ASP, you've got to remember one of the things that Jim indicated in the first quarter. I think we booked a little less than 200 megawatts with Strata, which was included in that number. That's mainly module-only, right? So when you do the math, you got to remember that that mix of what came through in that 300 megawatts or so and the year-to-date bookings number was highly impacted as a result of that. Now, the other thing I would say about Strata, I think it's important it relates back to the comment that Jim answered or the question that Jim answered at the very front was around the relative competitiveness of our technology. That's a new customer for us. Now, Strata obviously has installed hundreds of megawatts. What we've been able to do is displace other mainly Chinese module suppliers that they have historically relied upon. That we've been able with the overall increased competitiveness in our technology, developing the strong relationship with the customer, and then strength of our balance sheet and overall bankability, we've been able to penetrate an account that we historically have not had a presence in which I think is a great testament to the accomplishment of our BD team as well as our technology. But that's the thing you've got to keep in perspective as it relates to the first quarter. It is somewhat skewed down because of the high mix of module-only sales. Operator : We'll go next to Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask in terms of the full year 2015, what are your expectations on the total systems built? How many megawatts do you guys intend to complete in the year? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : I guess, the best way to say that is you can look at our disclosure tomorrow in the Q. And as I indicated, we've got north of a gigawatt of volume that has to achieve COD by the end of 2016. It largely is going to be relatively linear. I mean we're going to have to construct that in a relatively linear basis in order to deliver against that amount of megawatts between now and 2016. We're not going to provide the specifics as it relates to what happens this year versus what's going to happen next year but given the timeline that we're up against, I think it's pretty prudent to understand that it's going be relatively linear. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then the second question I had is in terms of the first quarter guidance, can you provide any color on the gross margin expectations? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : No. I mean, we didn't provide the specifics around that and we're not going to provide that at this point in time. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Hughes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Hughes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on India, it sounds like the opportunity to date has been a mix of modules and projects. Curious on the 5 gigawatt pipeline there, is that all fully developed projects? Is there EPC or module-only in there? And also to the extent that it is projects, could you give us a sense of sort of what the balance of systems cost is in India? We've heard some indications from others that it's really quite low and just curious what you guys are seeing. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On India, the 5 gigawatt number is a development number, so that's a project number, not Module Plus or EPC. And with respect to balance of system, I won't give you a specific number but that generally to date has been a fixed tilt market. And it has been a market with a localized supply chain. So as you would expect in those circumstances, you do get lower cost balance of systems as a result of those factors. Andrew Hughes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just on the TetraSun update, thanks for that, any thought as to slowing that down? Or is it taking a slow trajectory as you achieves such great cell efficiency on the CadTel side? And how you sort of judge those tradeoffs in improving an incumbent technology versus trying to ramp the newcomer? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we have made a specific commitment to the TetraSun that will take us to 100 megawatts, slightly more than 100 megawatts of levelized production when we get it fully ramped up. I think for the time-being, our focus is on let's turn it into a real product. We've got to get through the normal ramp, we've got to get the modules certified in the marketplace, we've got to get a chance with real customers to see what that product looks like. As I've often said, there are nuances to each of the products in the marketplace in terms of operating conditions that they may perform better in, their specific electrical characteristics, their form factor and size characteristics and we think we've always said that there is a place for the higher efficiency product in the marketplace and in our product mix. What we have said we wouldn't understand until we got further down the road is where does the line \u2013 do we draw the line between the dominance of the CadTel product versus the dominance of a high efficiency low cost TetraSun module? And we will continue to evaluate where that line is as we move forward with both products over time. Obviously, the better we do with CadTel, the more it's going to encroach upon market opportunities that might otherwise be a TetraSun market. But we have high hopes for the TetraSun technology also and we believe that we can drive improvements in that technology over time also. So they both have a place in our staple of technologies. And as we move forward in time, we'll continuously evaluate the results we're getting with each. Operator : We'll go next to Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So beyond Solar Gen 2, do you have any other large contractor project that you might have opportunity to retain partial ownership, much like that? That's my first question. And then, relate to the 15.8% efficiency number that you guys have laid out, how do you guys think about the cost per watt of those modules at that efficiency level versus some of the well-known cost per watt of the crystalline silicon Chinese solar manufacturers? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll take your second question first and then let Mark go back to the first one. On cost per watt, we ceased to provide cost per watt information couple of Analyst Day ago because we basically viewed it as commercially sensitive proprietary information. If you go back to older presentations, you can track the relationship between efficiency and cost per watt that used to be contained in those presentations. Now, we are making progress in areas other than just efficiency, but you can at least get some sort of ballpark of the impact by going back and looking at those old presentations and that's all the guidance I can provide you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : As it relates to large projects and our ability to do something similar as we did with Solar Gen, yeah, we have a number of large projects. I mean one of them is the one Jim referenced is the 280-megawatt combined between Apple and PG&E that we have in California Flats. We also announced a couple quarters ago Tribal Solar (45:00), which is another 300-megawatt project. We have Stateline, which is a 300-megawatt project. So we have just between those three projects close to a gigawatt of large projects. Those will be highly sought after assets and we will look to do and monetize those assets in the most efficient manner as possible and to optimize the value. So you could see us replicate that structure as we did with Solar Gen on other assets in the future. Operator : We'll go next to Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Joe (45:36) in for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my questions. When I look at guidance, if my math is correct, it seems like gross margin is only about 10%, which is much lower. And I understand that there are larger percentage of module sales, as well as the retention of the project. But just can you talk about why it seems margin is much lower? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yes. I'm assuming you're referring to \u2013 you walked into an estimate for the first quarter. We didn't provide guidance for gross margin for the first quarter. So however, just to give you an indication of an expectation is the gross margins should be lower in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. I think that's an accurate way to look at it. And it's largely reflective of \u2013 we \u2013 the margin that we'll realize on module-only and EPC will be lower. And so that'll weigh on the results for the first quarter, because we won't be selling any of our self-developed projects. Again, as we indicated, we'll be constructing them on balance sheet. But just think of it from that perspective and it's more of a timing issue, right? So think of it also as it's going to adversely impact the first quarter. We may have a little bit of an impact on the second quarter. When we get into the second half of the year, and assuming a successful launch of the YieldCo, it becomes less of an issue. So think of this as an impact for the first half of the year that allows us to position a portfolio that we can leverage into a YieldCo platform. And then after that, you'll see kind of the normal business structure and performance that we've had historically. Operator : We'll go next to Tyler Frank with Robert W. Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly on projects such as Solar Gen where you retain a 49% ownership, is there anything in those contracts precluding you from selling that project later, for example, selling that to a YieldCo? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yes. I don't want to get into specifics, but let's just say we structured those contracts in such a way that it allows us optimal flexibility. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Okay, great. And then, we saw the announcement that you committed to constructing roughly 5 gigawatts of projects in India. Can you elaborate on that and just give us a little bit of framework on what you think the timing will be like, and how we should think about those projects over the next few years? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that, the India statement was made in connection with the big government of India program to build 100 gigawatts by 2020. So our commitment would occur over that timeframe. I don't think we are far enough along to provide any kind of visibility as to what the project size or the rate at which that gets done. We're looking at a whole variety of projects in India, some modestly-sized and some much larger. The government is also \u2013 all of the developers came in and have put on the table our commitments to the market. The government has a number of reforms that they need to undertake to facilitate that business. And we'll have greater visibility as the new government begins to put those reforms in place. So it's a rapidly changing, rapidly developing market. We believe that the opportunity is real and significant. But it's way too early to talk about any kind of specifics. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Thank you for attending.",

Baird Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Julien Dumoulin Smith - UBS Krish Shankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus Edwin Mok - Needham Paul Coster - JPMorgan Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital markets Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investor section of First Solar\u2019s Web site at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore, Investor Relations Manager for First Solar, Incorporated. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Steve Haymore : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2015. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar\u2019s Web site at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update, then Mark will discuss our first quarter financial results in detail and provide guidance for the second quarter of 2015. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today\u2019s call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note that this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? Jim Hughes : Thanks Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Let me begin by providing a brief update on our prior announcement regarding our intent to form a joint YieldCo vehicle with SunPower. Since our last earnings call the two parties have filed a public S-1 registration statement with the SEC for the initial public offering of 8point3 Energy Partners. Completion of the IPO is still subject to market factors and regulatory approval but we continue to move forward through the process. Again we cannot say any more about the transaction at this time outside of what is the public S-1 documents. Any questions on the subject in our Q&A session will be directed to the public S-1 filing for answers. Now for an update on technology and manufacturing, our module conversion efficiency continued to improve in the first quarter with our full fleet averaging 14.7% efficiency, an improvement of 30 basis points from Q4. Our lead line efficiency averaged 15.6% for the quarter and 80 basis points improvement quarter-over-quarter and a 140 basis point improvement versus Q1 of \u201814. This improvement is the largest sequential and year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency in the history of the company. Even more impressive is the recent performance of our lead line which has reached a new milestone for module efficiency of 16.3%. This is truly a remarkable achievement which demonstrates the ability of our research and manufacturing organizations to execute to our roadmap. By the late Q3 we will have rolled out these latest improvement programs across the majority of our fleet. Slide 4 provides an update to our energy density road map, which we first showed at our Analyst Day last year and puts into context the advances in our efficiency. As we've discussed in the past conversion efficiency is a narrow measure of overall end modular performance, while energy yield produced is a more comprehensive and superior metric. Energy density which is energy yield per meter square and corporate several other factors beyond efficiency alone. These other factors include temperature, humidity and shade tolerance.  Capital technology has advantages in each of these areas overall multi crystalline competitors. As shown in the metrics our Q1 end of quarter lead line efficiency achieved clarity with multi crystalline silicon on an energy density basis. In the space of only a month our lead line has now achieved an energy density advantage to multi crystalline silicon. To put these achievement in perspective when we first introduced this metric a year ago at our Analyst Day we had a significant disadvantage but in the space of a little over a year we have now erased that deficit. During the remainder of 2015 while our lead line will improve only modestly our overall fleet average efficiency will increase significantly as the improvements are rolled out across the fleet.  In coming years we expect to further increase our relative advantage based on the strength of our technology road map compared to our prior energy density road map our expectations of relative advantage in future years has been updated. The updates to the road map are primarily due to revised timing of our new technology implementations which has been adjusted to minimize downtime from technology upgrades in order to maximize output particularly in 2016. Most importantly the metric highlights the favorable competitive position we anticipate as we execute on our technology road map. Given that all of new modular efficiency announcements are not created equal, let me make a few points related to our 16.3% product lead lines efficiency as it relates to recent crystalline silicon record modules. First crystalline silicon competitors typically calculate record efficiencies using the aperture area of the module. We calculate efficiency on a full area basis. Our 16.3% efficiency announced today would equate to a 16.9% aperture area efficiency, likewise our 17% record module which we announced last year would be 17.5% on a similar aperture area basis. It's also important to understand that our 16.9% aperture efficiency is in high volume commercial production and not in a laboratory. This new record also reflects materials and processes that are cost competitive and allow us to continue to lower our cost per watt. It is important to keep these facts in mind and based on our technology achievements we feel that we are well positioned to compete with any commercial crystalline silicon technology available. Turning to Slide 5, let me discuss our capacity and demand outlook for 2015. This slide besides illustrating our production capacity for 2015 more importantly highlights the profound impact efficiency improvements have on output. Since 2013 the year our production levels where at a low point, efficiency and throughput improvement have contributed to over 450 megawatts of capacity or the equivalent of five new lines. This is a key point to understand that our investment in efficiency improvements not only improves our competitiveness but also results in significant incremental capacity without building new factories. As a result of the improving competitiveness of our module and a continues demand we see ahead of the potential ITC step down after 2016, we are ramping our factories to full utilization. Also as we indicated previously we are adding two additional lines at out Ohio location. We are virtually sold out for 2015 and were increasing our contracted volumes for next year. We expect to shift between 2.6 to 2.8 giga watts for the year including shipments to self-developed projects in the first quarter we have ship 690 megawatts, a new record for a single quarter. We are encouraged by the continuing bookings momentum as highlighted on Slide 6. Total bookings for the first quarter of 2015 were 422 megawatts DC against shipments of 690 megawatts DC. In the month of April we have booked an additional 483 megawatts, as a result our [in need] outstanding bookings are now at 3.9 giga watt DC and increase of 200 megawatts from where we ended 2014. Achieving a book to bill ratio of at least 1 :1 remains our objective for the year, but it will be more challenging in 2015 as some inventory was carried over from the prior year due to minor delays and shipments to projects. This single largest bookings since are last earnings call was a modular plus agreement that we signed with Strata Solar for 300 megawatts DC of deliveries in 2016. Through this deal we've continued to strengthen our relationship with Strata is well as extend our leadership in the southeast in United States. Also in the south we signed an EPC agreement to construct the 100 megawatts IFC solar project and in a separate transaction signed a module plus agreement with Silicon Ranch to supply a 17 megawatts DC onsite commercial and industrial solar power installation. This later project highlights the value that's First Solar technology provides to the growing number of commercial and industrial customers seeking clean and affordable power. Internationally, we continue to make strides in India where we booked another 75 megawatt AC of self-developed projects. This brings our capital project total in total in India to 200 megawatts AC and demonstrates the progress we are making in this rapidly growing market. Finally, our utility scale solar development activities in Japan continue to progress as demonstrated by our first booking to this month. We expect commence construction on our first round of projects under the mega solar program in Q3 this year. While the cumulative volume of these initial projects is relatively small. It represents an important evolution from supplying modules to third parties in Japan to now successfully developing and realizing our own pipeline. It also demonstrates that our [indiscernible] technology has achieved adoption and acceptance in this important market. Turning to Slide 7, our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at 7.6 billion, an increase of approximately 300 million compared to the beginning of the year. The balance increases primarily due to lower revenue recognized in the first quarter resulting from constructing more projects on balance sheet. We don\u2019t provide details related to the gross margin on our bookings we are seeing improving trends as we continue to lower our cost and see some stability in pricing. Turning to Slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to 14 giga watts DC, an increase of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter. Note also that the total potential booking increased despite the strong year-to-date bookings. We are also pleased that the size of our mid to late stage opportunities has nearly doubled from the prior period to 3 giga watts. This increases our confidence in our ability to hit our 1 :1 book-to-bill ratio for the year.  Slide 9 shows the breakdown of demand by geography. Our opportunity set outside the North America stands at 8.3 giga watts or 59% of the total. Our transition to sustainable markets outside the U.S. is gaining traction as we are increasingly seeing the results of our investments and developing regions. More than half of our mid and late stage opportunities are now in international markets. Finally, as announced earlier today we have entered into a strategic alliance with Caterpillar to provide integrated turnkey photovoltaic solutions for distributed generation in microgrids applications. As part of this announcement First Solar will provide a pre-engineered solutions package including our advance module technology which will be sold under the Cat brand and through Cat\u2019s dealer network.  First Solar technology which will be combined with Caterpillar\u2019s generator sets and energy storage offerings will initially be marketed in the Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America regions beginning in the second half of 2015. Microgrids provide value to prime power diesel and gas customers by integrating renewable energy, such as solar power, with generator sets. The targeted opportunity includes Microgrids in the 1 to 2 megawatt range in locations such as mines in remote towns and villages. This alliance further highlights the ongoing global energy transition where Solar\u2019s cost competitiveness allows it to compliment conventional generation and is an existing opportunity to continue First Solar\u2019s growth outside of our core utility scale business. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss guidance for the second quarter. Mark Widmar : Thanks Jim and good afternoon. Turning to Slide 12, I\u2019ll begin by discussing the first quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 540 megawatt DC, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and improved factory utilization. Production was 22% higher year-over-year due to the upper mentioned factors and the restart of four manufacturing lines in Malaysia. Our package fast utilization was 87%, up 3 percentage points from the fourth quarter. Higher factory utilization Q1 was primarily due to less down time related to upgrades. In the first quarter the average conversion efficiency of our models was 14.7% which is up 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 120 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 15.6% efficiency during the quarter an impressive increase of 80 basis points from the prior quarter and a 140 basis points year-over-year. Also as Jim indicated our lead line continues to make remarkable progress as we are now running at 16.3% efficiency. To put this in perspective, a module produce that are on the facility had 16.3% efficiency has a cost-per-watt a low $0.40 excluding sales related cost.  Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019ll discuss the P&L. Net sales for the first quarter were 469 million compared to sales of 1 billion last quarter. The lower net sale is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet following our decision to pursue a YieldCo. In addition, the sale of SolarGen in the prior quarter, a higher mix of module only sales in Q1 and delays on several projects in the current quarter resulted in the sequential revenue decline. Relative to our expectations for the quarter net sales were lower due to several factors. First the sale of partial interest in our [indiscernible] project did not close in the first quarter as anticipated due to delays in coordinating with utilities to complete the required commissioning test. The sale will close in early April and will be reflected in our Q2 results. In addition, revenue on several system projects was impacted by a combination of permitting delays in the West Coast port strike. It's important to note that while these try to get you resulted in a delivery of revenue recognition in Q1 we anticipate recovering the revenue and earnings in the balance of the year. As we've communicated previously our systems business can be lumpy from one quarter to the next. Therefore it's important to look at the business through a lens that spans multiple quarters. As a percentage of total net sales our systems revenue which includes both our EPS revenue and solar modules used in the systems projects was 78%, a decrease of 14 percentage points from the prior quarter. The higher mix of third party module sales was primarily related to shipments to India and the upper mention project delays. Gross margin in the first quarter was 8.3% compared to 30.6% in the fourth quarter. The loan gross margin is due to constructing more projects on balance sheet in the preparation for YieldCo, unfavorable absorption of fixed cost against the lower sales volume, higher mix of module only sales and higher mix of lower margin systems project. In addition, the sales of SolarGen in the prior quarter contributed to the sequential decline. First quarter operating expenses were approximately flat at a 190 million, SG&A expenses were lower but are offset by an increase in startup expense associated with the restarting capacity. Also note Q1 operating expenses includes approximately 4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3 Energy Partners. The first quarter operating loss of 70 million compared to an operating income of 199 million in Q4, the decrease was due to sequentially lower sales and gross margin. The net loss in the first quarter was $62 million or $0.62 per fully diluted share compared to net income of $1.89 per fully diluted share in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 14, I will now discuss the balance sheet impact and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities [decreased] by $506 million to $1.5 billion. Our net cash position now outstands at 1.2 billion a decrease from 1.8 billion in the prior quarter. As indicated on last year\u2019s quarter earnings call decrease in cash was expected as we are constructing several large projects on balance sheet and in conjunction with our YieldCo strategy. Increasing structural activities and holding interest and assets on balance sheet ahead of our plan YieldCo IPO will continue to through the second quarter of the year and place additional requirements on liquidity. Our net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased by 516 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in project assets and related activities and an increase in account receivable. [Long-term] debt increased from the prior quarter by 26 million to 243 million the increase is related to additional draw downs on the project level debt associated with Luz del Norte in Chile, partially offset by schedule payments on our Malaysian modules. Cash flow used in operations was 418 million compared to cash flows from operations of 920 million in Q4 free cash flow was a negative 466 million compared to positive free cash flow of 858 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled 55 million a decrease of 18 million from the prior quarter, depreciation in the quarter was 62 million, was unchanged from the prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 15, I'll now discuss our guidance for the second quarter of 2015. As indicated on last quarter's earning call given the announcement regarding the proposed YieldCo formation we are holding off of providing full year guidance until after 8point3 Energy Partner\u2019s IPO. Similar to the first quarter our expected financial results for Q2 will be influenced by constructing projects of balance sheet, a mix of lower margin if you see projects and third party modular sales. In the near term this will continue to contribute to lower earnings that's can be seen in our future guidance, in the second half of the year we anticipate a stronger financial results than the first half as we return to a more normal course of business. Our BBA to financial guidance for the second quarter is as follows, net sales in the range of 750 million to 850 million, earnings of $0.45 to $0.55 per fully diluted share. Cashed used in operations is expected to be between 250 million to 350 million. Note that our earnings per share estimate include a non-recurring tax benefit of approximately $0.40. This week we received a favorable ruling to Malaysian Cash Tax authorities which resulted in discreet [QT] tax benefit. Finally, one last point related to guidance, the Q2 earnings guidance does not reflect any potential impact to our financial results from the IPO of 8point3 Energy Partner should that occur in Q2.  Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First we continue to demonstrate impressive improvements in our technology. Our lead line average efficiency improved to 15.6% in the first quarter and is currently running at 16.3%, which creates a 3% energy density advantage relative to multi crystalline silicon. Our improved competitiveness continuously to manifest in our new bookings; we have booked 905 megawatts DC so far to date and with over 3 giga watts of mid to late phase opportunities we are seeing continued strong momentum in our business.  Finally, with the filing of the S1 for 8point3 Energy Partners our plan for joint YieldCo with SunPower remains on track. With these we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Patrick Jobin. Mr. Jobin, please go ahead. Patrick Jobin : Few questions here, first on gross margins 8.3%, just trying to better understand kind of the mix impacts of the module business versus the system business; I would have thought cost incurred for projects you\u2019re holding wouldn\u2019t be flowing through P&L at this stage. So I\u2019m just trying to understand that in context with the efficiency improvements, then I have a follow up. Thanks. Mark Widmar : The margin, for the project -- our self-developed projects that will be contributed to 8.3, correct, those are held on balance sheet and the cost associated with that are on balance sheet, but still does flow through into the systems businesses -- our third-party EPS business. So it\u2019s generally has been lower margin then we self-developed at anticipated, again we\u2019re stepping in EPC contractor versus the actual developer of project. So the margin utilization will be lower on that and then the other balance of it, obviously the margin that we realize today on our module-only sales are lower than obviously the future bookings will represent given the improved competitiveness for technology. Patrick Jobin : 2 megawatts of bookings, how many were systems versus modules? And then any update on TetraSun and ramping that? Thanks. Mark Widmar : Yes. We don\u2019t have a breakout of module versus third-party but you can tell that the start of booking we envision is mainly a module-only so that was a big chunk of it. So if you approximate something [indiscernible] of the total is probably reasonable assumption, is module-only the balance will be EPC, I\u2019ll let Jim talk about TetraSun. Jim Hughes : TetraSun, we continue to ramp production and complete the qualification and certification of the product and we\u2019ll start to have a product available in the market place over the next several quarters. So it\u2019s for the most part we\u2019re seeing exactly as we anticipated and we\u2019re very happy with the results of the product that\u2019s coming off the production line. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben Kallo : Good progress on the technology, I guess the question that comes up quite a bit is there is a thought out there is a solar panel is a solar panel and it\u2019s all the commodity. So how do you guys look at your technology improvement in differentiating yourself and how is that show through to the financials and to valuation for Solar? Jim Hughes : So, there is certain aspects of the business that are clearly commoditized and you can say sort of a panel is a panel, but in reality what it comes down to is your customer is buying the energy that the panel generates and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve focused in this call and in general we focus in our R&D and in our sales efforts, to focus people on the superior energy generation that you\u2019re going to get out of the product. The standard face value wattage of the panel actually tells you very little about what the panels are actually going to do in the field and the amount of energy that you\u2019re actually going to get from the panel. So in the real world of day-to-day, hand-to-hand that back in sales it\u2019s all about the energy generation of your panel and the cost effectiveness of our product as compared with our competitors is very, very strong. So not only do we now have a product that has greater energy densities than our competition but we have a lower cost structure than our competition so that allows us to be profitable and competitive in the marketplace and that\u2019s how we think about and that\u2019s what we focused on in terms of our research and development and that\u2019s how we -- what we focus on when talking to and selling to customers. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah : Jim, I think you guys have mentioned your cost has come down to below [447] per watt, at least for the lead efficiency panels. Can you maybe talk about how that allowing to when business especially with some of the utilities in the U.S. what kind of forward pricing you see in the market place today and how competitive you are versus some of the other players out there, maybe some of the other technologies as well such as wind and coal. Jim Hughes : So, let\u2019s talk about solar-on-solar competition first, so quite simply having the lowest cost structure allows you to compete for business, capture that business at a more attractive margin than your competitors. It\u2019s fairly straight forward analysis and formula. It also gives us pricing power to breakup in new markets. It also gives us pricing power to trigger new demand. The overwhelming impact on continuing reduction of prices on a global basis is increasingly utilities and commercial and industrial customers are seeing so with our as an attractive value preposition simply on its own. In the U.S. you had utilities that are increasingly moving towards natural gas as a large portion of the generation fleet and as they due to a forward resource planning fuel diversity generation diversity is an important part of the formula when you look at the prevailing prices in the market today which dependent upon what region of the country can be from anywhere as low as 0.4 or just under that to as high as $0.06 per kilowatt hour, when they look at that on a flat basis for 20 years and compared that to additional natural gas exposure even at today's low gas prices the general view is that makes sense as a portion of our total generation mix. So what you've seen in terms of this fairly large explosion of demand in the Southeastern United States is a result of that calculus, is a result of the market place understanding where pricing has gotten to and recognizing the value that it represents. We\u2019re seeing the same thing internationally, just as one example Dubai originally had plan to carry out a 1 giga watt program over three year to four year time frame the first phase of that program they were so enamored up the pricing that they received that they doubled the size of that ramp and have accelerated the remaining 1 giga watt to this year. So we clearly both in the U.S. and elsewhere we reached a price points where as compared with other sources of generation above just on absolute cost basis on an absence of commodity price risk basis and on a generation diversity basis it\u2019s a very attractive offering. Operator : And will go next to Julien Dumoulin Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Great. Excellent I wanted ask very briefly here when you think about the contracting cycle to get utility skill deals done in time for the ITC in U.S. what's kind of the last day if you will to get to the contract inked? Is it the second, third or fourth quarter 2015 and as you think about trying to get that full cycle to completion here and get those and work back from that. Jim Hughes : I think it's pretty hard to generalize because it's going to depend upon the size of the facility; it's going to depend upon the jurisdiction in what's the facility is located, that set the sort of the permitting and code requirements that you are going to have to meet. So I fully expect that on small utility scale plants; let say it's sub 20 megawatts in size we\u2019re likely to see opportunities to contract volume well into 2016 on the very large multi hundred megawatt projects I would think that we are over the course of the second and third quarter of 2015 we\u2019re probably seeing the end of the opportunities to contract those asset and it will be a pretty linear relationship in between those two extremes. So it all depends -- obviously permitting a facility in one of the counties close to population centers in California is a more daunting task than permitting a facility in [rural] West Texas. So there is a whole host of variables that are going to impact when that cut off starts hitting in terms of the last opportunities that contract and complete the construction within the ITC deadline. Operator : Will go next to Krish Shankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Shankar : Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them first one Jim can you talk a little bit about how you seek the PPA prices for utility commercial kind of trend either in Q1 or over the last 6 months how has the trend being? And if you can give some color base in the different geographies that will be very helpful. Jim Hughes : So the trends has continued to be down the -- it depend a lot on installation so if you are talking about contracts in the western region in the United States with high levels of installation we have seen prices between let's say $0.04 or just under up to $0.05 and the Southeastern United States are little bit higher due to the installation levels but broadly you are seeing overall power prices below 60 megawatt hour for a new generation of reasonable scale and everybody in the value chain is still making reasonable money at those price levels it just reflects that we all continued to drive cost out of the integrated plant on the module side, on the fixed balance of system side, on the variable balance of system side and on the capital cost side. So that we continued to see those prices come down. Operator : We will go next to Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two of them; I\u2019ll try to squeeze both of them in here quickly. First on the conversion efficiency what\u2019s the expected timeline for the lead line to be complete average, is it something to expect to materialize within the 12 months window and then maybe related to that, any reason why the lead line is test to moderate per your comments Jim of decreasing levels. And then the second question I had was on Caterpillar, the announcement there, will the economics on those sales resemble module-only margins and is there any potential recurring from those sales and then any potential quantification of what this could represent in terms of additional volume opportunity for you guys in 2016 and its first full year? Thanks. Jim Hughes : Sure. I\u2019ll let Mark tackle your first question. Mark Widmar : Yes, so the conversion efficiency, what we basically said this is the vast majority of the lead line improvements will be rolled out over the next couple of quarters. So you will see that happening here over the next quarter which is consistent with how we saw the announcement we made last quarter on our [58%] lead line efficiency, as you can see that starting to impact the current fleet average pretty well. As it relate to the next step function change in the lead line efficiency that there will be a step function by the end of the year but as most of these initiatives are, we generally roll out a change we\u2019ve been trying to stabilize across the fleet and then we look to the next step along the road map. So we\u2019ll see a little bit of movement in the lead line that will be towards Q4 end of the year before we\u2019ll see a dramatic shift moving by. Jim Hughes : And then on the Caterpillar transaction, I think you can expect that on this particular transaction the margin certainly initially will look like module-only sales. It\u2019s possible that as we get into the partnership in the business that can morph overtime and we can have a greater scope of participation. But to keep it simple and get the transaction paper the forces has been more along those lines. In terms of the size, the potential market is huge and the Caterpillar dealer network is vast. And I think for us to provide any sort of prediction or guidance as to what the volume could look like I just don\u2019t think we have enough visibility yet. We\u2019ve got to get out in the field and provide training and materials to the network of dealers and then once they begin to engage with their customers I think we\u2019ll have much greater visibility, but I don\u2019t think we have it at this point but the potential addressable market that it represents is vast. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Sven Eenmaa with Stifel, Nicolaus. Sven Eenmaa : First I want to ask in terms of your 3 giga watts mid to late stage project pipeline, how much of that is for COD days beyond 2016? Jim Hughes : I don\u2019t think we have -- we\u2019ve broken that out and provided that information. There is some of it that is beyond 2016 a fair bit of it is, not the majority but I don\u2019t think we can provide any greater specificity in that. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Edwin Mok of Needham. Edwin Mok : First is on the cut incremental point 9 mega -- giga watt of project that you guys spoke -- or shipment that you just booked, since last quarter on your presentation, how much of that is planned to go into your balance sheet as project versus things that you\u2019ve assigned to yourself self. And then my follow-up question is on expense side, with planned joint YieldCo and [fiscal] you\u2019ve mentioned should we expect expense to go up as those projects get -- gone away? Jim Hughes : I don\u2019t think I understand your first question correctly is how much of the year-to-date bookings would actually be associated with projects that we\u2019ll construct and then drop down in the YieldCo. So, the only thing I can say right now is that in our public filing is that we\u2019ve identified the initial portfolios of assets and we\u2019ve identified a potential growth of portfolio. We can\u2019t comment anything beyond that, but the current period bookings are not reflective of either the initial portfolio or the [indiscernible] portfolio. So we have yet to determined based off of the opportunities set that we have in the bookings for the first quarter. What the ultimate monetization will be and we will value with that overtime and make the appropriate decision like us. The expense question is, we\u2019ve incurred more transaction expenses in Q1 as you can imagine legal tax accounting other one-offs has the transaction, we\u2019ll continue to incur those cost up until the IPO. Once the IPO launches you shouldn\u2019t think of any incremental expenses being incurred by First Solar and there will be expenses in mandatory service agreements that will be provided to 8point3 Energy Partners, but those will be compensate properly by 8point3 Energy Partners. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Paul Coster : Just quick question, as we move forward I\u2019m expecting the pipeline to shift towards maybe emerging markets little bit more, as that happens and you build a pipeline with projects outside of North America in particular, outside of OECD countries. Are you going to start to hold back projects there as well or are those all build to sell for the time being. Jim Hughes : If you look at the filling we did the F1 filing, there are definitions of qualified assets primarily relate to OECD type of countries that could be evaluated and we\u2019ll make those decisions over time if the economics of that look attractive and it's compelling to include into 8point3, we\u2019ll do that; if we think we can capture better economics by monetizing them with local cost of capital available than we potentially will take that path. At this point in time we have the optionality we\u2019ll continue to do that as which makes the most sense to pursue. Operator : Q - Mahesh Sanganeria : Yes. Thank you very much. A question on gross margin, I think you have implied guidance so just like mid or slightly below that the gross margin. I just had a general question on gross margin going forward. I think industry wide we see something that 15% to 20% goal gross margin on the projects and you probably have some headwind from the module, so a low to mid double digit is that a good place to model and also if you can comment on where are you targeting gross margin on the drop downs? Jim Hughes : So on gross margin, first up as the gross margin is up sequentially we don't provide the actual gross margin, but if you back into it you\u2019ll show that relative to Q1 will see a sequential increase in gross margin. If you go back and what we said historically is that we anticipate that's the normalize margins for the business overtime will be in that 15% to 20%. So that's not anything that is inconsistent with what we said, now as the module cost continues to improve we may see margins that are outside of that range, at the module only level. But I think it's probably safe to say that 15% to 20% is kind of how we\u2019re currently envisioning the business to evolve overtime. And related to expectations around dropdown of assets into YieldCo and expected return on that, we know not made any comments in that regard nor will in this point in time. Mark Widmar : The other comment I want to add is you have to bear in mind if you compare us to other industry participants they don't have an engineering procurement and construction business you\u2019re not going to be able to do a direct comparison we could take a 100 megawatts of module and sell them module only at a very -- what looks like a very attractive gross margin. We can package those same modules into an engineering procurement and construction contract that's at a much lower gross margin percentage but at a much higher total gross margin dollars and so it's very hard to look at our results in the aggregate and make a direct comparison to the other participants that are largely module only sales as opposed to having the significant engineering procurement and construction component. Operator : And will take our final question from Colin Rusch of Northland Capital Markets. Colin Rusch : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunities to sell into the merchant marketing was a number of projects as you go forward this YieldCo, are you seeing significant opportunities in your pipeline and how should we think about that leaning into the percentage of business going forward? Jim Hughes : When you say sell into the merchant market you talking about sell un-contracted power plan on an un-contracted basis, sell to power merchant or are you referring to something than else? Colin Rusch : Pardon, me I said emerged. Jim Hughes : Did you say emerging okay, sorry my mistake. Alright you address this. Mark Widmar : So, there is lots of optionality as we continue to address the best 8point3 Energy Partners and we will look at emerging markets because we have a merchant plans in Chile right now and looking at the best path to monetize that asset that clearly could be a path that says that 8point3 is the best ultimate position of where we would want to monetize that asset. We've got assets in Japan that we\u2019re developing; we\u2019ll be looking at those as well in terms of what is the right answer to do that. So what I would say is it's given us significant optionality, it creates somewhat of a competitive tension so that other when we get them to a point of having to sell down an asset, there is a competitive tension and there is a fallback position and then negotiations concludes, obviously it\u2019s advantageous to us because if we don't believe that market\u2019s willing to pay the proper returns over the value that they are getting from that asset then we obviously have different path choose. So that optionality views are help on our negotiation. So I do see it will involve more time again, if you look at what we\u2019ve included in the S1 it's mainly U.S. assets initially; how overtimes and I think you will start to see some diversification with international market. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the Question-and-Answer Session. And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Arthur Su - Needham & Co., LLC Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investor section of the First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Steve Haymore - Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2015. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investor section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update, then Mark will discuss our second quarter financial results in detail and provide guidance for 2015. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings call. This past quarter was marked with great execution across multiple aspects of our business, from the successful launch of 8point3 Energy Partners to the achievement of a new technology milestone. And with strong financial results for the quarter, I am very pleased with the progress we are making. I want to recognize the tremendous efforts of the entire First Solar team to achieve these results. Turning to slide 4, I will discuss in more detail the benefits of the newly formed 8point3 Energy Partners, which we launched in conjunction with SunPower. The creation of this YieldCo vehicle benefits First Solar and its shareholders in several ways. First, it lowers our cost of capital even further. Next, ownership in 8point3 allows First Solar to retain residual interest in high-quality solar assets while providing stable future cash flows through IDR rise and dividends. Additionally, the creation of 8point3 provides another competitive buyer for our future projects. Lastly, the $284 million in proceeds received from 8point3 subsequent to the IPO provides capital for further investment in project development. Mark will discuss more details related to the specifics of the transaction later in the call. We also achieved a significant milestone this past quarter related to our technology roadmap. As announced last month, First Solar achieved yet another new CadTel full size module record of 18.6% aperture area conversion efficiency, which has been certified and recorded by NREL. This equates to a full area efficiency of 18.2%, which exceeds the record multi-crystalline PERC module full area conversion efficiency of approximately 17.7%. Our new module record demonstrates our ability to scale our research cell technologies to full production form factor and is indicative of future production capability we will be deploying in the coming few years. With this latest achievement, we're clearly demonstrating that our CadTel technology is both a high efficiency and low cost offering. We continue to see our ability to execute on our technology roadmap as a key strength and a differentiating factor between First Solar and the competition. Slides 6 and 7 provide a slightly different view of our technology roadmap and expected energy density advantage relative to multi-crystalline silicon in the United States. While the energy density slides we have shown in the past have focused on typical Desert Southwest environment, this map shows the advantages across the country. As a reminder, energy density takes into account not only module efficiency, but also temperature, humidity, and shade tolerance advantages inherent in our technology relative to multi-crystalline silicon. As we transition from the end of 2015 to the end of 2017, we continue to expect that our module technology advantage of our multi-crystalline competitors will grow dramatically. As shown on slide 7, our advantage is expected to be especially strong in the more humid and hot parts of the country. With 1.3 gigawatts of volume either supplied or under contract in the Southeastern United States, we are already beginning to see the market appreciate the performance advantages of our technology. Finally, while the maps shown are specific to the United States, the same fundamental energy density advantage is present internationally and especially in those hot and humid regions that are best suited to solar. Turning to our current modules in production, our fleet average efficiency improved in the second quarter to 15.4%, a 70-basis-point improvement from the first quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.2% for the quarter, a 60-basis-point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a remarkable 210-basis-point improvement versus Q2 2014. The year-over-year increase in our lead line efficiency puts into perspective the astounding pace of our technological improvements. During the second half of 2015 and into 2016, efficiency improvements on our lead line will not be as dramatic as the first half of this year. This is due both to the need to prioritize full production utilization in 2016 as well as the timing of when new programs roll out. The efficiency improvements will accelerate again into 2017 as highlighted on the energy density map. Lastly, we still expect to see significant improvement in our full fleet average during the second half of this year as our lead line technology is rolled out across our production fleet. We are encouraged by the progress that we continue to see in our bookings, as highlighted on slide 8. Bookings for the first two quarters of the year now total 1.3 gigawatts DC against shipments of 1.3 gigawatts DC during this same time period. Since the end of Q2, we have contracted an additional 80 megawatts of volume to bring our year-to-date bookings to 1.4 gigawatts. We are pleased with our year-to-date bookings and our one-to-one book-to-bill ratio and have visibility into a large number of late stage booking opportunities. As we indicated previously, we are sold out for the remainder of 2015. As we look to 2016, we have already contracted most of our available supply for the first half of the year and based on a probabilistic analysis of our pipeline, we have only a few hundred megawatts of supply remaining for the entire year. This could lead to foregoing some bookings and pipeline opportunities due to supply constraints. We see this as a positive result of our improving module technology as well as the ongoing development of our global sales teams. Our recent bookings in late stage opportunities that are in final negotiations highlight our strengths both in project development and in continued growth internationally. First, in the United States, we were awarded a 100 megawatt PPA by NV Energy for our Playa project which has a COD of 2016. This project award highlights both the competitiveness of solar power with conventional fuel sources and the strength of our cost reduction roadmap. The project, as with other such awards, is subject to final approval by the state public utility commission. In addition, we expect to sign in the near future PPAs for several additional projects totaling hundreds of megawatts. While we are not able to discuss these in full detail today, the CODs on these projects are several years in the future. The delivery timing for these projects is a strong indication that solar power will remain an important part of the energy mix for utilities in the future, irrespective of the ITC expiration. We also see this as a positive indication of how our efficiency and cost roadmap positions us to have an extremely competitive product offering for projects with COD several years away. As we continue to execute on our roadmaps, we expect to be in a situation where we can capture a significant share of the market opportunity. Lastly, each of these projects are candidates for an eventual drop-down to 8point3. Internationally, we had tremendous success during the quarter, as highlighted by the signing of our largest non-U.S. module supply agreement for a single project in the history of the company. We have signed an agreement with ACWA Power and TSK to supply 200 megawatts AC of modules to the second phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai. This brings our total of completed or contracted projects to over 260 megawatts AC in the Middle East region, and further strengthens the leadership role we are establishing in this key growth market. In addition, the selection of First Solar technology highlights the competitive advantages of our CadTel technology in hot climates and locations with adverse soiling conditions. In Honduras, we are nearing completion of a 26 megawatt AC power plant that we are constructing for Grupo Terra. Central America is an emerging region for solar power and this project represents a sign of progress in a growing region for solar. Elsewhere, we added additional bookings in other international locations such as India, Turkey and Japan. Turning to slide 9, our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion compared to $7.3 billion at the beginning of the year. The decrease is primarily a result of the higher mix of module or module plus deals in our year-to-date bookings. Turning to slide 10, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 16.7 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Despite over 500 megawatts of bookings, our late stage opportunity stayed flat at about 3 gigawatts, with the increase coming from early stage projects. Nearly half of our late stage opportunities, which we define as projects with a greater than 50% likelihood of converting to a booking, are international projects. On slide 11, we are providing an update to our potential bookings opportunities by geography. Our opportunity set outside of North America increased significantly to 10.4 gigawatts, or 62% of the total. The latest growth in bookings opportunities since the prior quarter are from the Latin America, India, and the Middle East regions. These developments are encouraging signs of our efforts to diversify outside of the U.S. Turning to slide 12, we have recently announced some internal organization changes in support of our new vision 2020 strategy. Vision 2020 is a long-term roadmap to achieve significant growth objectives and further establish our technology and cost leadership. As part of this strategy, we will focus on key geographic regions that have a market-driven need for utility-scale solar power, and where we can compete effectively with fossil fuel generation sources. Executing this plan will require prioritizing global market opportunities based on our core strengths and allocating resources appropriately. While we will have more details of our vision 2020 at a later date, I do want to address some of the leadership changes that have occurred in support of this plan. First, we have appointed Georges Antoun as President U.S.; and Joe Kishkill as President, International. This organizational change will improve our focus on key markets while driving sales growth. Joe will also take on new responsibilities as he joins me and Mark Widmar as members of the newly formed Office of the CEO. The Office of the CEO has been created to facilitate a distributed decision-making architecture for the company. While Mark will also take on additional responsibilities, his role as CFO remains unchanged. As a result of Georges moving to the U.S. leadership role, Tymen de Jong will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer. Tymen has already been an instrumental part of implementing the technology improvements across our module manufacturing operations, and he will now be able to leverage his experience to achieving even greater cost improvements across all of our operation and execution functions. Tim Rebhorn has been named Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategic Marketing, with responsibility for competitive positioning of our products and services, institutional development, and management of global key account relationships. Lastly, Raffi Garabedian will now report directly to me and his role as CTO is unchanged. I am very confident that these changes will better align the organization in order to further drive sales and operational excellence. Finally, as an update, our next Analyst Day will be in 2016. We will provide more specifics around the timing later this year. Now, I will turn it over to Mark who will provide detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss guidance for 2015. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. Let me begin on slide 14 by discussing our second quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 563 megawatt DC, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased manufacturing capacity. Production was 26% higher year-over-year due primarily to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency, and new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization declined by two percentage points from the first quarter to 85% due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet. As Jim noted, our second quarter average module efficiency for our entire fleet was 15.4%, an increase of 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and 140 basis points higher year-over-year. Our best line averaged 16.2% efficiency during the quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter, and 210 basis points year-over-year. Putting the year-over-year improvement into perspective, the 210 basis points improvement results in a 15% increase in nameplate watts per module. We are pleased with the rollout of our new module technology across the entire fleet and we expect the fleet average to approach the best line efficiency later this year. I'll now turn to slide 15 to discuss the P&L. Net sales in the second quarter were $896 million, nearly double the prior quarter sales of $469 million. The sharply higher sales resulted primarily from the sale of our majority interest in the North Star and Lost Hills projects to the Southern Company, as well as increased revenue recognized from our Silver State South project. Note that Silver State South revenue recognition is on a percentage of completion basis while North Star and Lost Hills were sold to Southern near the end of construction, resulting in nearly all of the revenue recognized in Q2. Overall, construction activity and revenue recognition was higher across various EPC projects, which was partially offset by lower third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in our systems projects, was 98%, an increase of 20 percentage points from the prior quarter. Note, module plus sales, which include the modules in addition to other components such as mounting structures, is a growing part of our business and is included in our systems revenue. Module plus revenue totaled approximately $100 million in the second quarter. The decrease in third-party module sales reflects lower shipments to India as compared to the prior quarter. Gross margin in the second quarter was 18.4% compared to 8.3% in the first quarter. The improved gross margin percent benefited from higher volume and improved sales mix led by the sale of the majority interest in Lost Hills and North Star. In addition, gross margin improved from cost reductions across multiple systems projects. Operating expenses for the second quarter, which includes plant startup, decreased sequentially by $2 million to $107 million. The decrease was driven by lower R&D expenses, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses associated with higher project development spending that was not able to be capitalized against project. In Q2, operating expenses included an additional $4 million of expenses associated with the launch of 8point3. Second quarter operating profit was $57 million, compared to an operating loss of $70 million in Q1. The increase in profit was due to higher sales and improved gross margin. There was an overall tax benefit of $33 million in the quarter. This primarily resulted from a $42 million anticipated discrete tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority which we noted in last quarter's earnings call and included in our guidance for the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $94 million or $0.93 per fully diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.62 in the prior quarter. Relative to our guidance for the quarter, our actual earnings were above the high end of our EPS range, primarily due to strong cost savings across multiple domestic and international projects. In addition, the percentage of completion on our Silver State South project was higher than forecasted for the quarter, resulting in additional revenue and earnings. Turning to slide 16, I'll now discuss the balance sheet and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by $291 million to $1.8 billion. Our net cash position now stands at $1.5 billion, an increase from $1.2 billion in the prior quarter. Increase in cash in the quarter resulted from the sale of majority interest in North Star and Lost Hills as well as the $284 million received from the 8point3 IPO. Our net working capital including changes in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased slightly by $28 million from the prior quarter. Deferred project cost decreased from the prior quarter due to the North Star and Lost Hills sales, but was offset by increasing non-current project assets related to projects under construction. Stateline, Moapa and Luz del Norte, which were respectively 26%, 32%, and 72% completed at the end of the second quarter, are the major projects that fall into the non-current project asset category. Total debt increased from the prior quarter by $57 million to $300 million. The increase is from an additional drawdown on the project level debt associated with our Luz del Norte project in Chile, partially offset by scheduled payments on our Malaysian debt. Cash flow used in operations was $17 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $418 million in Q1. The $284 million cash received from 8point3, $239 million was treated as investing proceeds and $45 million was treated as financing proceeds. Free cash flow was a negative $47 million compared to negative free cash flow of $466 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled approximately $39 million, a decrease of $17 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation from the quarter was $63 million, a slight increase from the prior quarter. Now, turning to slide 17, I will now address the accounting impact to First Solar's financials in the second quarter related to the 8point3 IPO transaction. As part of the initial portfolio, First Solar contributed four projects in return for 31% ownership interest in 8point3. Products contributed included minority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star, along with 100% interest of Maryland Solar. Note for clarity and as a reminder, when the sale of the majority interest in Solar Gen, Lost Hills and North Star occur, these transactions were recognized through the P&L as revenue, cost of sales and gross margin. Specific to Maryland Solar, the project was leased back to 8point3 in order to preserve the ITC benefit to First Solar. It was accounted for as a financing transaction due to our continued involvement in that project. Subsequent to the IPO, First Solar received $284 million in cash from 8point3, again, approximately $239 million of this amount was accounted for as reduction of First Solar's investment in 8point3 and the remaining $45 million associated with Maryland Solar was recorded in other liabilities. It should be noted that this transaction was treated as a contribution of assets in return for an equity interest, and there was not any \u2013 there was no P&L impact during the quarter. Additionally, in Q2, First Solar did not receive any earnings related to our 31% ownership share in 8point3. However, any future 8point3 earnings we recognize in our equity and earnings in our P&L. Next, let me address the accounting for future dropdowns of assets to 8point3. Note that we do not plan to drop any additional assets to 8point3 during the remainder of this year, but we wanted to provide some guidance on the subject. First, it is important to understand that the GAAP accounting will vary depending on the specific structure of each transaction. However, in general, when we sell an interest in one of our projects to 8point3, there will be a P&L impact. The impact could be to revenue and gross margin or it could be to a gain depending on the timing and circumstances of that transaction. A key point to remember is that while the classification on the P&L may vary, the bottom-line's earnings impact is comparable in either situation. In the future, we may also sell projects to 8point3 that follow a traditional path equity structure. In these situations, the accounting may take an even different form. In the case where we do have different accounting arrangements on future dropdowns, we will evaluate what measures are necessary to provide clarity to the investors. Generally, regardless of the structure of the dropdown, the economic substance of the transaction, which is what is most meaningful, is the same. We will monetize 100% of the value of the project either through, A, a sale of the majority interest to a third party and a minority interest to 8point3; or, B, through a sale of tax attributes to a tax equity partner and the residual value to 8point3. Regarding the project portions sold to 8point3, our expectation or at least the initial dropdowns is that we will receive 100% of the value in cash from 8point3. Over time, this may change and the consideration may be a combination of cash and 8point3 shares. Turning to slide 18, I will discuss our full year 2015 guidance. First, we expect net sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. As a percentage of our total revenue for the year, we expect systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in our systems project in the range of 90% to 95%. Next, we expect gross margin in the range of 21% to 22%. This implies a higher gross margin in the second half of the year as compared to the first. This is the result of both a favorable mix of systems projects and continuing module and BoS cost improvements. Operating expenses including plant startup are expected to range between $415 million and $425 million. As a reminder, the full-year guidance includes 8point3 transaction related expenses of $8 million, which we incurred in the first half of the year. Our projected effective tax rate is between 2% to 5%. Note that this rate incorporates the $42 million discrete tax benefit recorded in the second quarter results. Excluding this benefit, the tax rate would be approximately 12 percentage points higher. Earnings per share is expected to be between $3.30 and $3.60 per fully diluted share. Included in the earnings per share is approximately $0.16 of equity in earnings, net of tax which is comprised mainly of our First Solar ownership interest in 8point3. Our net cash balance is projected to range between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. In the second half of the year, we do expect to raise project level debt for the construction of our foreign assets in India and Japan, the loan balance to construct our Luz del Norte project is also anticipated to increase by year-end. As a result, we expect our year-end total debt to be approximately $400 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $175 million and $200 million. Working capital increase from the end of 2014 is projected at $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. The large increase in working capital for the year is a result of continuing to construct projects on balance sheet, primarily in support of the 8point3 identified ROFO projects. In addition, in some emerging markets where we are constructing development assets, we may be required to hold projects on balance sheet even after construction is completed. Lastly, we expect shipments to range between 2.8 gigawatts and 2.9 gigawatts for the full year. In regards to the guidance for the second half of the year, we anticipate a higher percentage of the remaining revenue and earnings to fall in the third quarter of the year as a result of the timing of expected project sales. It should also be noted that our guidance for the remainder of year does not include any further dropdown of assets to 8point3. Moving on to slide 19, we will provide sum of the parts valuation framework to illustrate how our view of how the investor community should consider valuing First Solar following the YieldCo launch. First, we see our core business continuing to be valued on an EPS multiple or discounted cash flow basis. With strong guidance for this year, one of the largest contracted pipelines in the industry and rapid technology improvements, we continue to see this as a growth engine of our business. Next, we add in our $1.5 billion of net cash, which equates to approximately $15 per share as of Q2. Further, we add the value of 8point3 to First Solar through our 31% ownership interest. Finally, our DP (27:14) ownership in 8point3 should be taken in consideration through future rights to IDRs. Turning to the next slide, I will summarize our progress during this past quarter. First, we believe we delivered strong financial results for the quarter with sales of $896 million, gross margin of over 18%, and earnings of $0.93 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net cash balance of $1.5 billion, and our recent amendment and extension of our revolving credit agreement, which has been increased from $600 million to $700 million with a maturity date of July 2018. The high end of our guidance range is $3.6 billion of revenue and $3.60 of earnings per share. Our technology continues to improve rapidly with our record module of 18.6% average share area conversion efficiency. Our pipeline continues to grow with 1.4 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings and several projects in late stage negotiations. Our potential bookings now stand at 16.7 gigawatts with 3 gigawatts of mid to late stage opportunities. Lastly, we've successfully launched 8point3 Energy Partners in conjunction with SunPower. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter and the guidance. First, can you talk about your high-level thoughts looking ahead for 2016 and then especially 2017 as there's a lot of concern around there out in the investment community. And then also tying that in, could you just talk about your efficiency gains during the quarter and for the rest of the year, and how that positions you versus your Chinese competitors from a cost perspective, because there's also this perception that you're losing your cost advantage? Thanks. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, first, let's talk a bit about what we see going into 2016 and 2017. As I said my comments, we're rapidly approaching a point where we don't have a lot to sell in 2016. That doesn't mean we lose the opportunity to create value. What we've found over the course of 2015 is that, as we get into a fully-allocated position, we begin to identify opportunities to move volume around, move projects around, change timing and optimize the value creation out of the full production capability of the fleet. So 2016, I think, as we roll through the next couple of quarters, we'll book the remainder of the year and then we'll spend a lot of the following year optimizing the deliveries and optimizing the timing of our projects. The final resolution of ITC and specifically the commence construction language for ITC could throw some curveballs at the industry and cause everybody to re-look at timing of projects and timing of deliveries, but we'll just deal with those issues as they play out in Washington, D.C. As for 2017, we've got a fairly good book of business post-2016. It is still early. As we've come to understand the rhythm and timing of the industry, we're still probably a couple of quarters away from when projects that are slated for 2017 will begin to aggressively engage on their module and EPC acquisition process. So I think we'll begin to get some visibility. I think our view, as we've stated before is, there will be some softness \u2013 some significant softness in the U.S. market. I don't think it disappears to a zero, but it will clearly be softer than in 2016. The effect of the expiration of the ITC has clearly been to accelerate demand from 2017 into 2016 on the North American front. Having said that, there's no impact on international demand as a result of the ITC, so all of our growing activity outside the U.S. continues to build on the solid base that we have, and we expect that that will grow on a fairly nice basis through 2017. As you all may have noticed over the last couple of years, some markets, India in particular, the bookings in that market tend to come very close to deliveries. We don't have a lot of advance visibility. We can predict based on the programs and our customers' activities, but in terms of them coming in as an actual booking, they tend to come relatively close to the delivery. So we're still a ways away from beginning to reflect that activity in our books. Some of the other markets are looking promising, but it's still a little too early to be able to tell. But generally, we expect a little bit of softness in North America, but we think we're going to see good activity elsewhere in the world. On the technology roadmap, there's been some recent commentary that is almost like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. I feel like I've been magically transported back to 2012 and reading about a fading cost advantage, et cetera. I have absolutely no idea, Ben, where that commentary is coming from. The modules that we are producing today are higher efficiency, higher quality, and lower cost than anything we've ever produced. And as we laid out and showed everybody over the last two years or three years in Analyst Days, we have a committed technology roadmap that we continue to deliver on. We have occasionally made adjustments to that roadmap, but they're primarily to accommodate our need to produce product. They're not because we've had any sort of difficulty at any point in converting our technology roadmap into actual production and performance of the product. So we are as confident today as we have ever been in terms of our ability to compete in the marketplace, and I think the gross margins we're seeing out of all aspects of our business reflect the impact of that technology in the marketplace. So I don't know, Mark, if you have anything you want to add. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah. The only thing I'll add on to that is that just to remind everyone what we said on the last call, we said with our lead line at that point in time north of 16% that we were \u2013 our cost per module was for those products were below $0.40 a lot, right? So we basically said at 16.3%, 16.2% cost of the module was below $0.40 a lot. Okay? We also just said that we now have a new module that certified of \u2013 north of 18%. As we indicated, the 200 basis points improvement that we saw year-on-year from our lead line represents an increase of 15% watts per nameplate label capacity, right? So when you take that all into consideration, and our efficiency roadmap is in such a way that we're able to drive to a higher efficiency, and it scales the cost down, so it's not incremental to the cost structure of the module on a cost per watt basis. So it's hard for me to get my head around how that can all translate into a disadvantage. We're being below $0.40 a watt today, and having a roadmap to get us north of 18% just on a pure cost basis. I can't see how that can create a disadvantage. And then when you couple that with the slide that we're showing on an energy density that we're 18% plus advantage in some parts of the U.S. on an energy basis in 2017, the combination to a higher energy and lower cost. I don't know how you conclude otherwise that we have an advantage. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Two questions. Maybe the first one is for Jim, and that is with this quite amazing energy efficiency roadmap that you seem to be executing against, how do you actually price projects with delivery in 2017 or 2018? Do you do so with the future vector efficiency in mind? Or is it some kind of compromise between today and that future state? And the question for Mark is, the yields have spiked in the YieldCo space and I'm just wondering what, if anything, this does to your 12% to 15% growth commitment for 8point3 and what, if anything, you have by way of sort of wiggle room? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. On the future efficiency of the product, we have a very, very involved and sophisticated management process whereby we continuously evaluate the technology roadmap on a multifunctional, cross-functional basis within the organization. We make decisions against a degree of competence and statistical analysis that allows us to decide what we're willing to commit on a forward basis further out in time. Obviously, within that, you're going to use a greater degree of conservatism versus your roadmap the further out in time you are. But we are continuously applying in the marketplace our view of the roadmap. And we do so through extremely rigorous processes and only commit technology to the promise that we're willing to make in the marketplace once we feel like we have a high degree of confidence that we have moved from any sort of R&D type of circumstance to where it is simply a matter of executing on the production side. And that's essentially the methodology that we apply. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : On the discussion around what's happening with yields and a YieldCo market environment and then what our assumptions are relative to our 12% to 15%, as we said, when we were on the road show is we clearly are looking at this as a sustainable long-term vehicle that positions us for success, and in particular, we're trying to make sure that we're positioning ourselves for success beyond the 2016 horizon in the U.S. And we believe we've done that by putting together a ROFO and an IPO portfolio that effectively enables us to deliver against that growth through 2018 timeframe. Now, we also said on the road show that we left ourselves significant degrees of freedom to make decisions over time if rate did increase or environment change. We could look at the growth rate, we could look at the payout ratio, we could look at the leverage. So we'll continue to evaluate all of those levers and try to make an informed decision of what makes the most sense to enable both First Solar and SunPower's business model. As you can tell by the recent announcements for both by SunPower and First Solar, we continue to both be successful in the marketplace and not only with COD dates in the 2016 horizon, which both of us won 100 megawatts with NV Energy with CODs in 2016. But as Jim indicated, we're in negotiations with opportunities for hundreds of megawatts that sit beyond the 2016 horizon, which is the combination of enabling the strength of 8point3 with our advantage technology roadmap will continue to position us to gain share in that horizon. And when we do that, we'll make a decision around what's the right way to monetize those assets. And it may mean to drop those assets down into 8point3 and it may mean we'll evaluate the growth rate over time. We'll do whatever's in the best interest of not only 8point3 shareholders, but each of the respective sponsors. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : At the moment, no deviation from the 12% to 15% commitment? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Not at this point in time. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Can you hear me? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, I guess when you think about the efficiency and the cost roadmap, what kind of pricing environment do you need in order to justify the YieldCo economics in 2017 in the U.S.? And also, as you think about international markets such as India, has your strategy changed around projects in those markets? Are you looking to acquire projects or develop projects, hold them on balance sheet and potentially drop down into a YieldCo? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So first, in terms of the forward pricing environment, we generally don't comment on that in these calls. So I'll kind of leave that for now. In terms of what we're looking at in India, we're continuously evaluating the markets in which we operate, and we're continuously and aggressively evaluating the capital markets as they relate to that specific market. Obviously, with a lot of the focus and attention on the TerraForm global offering, there's been lots of discussion about YieldCos being applicable to international markets. I think Mark and I have taken and the entire First Solar team, we've taken a fairly conservative and cautious wait-and-see approach. We think that it is entirely possible that over time you will see yields type vehicles developed that may relate to one or more markets outside of the United States. I think it is a product and an offering that will take investors a while to digest and understand, and I do think there are very real risks inherent in those products that will need a lot of thought and analysis as we move forward. So we don't have any immediate plans to do anything like that. We're taking fairly traditional approaches to the monetization of assets that we're creating in markets like India. But we also continuously look at new developments in the capital markets and the viewpoint and appetites that investors have for various things, and we will keep evaluating those things as we move forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about reports in the media regarding the company's targets on getting full system costs down to below a $1 a watt on a fully installed basis in Western U.S., where do you stand in the cost reduction curve currently? And what are the kind of key levers you have here, let's say, over the next 12 months to 18 months? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the target of getting down to a $1 per watt is a target that we announced a long time ago in one of our Analyst Day meetings and we continue to make good progress. We, as of the last year-and-a-half or so, have not really broken down the details of that as we believe that it's competitive information. But we continue to make good progress. And you will hit that target at different times in different markets. Each market has its own cost structure, its own cost of labor, its own specific requirements in terms of site conditions, and even within markets you have a high degree of variability. So safe to say there are certain places in the world today that you can build for \u2013 something close to or even slightly below a $1 per watt. There are other parts of the world where it is substantially higher than that. So it's not a universal, simple, single answer, but we continue, as you have seen on the module side, make tremendous progress and we've made exciting and significant progress on the balance of system side, and we continue to have a relentless, almost religious focus on cost reduction as sort of core to the company's success. Operator : Thank you. We move next to Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick questions. So first, just trying to reconcile running at 85% utilization, given the efficiency improvements, $0.40 per watt cost structure, I guess, with lead line and the commentary about being sold out, which is a little bit of volume for 2016. What would be a realistic upgrade timeframe and when we see that lead line throughout the rest of the fleet and utilization? And then just last question, on TetraSun if there's any update there. Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, I will take the first one and then Jim can do the TetraSun. So first off, Patrick, to make sure the comment was made during the call, if you caught it is that we envision that we will be running the entire fleet at the current lead line efficiency by the end of the year. So the 16.2% in the lead line, you would expect the entire fleet as we exit the year to be at 16.2% from that perspective. The comments around the utilization and the sold-out in the $0.40, to try to put that all in perspective, we effectively are running adjusted for downtime to realize upgrades that we need to do to drive those efficiency improvements. We effectively are running full outright now. We have no real available capacity. We have some discretionary capacity as it relates to the timing of doing the upgrade, and that's why you will see not this year, we're going to continue to roll out for the fleet, the lead line efficiency across the entire fleet, but as we enter into 2016, we're making some informed decisions to delay some of the roadmap enhancements in order to capture as much utilization as we can given the current demand profiles. So it's one of those things \u2013 it's a delicate balance. You have to look at where you are at with the efficiency roadmap, where you're from the relative competitiveness, and while we do believe, obviously, there's significant advantages that we'll gain as we continue to roll out our roadmap. But as we look at it today and then demonstrated it in the sides that we presented during the discussion today is that at our current 16%-type efficiency as we exit 2015, we will be advantaged in a number of key markets. And so now we've captured the advantage and we're trying to make sure that we can monetize that efficiently in 2016 and limit the amount of downtime. So you'll see a little bit of a delay in the roadmap and you'll see more of that activity happening in 2017. So again, it's a delicate balance between what do we run for utilization, how do we think through the efficiency roadmap, and where are we at in the relative competitiveness of our technology at that point in time. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On TetraSun, so we continue to ramp the initial line. We have also been taking the product through both the qualification processes with the international qualification bureaus as well as a very rigorous qualification process for the initial customer. We're close to completing all of those activities. We will produce something on the order of 25 megawatts this year and then we'll continue to run that line next year. We have a number of conversations with a variety of customers underway about the destination for that production, and our goal is to successfully operate that line, have very high yields, very high quality and deliver that product to a handful of customers over the course of next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So a question here just around 8point3 and the positioning of your development activities. Obviously, very successful abroad in more EM oriented countries or perhaps more specifically non CdTe (47:50) oriented countries. Can you talk about how you think about development and perhaps optimizing between going towards attractive EM opportunities versus pursuing development opportunities in developed markets which could be eligible for 8point3? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't really think it's an either/or. Given the balance sheet that the company has, as long as the activities are well diversified and at appropriate risk levels, we really aren't particularly constrained in terms of our ability to pursue development activities. And the resources to pursue emerging market activities or activities outside of the U.S. versus the resources that pursue U.S. activities, they are really not common resources. There's a little bit of overlap on the engineering side, but by and large, those are independent skill sets and independently staffed teams and organizations. We have a fairly regional structure on the development side. We further committed to a regional focus with the reorganization and the appointment of Georges as the U.S. President and Joe as the International President. So it doesn't really present us with an either/or. We're going to pursue development in both the U.S., other OECD countries, as well as emerging market countries based upon the market specifics, the ability to create value out of the development process, the availability of a liquid market to monetize those activities on the backend, and it's not \u2013 we don't \u2013 really have not found ourselves in a position where we have had to think about or talk about an either/or in terms of evaluating those opportunities. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. One is if I look at your 16.7 gigawatt booking opportunity, it looks like it's about 3 gigawatts to 4 gigawatts of mid to late stage. Is there a way you can quantify how many have COD dates before and after 2016? And the follow-up would be given your global footprint, I'm wondering, how has FX impacted your numbers? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So what was the last question again? Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : FX \u2013 impact of FX on your projects. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So first, in terms of the 16.7 gigawatt, we don't provide specifics, but generally, I can tell you that when you consider where we sit with respect to our production in 2016, there's going to be a significant volume of that that is post-2016 because we don't have a lot with which to chase opportunities in terms of available volumes, and that's probably all the detail that we can provide on that other than the numbers that are in the release. In terms of FX, the near-term specific FX exposures we try to identify and hedge, and we don't see a great deal of volatility. I think we have a belief that there is some competitiveness elements that flow through FX. We have probably a slightly more dollarized supply chain than some of our competitors. But I tend to take a reversion to the mean approach to that, and we don't spend a lot of focus on those types of issues. Mark, any? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : No. I think that's right. We have seen a little bit of FX benefit on Malaysian ringgit, it hasn't been significant, but to Jim's point, largely where we hedge most of our exposure, so we haven't really seen a net benefit or a net adverse impact for FX so far this year. Operator : Thank you. We move next to Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of policy related ones. First, if you could share maybe your latest visibility into the proceedings around the 50% RPS proposal in California and what you think the timing for progress on that might be. And then secondly, Jim, you alluded to it earlier in the call, but with respect to the 30% ITC, if you could share any thoughts around the chances for a Safe Harbor provision to be implemented, to the extent that you have any visibility into the proceedings in DC? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think I have less visibility on California and the 50% RPS. I mean, I think there's a tremendous amount of political will to get it done. I think that at that level, you are beginning to push the horizon to the point that there are practical issues associated with that level of penetration into the grid. They're not unsolvable. I just think it requires thoughtful analysis and dialogue, and I think that the resource planning process combined with the political process are kind of tied up in trying to figure those types of things out. And I \u2013 to be honest, I don't spend a ton of my time focused on it. We certainly have people within the organization that do, but I wouldn't feel comfortable providing a lot of commentary. On the ITC, there has been a lot of activity and a lot of discussion in Washington. As everybody knows, the fact that we are now in the heat of the 2015 presidential race kind of leaves us at a difficult time in terms of making progress on issues that require a lot of bipartisan support. There has been a lot of dialogue in the Senate about conforming the ITC to the same standard that applies to the PTC and providing commenced construction, determination for solar projects or alternatively to allow the solar projects to proceed under the same part as wind, which, the net effect of that would actually be the same thing. The House has not taken it up specifically. It would be unlikely to be included in any House legislation. It would get resolved to the extent a tax package moves ahead later this year in conference, and I do not consider myself enough of an expert that I can provide much insight into what the results of those conference negotiations would be. I will tell you that there's lots of effort and activity on the part of the industry and what we're really seeking with \u2013 for solar, specifically seeking is a smooth glide path with no sharp alterations in policy. We're not focused on long-term extensions of the ITC. We're just focused on trying to create a smooth transition and that's where most of our effort is. But I'm not one to provide a lot of prognostication as to what's going to happen or not going to happen in Washington. Operator : Thank you. We take Edwin Mok with Needham & Company next. Arthur Su - Needham & Co., LLC: Hi, guys. This is Arthur filling in for Edwin Mok. Just a real quick question. As you guys start to execute on your efficiency roadmap and achieve a higher level of efficiency, do you see yourself potentially entering the small commercial or residential market space? Thanks. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think our answer to that will be the same as it has been historically, which is if we have meaningful customers that are interested in cooperating with us and pursuing that market, we will be more than happy to work with those customers. We're not going to go directly chase those customers ourselves. That has never been our business model or our expertise. Our deal sizes tend to be much larger than that. Certainly, we have a technology that's going to be increasingly applicable, and we do have aggregators of demand that have spoken to us about those markets, and I think you will see us move some volumes into those markets, but that will be more in terms of module supply and less in terms of as a developer. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, guys, for the time. We feel like it was a good quarter and we have a very attractive and interesting future ahead, and so we'll talk to you all next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

(Broker) Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jon Windham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Sean He - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Good afternoon, and welcome to First Solar's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar website at firstsolar.com. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Steve Haymore - Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today the company issued a press release announcing its preliminary financial results for the third quarter of 2015. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investor section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update, then Mark will discuss our third quarter preliminary financial results and provide updated guidance for 2015. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. As indicated in our press release, we have issued preliminary financial results for the third quarter while we completed an analysis of a discrete income tax matter related to a foreign tax jurisdiction. While Mark will discuss this matter in more detail later I wish to emphasize that this matter does not have any adverse impact of the ongoing operations of the company. We are working towards a full and timely resolution of the issue. Now let me turn to an update on the business and the outstanding performance of this past quarter. In the third quarter, we had tremendous execution across all parts of the organization, which has resulted in strong results from a financial, bookings and technology standpoint. Before further discussing these points it is worth taking a moment to reflect on the progress we have made as a company over the past several years. In 2012, First Solar and the entire solar industry faced a period of disruption resulting from declines in unsustainable subsidized solar markets. At our Q1 2012 earnings call, we laid out a five-year plan and identified key 2016 financial targets to focus the organization and create value for our shareholders. As we near the end of year four of this plan with year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts, earnings guidance of over $4 per share and the strongest technology position in our company's history, it warrants recognizing the tremendous progress that has been made towards these objectives since 2012. With the Vision 2020 plan that we introduced last quarter, we will continue this pattern of setting challenging goals and working to achieve them. Turning to our technology performance in the third quarter, our fleet average efficiency improved to 15.8%, a 40 basis point improvement from the second quarter. Our lead line efficiency averaged 16.4%, a 20 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter and a 210 basis point improvement versus Q3 2014. The more modest improvements in the sequential lead line efficiency relative to prior quarters is a reflection of an intentional and temporary pause in new technology implementations. As we stated previously, we are completing the rollout of our technology upgrades across the entire fleet this year. In the first half of 2016, we will prioritize full production utilization in order to meet strong demand and then resume the implementation of new module efficiency programs thereafter. Next, we are very pleased with our progress in securing new business for the future. Slide five highlights our year-to-date bookings, which now stand at 3.1 gigawatts. With two months left in the year, we have already set a new annual bookings record and anticipate adding to this total before the end of the year. With at least 3.1 gigawatts of bookings for the year and projected full year shipments of approximately 2.9 gigawatts, we will once again exceed our goal of a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. Our total 1.7 gigawatts of bookings since last earnings call are not only impressive in size, but also reflect some positive indications of utility-scale solar demand in the U.S. after 2016. Approximately 60% or over 1 gigawatt DC of the total 1.7 gigawatt DC booked are projects in the U.S. that have commercial operation dates after 2016. Approximately 630 megawatts DC of this volume represents PPAs that has been signed with a leading utility in the western United States and span across four projects which are anticipated to commence delivering power into the utility grid in late 2019. As with other PPA awards, these projects are subject to final utility commission approval. More details will be made public at a later date regarding these projects. We also signed an incremental 400 megawatt DC module supply agreement with Strata Solar. All of this volume is scheduled for delivery to Strata in 2017 and 2018. We have now signed agreements with Strata for over 1 gigawatt of volume, which signifies the growing importance of our relationship and also demonstrates the strength of demand for solar in the southeastern United States. We are encouraged by these bookings with longer-dated CODs and see this as an initial positive indication, particularly with respect to volumes. We still remain cautious on expectations regarding margins after 2016, given the limited visibility we have into the solar business segment mix and the systems margins given recent uncertainty and volatility in respect to cost of capital for solar projects. However, we continue to believe that the growing affordability of solar, which is enabled by our cost roadmap, is an attractive value proposition for utilities. We also believe that the characteristics of utility-scale solar plants as long-term contracted assets with no commodity price risk will increasingly represent a compelling investment opportunity for a wide variety of investors and continue to drive low cost of capital for the industry. Looking at the remaining portion of the 1.7 gigawatts in new bookings since last call, approximately 650 megawatts are for projects with CODs during 2016. With the addition of these projects, we have nearly 2 gigawatts of 2016 volume fully contracted. When taking into account the significant number of mid to late-stage opportunities on a probability-weighted basis, all of our supply is fully allocated for 2016. The 650 megawatts of bookings are for projects that are primarily in the United States, but have a diverse geographical dispersion. In Texas, we have signed a 119 megawatt AC PPA with Austin Energy. This is encouraging progress in a state with excellent solar resources and significant growth potential. Additionally, this is our first major domestic PPA award outside the western United States and is evidence of the high priority we are placing on development activities in the south and eastern portions of the country. With a number of other potential bookings opportunities that we continue to pursue, we expect more success in this region in the future. Going further east from Texas, we are continuing to see even more success across the South and Southeast. Under a nearly 200 megawatt DC Module Plus agreement with Silicon Ranch, we will be supplying projects across states such as Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Florida, we will be supplying 163 megawatt DC of modules to Coronal (8:46) for three projects that will each utilize land leased from the military. These new bookings in addition to the volume we have contracted with Strata is growing evidence that customers recognize the strength of First Solar module technology in hot and especially humid environments. As we highlighted on last quarter's call, at the end of 2015 we expect to have a total energy density advantage as compared to multi-crystal and silicon of around 5% in parts of the South and Southeast. This energy density advantage represents a real increase in a solar power plant's output, which in turn translates to greater value to our customers. Also highlighting the increasing interest in solar across the United States is our signing of EPC agreements to construct three projects in Indiana with American Electric Power. While the combined volume of these sites is smaller relative to other bookings in the quarter, it is significant in that we are seeing utilities demand for solar continuing to spread across new regions of the country. It also marks the beginning of a new relationship with another leading utility. Earlier this month, we announced a supply agreement with Clean Energy Collective to provide modules and other equipment to four projects in Colorado and Texas. Combined together, these projects introduce the concept of community solar to nearly 1 million potential residential users. Last December we entered into a strategic partnership with CEC and this is a further step in that ongoing relationship. With a superior cost structure as compared to rooftop solar and an offering that greatly spans the potential for residential or business users to access solar power in collaboration with their electric utility, we remain extremely optimistic about the long-term potential of community solar. Finally, international bookings this past quarter included third-party module supply agreements in India, Vietnam, Turkey and Malaysia. Moving on to slide six. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue have increased to $7.4 billion. The revenue increase is due to the strong bookings for the year partially offset by a higher mix of module and Module Plus deals in the new bookings as compared to the year-to-date revenue, which has a higher systems project mix. Turning to slide seven. I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities, which have further increased to 17.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. The increase in potential bookings is especially impressive in light of a couple of factors. First, our bookings opportunities were reduced by the 1.7 gigawatts of projects contracted. Second, we removed projects from the potential bookings list that we will not be able to contract due to supply constraints in 2016. The fact that our bookings opportunities still increased despite these other items is a testament to the intense effort by our global sales teams. Continuing on, our mid-to-late stage bookings now stand at 3.9 gigawatts DC, an increase of 900 megawatts and a record number of advanced stage opportunities. International bookings now make up over 85% of the potential mid-to-late stage bookings. Moving onto slide eight, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography show a significant mix shift to international opportunities. The opportunities outside of North America are now 13 gigawatts or 75% of the total, the largest growth of bookings opportunities since the prior quarter were in India and Latin America. Lastly, as we mentioned on our last call, we're planning to hold our next Analyst Day in 2016. We expect that timing to be in the first quarter of next year following our Q4 earnings release. The specific date and webcast availability of the event will be shared at a later date. Now I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our preliminary third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2015. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : All right. Thanks, Jim. And good afternoon. Let me first address why we issued preliminary Q3 results today. As Jim indicated, there is a discrete income tax matter related to a holding company we have in a foreign jurisdiction. This item has recently come to our attention and we are working to complete our assessment as quickly as possible. It is important to note, this item is not a subject of an active audit or controversy with tax authorities, rather this is an internal evaluation of required mainly administrative compliance. Based on our preliminary analysis, the tax matter could have an adverse impact of up to $40 million. This issue is discrete and does not have an impact on our ongoing operations. Finally, it is important to highlight this matter does not affect any of our foreign tax holidays in place. We anticipate releasing complete financial results and filing our Form 10-Q on or prior to the filing deadline of November 9. Now turning to slide 10, I'll discuss our third quarter operational performance. Production in the quarter was 654 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 46% higher year-over-year due to the restart of manufacturing lines, higher efficiency and the addition of new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization increased by 9 percentage points from the second quarter to 94% due to the lower upgrade activity across the fleets. Our best line average efficiency was 16.4% during the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior quarter and 210 basis points year-over-year. Going forward, our lead line efficiency will remain essentially at this level until the next scheduled technology upgrades are rolled out after the first half of 2016. Our third quarter average module efficiency for the entire fleet was 15.8%, an increase of 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 160 basis points higher year-over-year. Second quarter end or since quarter end, we have made good progress rolling out the efficiency improvements across our production line and currently the fleet average efficiency is 16.1%. I'll now turn to slide 11 to discuss the preliminary P&L. We had record quarterly net sales in the third quarter of $1.27 billion, an increase of $375 million from the prior quarter. The increase in sales resulted primarily from the sale of majority interest in the partially constructed Desert Stateline project to Southern. This is the first quarter we have recognized revenue in Desert Stateline and all revenue since the project inception was recognized in Q3. Essentially, approximately 45% of the total project revenue was recognized in Q3. Going forward, revenue recognition will continue on a percentage of completion basis and our results will reflect the specific quarterly project activity until COD, which is anticipated to be Q3 of 2016. Revenue was also higher across multiple other system projects and third-party module sales. As a percent of total sales, our solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects was 95%, a decrease of 3 percentage points from the prior quarter. Module Plus sales which also include our solar power systems revenue totaled approximately $130 million in Q3, approximately 30% higher quarter-over-quarter. The increase in third-party module sales was related to volume shifts to India and revenue recognized on module sales to projects in the UK. Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1% compared to 18.4% in the second quarter. The significantly higher gross margin percentage resulted from a sale of majority interest in Desert Stateline, improvements in system project cost and a $70 million benefit from a decrease in our module collection and recycling obligation. Since the inception of the module end-of-life program, we have continued to pursue engineering and process improvements to reduce the cost of collecting and recycling the modules. Our continuous improvement efforts have resulted in an automated and continuous flow process, which is significantly lowering the cost of the end-of-life program. In Q3 we completed a cost study for our module collection and recycling program and determined the estimated future EOL obligation should be reduced based on our new continuous flow recycling process. While reduction in the current period is primarily related to module shift in prior fiscal years, the improved process represents a significant cost savings that benefit both First Solar and its shareholders. Additionally, in the third quarter we achieved significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt. While we no longer provide specific module cost per watt information, the impact of continued efficiency and throughput improvements are resulting in a substantial benefit. This can be seen in our Q3 component segment gross margin of 22% excluding the impact of the EOL change. Third quarter operating expenses, including plant startups decreased by $20 million from Q2 to $87 million. In addition to benefiting cost of goods sold, the reduction of our EOL obligation previously discussed benefited Q3 operating expenses by $10 million. In addition, startup expenses decreased associated with the 10% production ramp. Lastly, G&A expenses were also lower versus the prior quarter. The third quarter operating profit was $398 million compared to operating profit of $57 million in Q2. The improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved gross margin and lower operating expenses. The preliminary tax rate for the quarter was 13%. We had preliminary quarterly earnings of $3.38 per fully diluted share on net income of $346 million. This compares to earnings of $0.93 per share in the prior quarter. Moving onto slide 12, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased slightly by $34 million and remained at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. The increase in cash during the quarter resulted from the sale of a majority interest in Desert Stateline, partially offset by cash used for the ongoing construction of the projects that are being built on balance sheet. Note; on balance sheet we're currently constructing 1.2 gigawatts AC of projects, which will achieve commercial operation over the next five quarters. Our net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash in marketable securities increased by $55 million from the prior quarter. The increase was attributed to the increase in trade and unbilled accounts receivables, partially offset by reductions in inventories and payables. Total debt decreased from the prior quarter by $14 million to $286 million primarily due to scheduled payments on our Malaysian loan, partially offset by an increase of project level debt of $16 million. Cash flow from operations was $21 million compared to cash flow used in operations of $17 million in the second quarter. Free cash flow was a negative $17 million compared to negative free cash flow of $47 million in Q2. Capital expenditures were $45 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was $61 million or $2 million lower than the prior quarter. Turning to slide 13, I will now discuss our updated and preliminary full year 2015 guidance. The following guidance is preliminary pending the determination of the financial impact of the tax matter discussed previously. First, we have left our net sales range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion unchanged. We continue to expect our systems revenue, which includes both EPC and solar modules used in system projects to be in the range of 90% to 95% of the total revenue for the year. We are raising gross margin guidance 300 basis points to a revised range of 24% to 25%. This is a result of the favorable cost improvements achieved in Q3, as well as the benefit from the decrease in our EOL obligations. Operating expenses including plant startups have been lowered by $20 million to a revised range of $395 million to $405 million. In addition to the $10 million reduction from a decrease in EOL obligations, we are lowering operating expense guidance to reflect lower R&D testing costs and greater cost control focus. Our preliminary projected effective tax rate has increased to a range of 4% to 6%, reflecting our latest view of jurisdictional income mix. Note that this rate incorporates on a full year basis a $28 million net tax benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority. As discussed in our last call, the benefit of the favorable ruling in Q2 was $42 million. However on a full year basis the benefit is now estimated to be $28 million due to the decrease in our EOL obligation recognized in Q3. Preliminary earnings per share guidance at the midpoint has increased by nearly $1 per share to a revised range of $4.30 to $4.50 per fully diluted share. The increased earnings guidance reflects the $0.60 benefit net of tax from our lower EOL obligation, balance of the higher guidance is from operational improvements realized in Q3 results and included in our Q4 forecast. Capital expenditure guidance is unchanged at $175 million to $200 million. The guidance range for our net ending cash and change in working capital have changed slightly as we have narrowed the previous range provided. Shipment guidance is unchanged from our prior expectation. Lastly, consistent with prior indications, our guidance for the remainder of the year does not anticipate any drop downs of assets into 8point3. Looking forward to 2016, we are planning to host a mid-December call to provide guidance for the 2016 calendar year. Given the level of visibility we have into 2016 at this point, we feel that this would be an appropriate time to share our outlook with the investment community. The date and specific details of the call will be made available in the coming weeks. Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for the quarter, with sales of $1.3 billion, gross margin of over 38% and preliminary earnings of $3.38 per share. We have raised our full-year preliminary guidance range to $4.30 to $4.50 on the strength of our Q3 earnings and ongoing operational improvements. Our technology continues to improve rapidly, with the Q3 fleet average efficiency of 15.8% and a best line of 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow, with record year-to-date bookings of 3.1 gigawatts and the book-to-bill ratio for the year will be greater than 1-to-1. Potential bookings of 17.4 gigawatts has grown approximately 700 megawatts, even as we recorded record bookings. Our mid to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they've ever been, with 3.9 gigawatts of projects. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open up the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Great progress on the bookings and the cost front. You guys talked about 1-plus gigawatts of bookings beyond 2016. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how you think the margins and the backlog would look like beyond 2016? Given the efficiency improvement, can you maintain 15%-plus margins in the Systems business beyond 2016 or not? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Vishal, I think I made the comment that while we're getting increasing confidence with respect to volumes, I think it's still a little early for us to have a firm view on margins. And primarily because with respect to the Systems business, that's going to be dependent upon ultimate realization of those projects, which is going to depend upon the relevant discount rates and/or cost of capital. And with the dislocation we've seen in markets recently, I think my frank view is that through the end of this year there's going to be a degree of uncertainty on that. So I don't think we would want to comment. I think as we move into 2016, the capital markets should calm down and we should begin to get some visibility into where those discount rates are going to end up and that will give us better visibility into the margins on the Systems business. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : The other thing I would say, Vishal, is that the portion of that business on the Systems side, those that are projects that have CODs that are towards the latter part of this decade, which we've demonstrate with our past that when we are able to get control of assets with long-dated contracting periods like that with PPAs that are off into the horizon, that we've been able to increase significant value over that horizon as it relates to benefits that we've seen through introduction of our technology and other enhancements that we've made. So we feel confident with the large long-term margin capture that we'll capture on those assets. It's just a matter of, as Jim indicated, understanding how cost of capital evolves and how things in the market evolve over the next year or so. We'll probably get a better picture for how we've realized margin on those assets out further in the decade. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Could we move to the next call? Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Ben J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. A couple questions. First on the YieldCo front, how are you guys viewing the YieldCo at the current price? What can you do to support it? Second, some people will say Stateline helped you in this quarter and the cost cutting is done. Can you just talk about what more you can do to expand margin going forward? And I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Yeah, Ben. It's Mark. I'll take the YieldCo question and let Jim take the Stateline question. From YieldCo's standpoint, as we said on the 8point3 call a month or so ago, is both sponsors at this point in time are committed to the dropdowns that we would envision in the first half of 2016. We've also indicated that we do not have a need to raise capital at this point in time. We've left enough capacity in 8point3 to manage those anticipated dropdowns with the revolver, the late draw on the term loan plus the accordion features that we have embedded in the term structure. So what I would say we're still moving forward and we believe we'll be able to drop down those assets to create the right value equation to the sponsors and create accretion to 8point3. We'll continue to evaluate how the equity trades over time and we'll continue to assess how we would structure assets beyond, say, the first half of 2016. As we said before, we may look to put leverage on these assets, which would then allow us to create a levered yield to the 8point3 shareholder that is accretive. So there's other structuring options that we do have and we're continuing to look at, but beyond the first half of 2016, we would say we're committed on the dropdowns. We'll continue to evaluate the market and ensure that the dropdowns makes sense in the latter half of 2016. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. And on the other, while clearly we benefited from a project that's been part of the portfolio for a long time and everybody is known about, the operational performance this quarter clearly extends well beyond that. That's clearly had no impact upon the bookings side of the equation, which was the strongest quarter in our history from that standpoint. In terms of can we continue to drive margin and competitiveness through cost reductions? As I have stated regularly that's the religion around here and we have a cost roadmap that we remain committed to that extends well beyond where we are today. We've never backed away from that roadmap, and we've continued to hit the roadmap that we laid out several years ago. Further, we continue to spend robustly on R&D and we continue to build opportunities that will allow that roadmap to extend beyond the commitments that we have today, particularly outside of the module and into the balance of system. And then at the corporate level we continue to have a focus on growing the business, while at the same time getting leaner. And so we want to see our OpEx come down, not only on a unit basis but also on an aggregate basis, and so given how radically we've changed the business, the fact that we've maintained cost control from an OpEx standpoint I think is a notable accomplishment for the organization. So there's no doubt on our part that we have the ability to continue to drive competitiveness and not in some narrow fashion but broadly across the entire business, being very reflective of the decision to be vertically integrated and to give us the ability to target all aspects of the value chain. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : The other thing I would say is that, if you look at it, we took the guidance up as we indicated by about a $1, call it $0.35 or so of that being operational. None of that $0.35 had anything to do with Stateline. So if you want to look at it discreetly, we've always said that there's been lumpiness around the timing of revenue recognition in the Systems business in particular. You can look at it and say there was strength in the quarter supported by Stateline, but as it relates to the upside to the year, the operational benefit is not reflective of Stateline. Operator : We'll hear next from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, I have two questions unrelated. I'll just throw them in at the same time. The first one relates to the business you're starting to see in the Southeast and particularly U.S. projects that you might be seeing post 2016. What's driving it? Is it state level RECs? Is it renewable portfolio spend? Is it fuel replacement? Is it some combination of all of the above? And then the other question is you're obviously taking a break on upgrading the capacity because you're fully deployed. Does this also mean that we see a sort of break in the progress in terms of energy efficiency? Will you at the end of the hiatus come back and there'll be a step improvement in line efficiency at that point? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I'll tackle the first \u2013 the Southeast. I think there's a broad set of reasons. It has less to do with state RECs and more to do with cost structures getting down to a point where they represent a compelling value within the energy mix in that part of the country. As I've consistently said, there is a broad awakening on the part of utilities to the value that solar represents, and in particular as they look forward to the Clean Power Plan, as they look forward to constraints on the ability to operate existing coal plants or construct new coal plants, they see an increasing shift towards natural gas and accordingly a significant exposure to natural gas commodities. And while natural gas is very, very inexpensive today, everybody remains cautious and worried about future increases in that commodity. So it's broadly the ability to diversify their generation mix into a technology that is cost effective and affordable in the context of today's prices and also offers a significant hedge against future commodity prices. I think that it's that broad package of characteristics that is really what is compelling people to procure and utilities in particular to include photovoltaic in their generation mix. Your other question... Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : ...is on the efficiency James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: On the efficiency. So there won't be a step function because when we, again, we will continue to be working. We're continuously working from an R&D standpoint, but when it comes to implementation of each new advance, you can't initiate it across the entire fleet at the same time, and we're also very cautious about implementing too many advances in a single moment, because you have a great deal of difficulty. It's more challenging to track and determine that it is performing at production scale exactly the way you anticipated, and to make sure that from a quality standpoint you're delivering what you promised. So there's a risk management aspect to how many new advances you can throw into each iteration of the product. So you will see it go from flat to back to a relatively steep curve in terms of the advances, but I wouldn't describe it as a step function. Operator : Our next question is from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Two quick ones. Good job on execution and numbers for the quarter. I'm just wondering, the focus to go more international, is it part of the reason because the development landscape has cooled off a bit in the U.S.? And if so or if not so, what is the primary reason? And what kind of returns or margin should you expect on these international projects? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The reason for going international is that the last two and half decades that I've spent in the power industry have taught me that the power industry tends to be cyclical on a regional basis. Oftentimes those cycles tend to be non-correlated, and if you want to build a smooth, steadier business profile, you need to participate in multiple geographies, multiple economies, so that you have the ability to shift to whatever happens to be the area of greatest need. So it says less about the U.S. and more about the desire to grow, the desire to diversify the markets in which we can play. It also speaks to the fact that as our product has improved, as our efficiency has improved, as our spectral response has improved, we're just increasingly competitive across a broader set of geographies and that makes it possible for us to go out and compete in these geographies. So it's not one single discrete reason. It's part of a broader strategy to build what we believe will be a robust, growing, and steady business in the future. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : And I think just the other question you had on the returns, I look at it as a portfolio. So every region, every market has its own unique, I'll call it, margin entitlement for solar in general in terms of what it's competing against in terms of alternative sources of energy, other dynamics around how competitive our technology may be in a specific market given hot climate conditions, given humidity, given spectral response, given fuse lite (37:51). So if you look at it from a portfolio standpoint and you'll find in some markets the returns that we would see are a multiple higher than what we would see here in the U.S. In some markets they may be lower than what we see in the U.S., but on average, I would say that we're finding very robust returns that are comparable and generally could be stronger than U.S. Again, you have to look at it on a market-by-market basis, though Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Next is Jon Windham with Barclays. Jon Windham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking (38:26). Just quickly, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think you had raised 2015 EPS guidance by about $1.00 and you said $0.35 of that was related to operational efficiency and cost-cutting. Am I right to assume that the other $0.65 is related to Stateline? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : No, so what that is the other \u2013 and it's actually $0.60. I think we said approximately $1.00. I think the actual midpoint is probably $0.95. But $0.60 is the end-of-life obligation liability change. So it's based off a change in estimate. If you tax effect that benefit, it's around $0.60. The other $0.35 is just true operational performance. About $0.20 or so, $0.25 of it sits up in cost of goods sold as we're seeing continued improvements around costs per watt. Our engineering, EPC business and our overall ability to drive costs of our balance of system is improving better than we had anticipated, and then as Jim indicated, we're increasingly focused on managing our operating expenses. So we brought that down by another $0.10 or so. So it's a combination of great performance around manufacturing, EPC and then managing our operating expenses. Jon Windham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Maybe if I can ask... Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : Sorry, we lost you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very strong quarter. First I wanted to ask in terms of the commercial and industrial markets, what are you seeing there or what are the prospects there for you guys in 2016 and 2017? And second, in terms of your cost roadmap towards $1 a watt, what are the biggest levers here beyond the module cost reductions? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: First, on the commercial and industrial front, we do have some customers that are integrators and developers that will use our modules on commercial and industrial rooftops. It's not a gigantic focus, but there are some volumes. I think on ground-mount commercial and industrial, we see a robust set of opportunities. It's very hard for us to differentiate in the sales chain with a lot of our developers between utility direct purchases and purchases that are bilateral to commercial and industrial customers. Those two business classes look and feel exactly the same to us, there's not a big distinction. But we know there is a fair bit of it out there in the contracts that have been booked and signed recently. In terms of what levers do we pull other than the module, it's the balance of System. And it's all aspects of the balance of System from the structures to materials to material costs, to the means and methods of construction. When you look across labor and materials, they are both significant contributors to the balance of System cost. And we're spending a lot of time and effort on reducing labor, not just in terms of labor rate, but actually changing the means and methods of construction to reduce the number of actions and amount of time it takes to install, and reducing materials on the rest of the balance of Systems. So it's all about the balance of System when you get past the module. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : I think the other thing to point out in that regard, though, is that the balance of System is synergistic to the module. So as we drive up the efficiency of the module effectively, it reduces the variable balance of System that is needed to install every megawatt of energy that we put into the system. So you can't look at them in isolation. As we continue to drive efficiency up, it will naturally drive down the balance of System costs, and that will help us move towards the cost roadmap that we've laid out. Operator : Our next question is from Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Maheep on behalf of Patrick. A quick question on third-party sales for systems and modules. With more supply of projects seeking third-party buyers instead of being dropped down into YieldCos, has pricing dynamics deteriorated in the last few months for you? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Clearly there's a number of YieldCos that have indicated that at this point in time that they don't anticipate being aggressive or acquisitive in looking for projects. In some cases, they've indicated it could be over in the next year, it could be longer. But we have historically not sold to YieldCos or traditional tax equity structures. We've chosen to partner strategic with tax capacity. And so I would say that part of the market is still very robust, as you can see with our ability to sell down Stateline with Southern. Now what that means, though, is that more and more people will be looking to try to engage with the Dominions, the Southerns, the Berkshires, you can go on down the line, because they may be the most active buyers in the market. And what position of strength that we're in is that we have very strong relationships with a number of those parties. They obviously love the First Solar brand, they love the First Solar relationships, the level of comfort. And so I'm sure that there will be some impact in the market. I think we're in a fortunate position because we have very strong relationship with a number of those parties. But the other thing I would say is that these assets are very attractive. There's a number of parties that want to have solar assets, long-dated contracted assets with investment-grade counterparties, and the ability to acquire \u2013 or what will come to market in 2016 relative to potentially what could be in the market in 2017 and 2018 is there's a window that may be closing in terms of the number of projects that can be acquired. And I would expect at least a lot of our traditional buyers, strategic with tax capacity, it will be very aggressive throughout 2016. Operator : We'll hear next from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hey, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. So perhaps first quick question. As you think about the international mix here, can you comment about module versus self-developed projects, particularly in the new geographies and how you think about the incremental margin on those geographies? I know you got at that a little bit before. But are you thinking about these, have you've added new contracts as being truly development opportunities? Or for the most part should we be thinking about, especially India, as more of a module or Module Plus kind of opportunity? And then perhaps as a second unrelated question, I'll throw it out there now, the Southeast activity, et cetera, how much of that is PPP driven? And how much of an overhang is the early action credit being all the way out in 2020 limiting procurement? I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let's step back to development on the international side. So we look at each market discretely. One of the I think learnings over the last several years is that you cannot generalize about even within the same region, even neighboring countries, oftentimes you can't generalize about what the business mix for us is going to look like. So the way we think about development is, if we do development, we want to get paid for it, and when we say that, what that means is, is that we want to earn a return that's above and beyond whatever we believe the margin or Module Plus type of entitlement would be, if we're going to engage in the development process. And there are markets where we go and we see the opportunity to get paid for being a developer. And there are markets where we absolutely do not see that opportunity. So when you look across the world, Japan is a market where we have felt that we can get paid for being a developer, and we're very active in the development. India is a market where we feel we can get paid for being a developer, and we are active as a developer. What the difference is there are capital constraints in India that don't exist in other markets, that limits how much development we're going to be able to do. So we also were very aggressive on the module and Module Plus front in India. As we look at new and different markets around the world, there is an initial process that it takes us a little while to get on the ground and spend enough time in the market to really figure out whether there's an entitlement that's going to justify development. I think it's fair to say that at this point, our method of operation is let's lead with the module and then as we begin to establish a market share, get some resource on the ground and get a greater understanding of the market. We'll look hard at whether we think there's a development opportunity. But I don't think you can generalize, I don't think you could say, oh, all of the incremental demand internationally is going to be module only. That's certainly not what we're thinking about it, but I also think it's safe to say it's not all going to be development. Development is OpEx intensive. It is always complicated in a new market, and so we can only take on so many new markets at a time without driving our OpEx to unacceptable levels. And so it's going to be a balance between, okay, let's take the OpEx resources that we chose to live within, and let's apply those in the markets where we're going to get the greatest bang for our buck from a development standpoint, and then let's go with a lesser scope in other markets where we can capture market share on an OpEx light basis, admittedly at probably a lower margin, but still accretive to the overall outcome for the company. Operator : Next we'll hear from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Unknown Speaker : Thanks. Thanks, guys. This is Hank (49:25) on for Brian. My question was around nat gas prices and the trend we've seen in the recent months. How is that impacting the pricing discussions that you're having with customers for U.S. projects that could be potentially 2017 or 2018? I think there's a belief that PPA prices might go up in 2017 with the IDC, but what does lower gas do to that? Thanks. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Quite frankly, the front-month of natural gas doesn't really enter into the discussions. All of our conversations in the U.S. are 25-year \u2013 between 15-year and 30-year PPAs. So the utilities are looking in their integrated resource planning at their long-term curves, and I don't think their longer-term analysis has changed. If you assume that these low prices are going to pull rig counts down, when you look at the production cost and stack up the basins against that production cost, I think everybody gets to the same kind of levels when you get out 5 years to 10 years, and that is the point on the curve that is more impactful. If you got to a position in the United States where people believe that $2.50 gas prices were going to be the norm for the next 15 years, then I think that might change the discussion. But I don't think that's what people have in their mind at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Sean He - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is Sean He for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my question. On the Stateline project sales, I just wonder because we look across some other transactions Southern company has done, typically they require majority stake and take all the tax equity benefit. I just wonder if it's the same arrangement, maybe you can share more details on the transaction? And then as a follow-up, the minority interest in Stateline project, is this your plan to be dropped down to 8point3? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial & Accounting Officer : The way we structured Stateline is very comparable to the way that we structured some of our other assets where we sold the majority interest. So the structure is the same. Again the tax attributes are being monetized, 51% of the cash flows go with the majority owner, and then the 49% of the cash flows would come to First Solar, and again that's over the flip horizon, after the flip horizon that the tax and the cash are split the same way. At this point in time, Stateline is a (51:59) asset for 8point3 and we anticipate to achieve COD for Stateline in Q3 of 2016. We'll continue to evaluate the market, assuming the market economics makes sense and clearly that would be the intent of what we would do is we would drop Stateline into 8point3. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

LLC Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the First Solar's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - Investor Relations Manager : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update; then Mark will discuss our fourth quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the press release and the slides published today for a more complete description. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. 2015 was another remarkable year for First Solar, and we finished the year with strong operational and financial results. Slide 4 highlights some of the outstanding achievements from this past year. First, on the strength of our research and development efforts, we have continued to be the driving force in the advancement of CadTel solar technology. In the first half of 2015, we set cell efficiency and module efficiency records of 21.5% and 18.6% respectively. The cell record at that time represented the eighth substantial update to our record cell roadmap since 2011, and the record module efficiency placed us in a superior position to the best recorded multi-crystalline silicon module. Building on this success, today we have announced that we have achieved yet another new record cell efficiency of 22.1% as certified by Newport Labs and documented by NREL. At our last Analyst Day in March, 2014, we set a target to reach a 22% research cell efficiency milestone by the end of 2015. And with this announcement, we have delivered on that promise. The accomplishment validates our continued confidence in CadTel as a superior PV material that combines cost effectiveness, reliability and high performance. This achievement is also a testament to our world-class research and development team, which continues to push the boundaries of CadTel technology. Turning back to our 2015 performance, our full fleet average 15.6% for the year, which is a 160 basis point improvement from our 2014 average. In percentage terms, our full fleet average module cost per watt decreased by over 15% versus the prior year. Our EPC group also had tremendous execution as we installed more than 1.8 gigawatts of modules in 2015. This brings the total cumulative modules installed by our EPC group to over 6 gigawatts, and underscores our tremendous capabilities in providing power plant solutions to our customers. The performance of our global sales team was also outstanding last year as we booked a record 3.4 gigawatts DC. Compared to our shipments of 2.9 gigawatts, we once again exceeded our targeted one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. Our financial results for the full year were equally impressive with new record annual revenue of $3.6 billion, which resulted in earnings per fully diluted share of $5.37. We also closed the year with $1.8 billion of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, even while ending the year with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets representing projects on our balance sheet under development and in construction. While I am pleased with these exceptional results for 2015, as an organization, we will not grow complacent but are setting our sights on even greater success as we look at our long-term vision for this company. Next, let me provide a brief update on our technology performance in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, our Q4 fleet average efficiency improved to 16.1% or a 30 basis point improvement. This is the first time our full fleet has averaged above 16% for an entire quarter. Also, as expected, our lead line efficiency held steady at 16.4% as we did not implement any new efficiency process improvements in the fourth quarter. Turning to slide 6, I'll review our progress in securing new business since our last earnings call. With our 2015 bookings of 3.4 gigawatts and additional year-to-date 2016 bookings of over 160 megawatts, we have a remaining expected module shipment balance of 4.4 gigawatts as of today's call. Our book-to-bill ratio for 2015 was approximately 1.2, which exceeded our goal of a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio. Since our Q3 earnings call, we have booked 429 megawatts DC with the majority of this volume contracted in international markets, signaling the continued diversification of our business. A prime example of this diversification is in Turkey where we have recently booked third-party module sales of over 200 megawatts DC. The largest of these deals was a 100 megawatt agreement signed with Zorlu Energy which adds additional contracted volume to our 2017 shipments. We made further progress in Japan this past quarter with additional contracted bookings which now brings our total development pipeline in the country to nearly 100 megawatts. We see attractive opportunities in this market and continue to pursue additional project pipeline. The remainder of the international volume booked included an EPC project in Australia and third-party module sales or module plus sales in India and Africa. In the U.S., as discussed on our guidance call in December, we signed a 79 megawatt AC 20-year PPA with NV Energy, which was an expansion of a 100 megawatt plant signed earlier in 2015. All power generated by the combined 179 megawatt switch station will support switch's commitment to renewable energy in Nevada. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stands at $7 billion as shown on slide 7. The decrease in revenue from the beginning of the year is due to a combination of our record 2015 revenue recognized, assets drops to 8.3, and also due to a higher mix of module and module plus deals in the bookings for the year. Turning to slide 8, I will now cover our potential bookings opportunities which have further increased to 20.3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 2.9 gigawatts from the prior quarter. The sharp increase in potential bookings was primarily driven by a number of new opportunities that we are pursuing in the U.S. With greater certainty now in place related to the ITC, we are seeing an increase in opportunities. Our mid to late-stage bookings increased another 500 megawatts this past quarter to 4.5 gigawatts DC, which is a new record number of advanced stage opportunities. International opportunities comprise over 75% of these mid to late-stage bookings. Looking back one year ago to the time when our potential bookings opportunities stood at 13.5 gigawatts, the growth in our opportunity set to now over 20 gigawatts is remarkable. It is a testament to our global sales effort, as well as the increasing realization in the marketplace of the energy density advantage of First Solar technology. Moving on to slide 9, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography shows a significant increase in U.S. opportunities, as previously indicated. The portion of U.S. opportunities is now over 40% versus 25% in the prior quarter. Besides the U.S., we also saw an increase in potential opportunities in India. Lastly, we will be holding an Analyst Day on Tuesday, April 5, in New York City. At this event, we will provide an update on our strategic priorities. This includes the latest developments in our technology and operations roadmaps, our plans for growth and capacity, progress we are making in key markets and our latest business outlook. There will be a live webcast of the event available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Our executive management teams looks forward to the opportunity to provide the latest updates on our business and answer your questions. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark, who will provide detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss the updated guidance for 2016. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon. I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational performance on slide 12. In Q4, we produced (sic) 761 megawatts DC, an increase of 16% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiencies, increased manufacturing capacity and less downtime for technology upgrades. Production was 50% higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 due to the restart of certain manufacturing lines, higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. For the full year, we produced over 2.5 gigawatts DC, which is a 36% increase compared to 2014. Our factory capacity utilization reached 100% in Q4 which represents an increase of 6 percentage points compared to the third quarter and a 16 percentage point increase versus the same period in 2014. Capacity utilization increased in the fourth quarter due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. For the full year, our capacity utilization was 92%, an increase of 11 percentage points as compared to 2014. Our fourth quarter best line efficiency averaged 16.4%, which, as planned, was unchanged from the prior quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, our lead line efficiency improved by 160 basis points. Our fourth quarter average module conversion efficiency for the entire fleet was 16.1%, an increase of 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter, and 170 basis points higher year-over-year. Since quarter end, our full fleet efficiency has continued to improve and has averaged 16.2% quarter to date with an expectation of 16.3% by the end of Q1. For the full year 2015, our fleet average efficiency was 15.6% which represents 160 basis points improvement from the prior year. Continuing on to slide 13, I'll discuss the P&L results for the fourth quarter. Net sales were $942 million in the quarter compared to our record quarterly revenue of $1.3 billion in Q3. The decrease in sales primarily resulted from lower revenue on the Stateline project which achieved initial revenue recognition in the prior quarter. Net sales also decreased due to lower third party modules and module plus sales. As Jim indicated, we set a new record for net sales for the year of $3.6 billion, which was on the high end of our guidance range. As a percentage of total quarterly sales, our solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects was unchanged from the prior quarter at 95%. Module plus sales are included in our solar power systems revenue, and totaled approximately $60 million in Q4. Third party module sales were slightly lower in the fourth quarter with the majority of shipments to India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6% compared to 38.1% in the third quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage is due to both the lower mix of Stateline revenue and a benefit in the third quarter from a reduction in the costs associated with our module collection and recycling program. Our gross margin for the full year was 25.7% versus 25% at the high end of our projections. Our ongoing improvements in module cost per watt and balance of systems savings across our project portfolio were the major drivers of the gross margin guidance beat. The significant reduction in our fleet average module cost per watt in the fourth quarter and robust competitiveness of our technology is also visible in our components segment gross margin which reached over 26% in the quarter. Operating expenses increased by $13 million from Q3 to $100 million. Prior quarter operating expenses benefited from reduction in our EOL obligation. In addition, our R&D expenses increased as we continue to invest in our technology. For the full year, our operating expenses were $403 million, or slightly below the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter operating profit was $132 million compared to an operating profit of $398 million in Q3. For 2015, operating profit was $517 million, significantly above the high end of our guidance range of $490 million. The strong performance relative to guidance was primarily driven by favorable cost performance across our portfolio system projects. In addition, we were able to successfully avoid potential penalties on a couple of projects that had aggressive year-end completion requirements. We had a tax benefit of approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter, resulting from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. For the year, the tax rate was a 1% benefit, which included a $28 million net benefit associated with a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority highlighted in Q3. Our quarterly earnings of $1.60 per fully diluted share on net income of $164 million. Full year 2015 earnings per share was $5.37. Our full year results exceeded our guidance midpoint by almost $1 per share. Operational improvements accounted for slightly more than half of the upside to our guidance, and were primarily due to cost reductions realized across our project portfolio. Our operational strength and ability to scale our module and BOS cost improvements across our large system portfolio continues to be one of our key value drivers. The remaining beat of the guidance to the midpoint was from the lower-than-expected tax expense, which resulted from a favorable mix of jurisdictional income. Moving on to slide 14, I'll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities were essentially flat at $1.8 billion. Our net cash position was unchanged at $1.5 billion. Compared to the end of 2014, our cash balance decreased by approximately $160 million. We ended 2015 with over $1.3 billion in project-related assets, both in development and under construction. When taking into account the size of these assets, which increased by approximately $460 million year-on-year, it demonstrates how we have continued to maintain remarkable financial strength while still funding our project development activities. As a reminder, we expect a significant portion of the projects comprised in this balance to be sold by the end of 2016. For the quarter, net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased by $85 million compared to Q3. The increase was driven by higher project assets associated with our Moapa, CA Flats and various other projects under development. Total debt increased slightly from the prior quarter to $289 million. Cash flow from operations was $53 million compared to $21 million in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $20 million compared to a negative $17 million in Q3. Capital expenditures were $27 million, a sequential decrease of $18 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $60 million, or $1 million lower than the prior quarter. Turning to slide 15, I'll now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. As we indicated on our guidance call in December, the outlook we provided at that time did not incorporate an extension of the ITC, and that such a change could lead us to extend some project schedules into 2017. The revised guidance now incorporates these updates after reviewing our development portfolio. The adjustments we are making to the development timing of projects benefits our business over the combined two-year horizon as the schedule adjustments will allow us to achieve a lower installed cost per watt on the construction of these plants. Specifically, we now anticipate achieving COD on our Cuyama switch station and the first phase of California Flats projects in 2017. While our guidance anticipates that we will recognize a significant portion of revenue and earnings on the first phase of California Flats in 2016, the other two projects will be recognized entirely in 2017. With this in mind, our net sales range has decreased approximately $100 million to a revised range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the push-out of some projects into 2017. We are raising the low end of our gross margin guidance by 100 basis points to a revised range of 17% to 18%. The gross margin improvement is as a result of better than originally anticipated module and balance of system costs for the year. As a reminder of what we indicated on our December guidance call, the net sales and gross margin guidance does not include the sale of minority interest in the Stateline project, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. We are selling a minority interest in Stateline; we expect the profit on the sale to be recognized in equity and earnings net of tax, not revenue or gross margin. The gross margin guidance range would increase by about 200 basis points if the transaction was treated as a typical sale. Operating expenses, operating income and our effective tax rate are unchanged. Earnings per share guidance is also unchanged. As a reminder, our EPS guidance included a gain of approximately $200 million net of tax from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. These two items do not flow through operating income but do impact net income and earnings per share. Similar to our previous guidance, the profile of net sales and earnings per share are expected to be approximately 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half. This profile is subject to timing of project sales, which could alter this expectation. We have lowered the expected ending net cash and operating cash flow ranges by $100 million compared to our prior guidance. This corresponds with the reduction in revenue guidance as the proceeds from these projects will not be received until 2017. It should be kept in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately $450 million from the expected sale of our equity method investment in Stateline, which will be treated as investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipping guidance remain unchanged. Our dropdown plans for 8point3 next year have changed slightly since our December guidance call. We anticipate three assets \u2013 Kingbird, Stateline, and Moapa \u2013 which are all part of the ROFO list to be dropped down in 2016. Kingbird will be in the first half of the year with the remaining two assets in the second half of the year. Cuyama, originally planned to achieve COD in 2016, is being pushed out to leverage the benefits of the ITC extension. Given the broader economic factors impacting the vehicle sector, the timing and execution of dropdowns to 8point3 is subject to market conditions. Turning to the next slide, I'll summarize our progress during the past year and most recent quarter. First, we delivered outstanding financial results for 2015 and recorded net sales of $3.6 billion, gross margin of 26%, and earnings per share of $5.37. We maintain our 2016 earnings guidance range of $4 to $4.50, even when adjusting some project schedules to capture better value on these projects in 2017. Our technology performance continues its ongoing improvement with a fleet average efficiency now over 16.2% and a best line at 16.4%. Our pipeline continues to grow with record bookings of 3.4 gigawatts in 2015 and a growing number of bookings in international regions. Our potential bookings of 20.3 gigawatts have grown 2.9 gigawatts. Our mid to late-stage opportunities are also the strongest they have been with 4.5 gigawatts of projects. With this, we've concluded our prepared remarks and open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : We'll take our first question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you for taking my question. You're operating at 100% utilization rate. You're intentionally pushing projects out into 2017. Can you give us some sense as to whether you're leaving money on the table intentionally, turning down business, and what your visibility into 2017 is starting to look like? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're not turning down very much business. The ability to push projects out has given us a little more flexibility in terms of available supply. And we continue to be very encouraged by the overall activity levels and the booking activity we're seeing or the near-term possibility of bookings that we're seeing with respect to 2017. Operator : We'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hello? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're here. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Wanted to just better understand your guidance in terms of what you're assuming for line upgrades and whether your previous guidance of 16.2% efficiency for the full year still holds? And also what kind of expectations you have for bookings for the full year 2016? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So, Vishal, on the efficiency, we \u2013 as we indicated we're at \u2013 right now at 16.2%. We'll finish the quarter at 16.3%. We'll ramp that up as we progress through the year towards our lead line of 16.4%. So as we indicated in prior calls, we are intentionally looking to optimize throughput and as a result of that we'll see less impact through our efficiency roadmap this year. So would we expect to see the 16.4% trend higher as we exit the year? Yes. It won't \u2013 but obviously clearly not to the order of magnitude that we saw in 2015, which basically represented 160 basis points improvement year-on-year. But as we've said before, we have a very competitive module right now. It's mid-16% efficiency with the energy yield that we capture through a temperature coefficient and spectral response. We're very happy with the competitiveness of our module. As it relates to bookings, bookings will continue to reflect ourselves and relative to our opportunity in our pipeline that we've identified. We're very happy with the growth that we've seen, now with over 20 gigawatts. We're happy with the 400 or so megawatts that we booked since the last call, and a very good mix, not only between system and modules, but between U.S. and international. So again, as Jim indicated in his comments, the sales team is doing an outstanding job leveraging the core capabilities and competitiveness of our technology. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had two quick ones. On the 3 gigawatts that you added to the bookings opportunity since the last call I've seen are mostly from the U.S., as you acknowledged. Can you talk to what's really changed since the ITC was extended? Are these new projects coming into the mix? Are these projects that were sort of on the fence already and you see more viability now with the ITC in place? And then relating to that, what sort of visibility just on lead times would you say you have for turning these opportunities into bookings in 2016 and 2017? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So the \u2013 it's a combination of a variety of those factors. The resolution of the ITC, I think more than anything else it's not any particular outcome with respect to the ITC. It's \u2013 but it's removing the overhang of uncertainty and allows people to run their models and be deterministic about what the financial conditions that they're going to be developing projects in. So it's allowed us to advance some of our own projects. It's allowed customers to advance their projects. It's firmed up what the financial environment looks like. The competitive environment has improved a little bit versus, let's say, 18 months ago. So it's a whole variety of factors. It's also a broadening of demand. So we are seeing utilities express a desire to begin to participate in solar on a broader basis. We've had some very large customers that we've dealt with for quite a few years now, but we're adding to the customer set, and we're getting inbound inquiries and seeing RFPs from other utilities. We're also seeing new developers come into the marketplace that are in new service territories that we've not seen activity before. So it's the cumulative effect of a fairly broad set of circumstances. It's not one single thing that triggered it. It's very broad and across the board. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I'd like to ask regarding mostly 2017. How do you think about the domestic versus international mix in that year, and how much of that will be kind of self-developed versus module/module plus sales? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think it's a little early for us to have specific visibility. We have ample opportunity sets in both markets. I think that we will see a larger contribution from the U.S. versus what we would've thought, let's say, 9 months to 12 months ago, as a result of the ITC extension and the firming of demand. But it's a bit of a horse race. We've got lots of opportunities and lots of customers and it's going to be a case of who gets their stuff out there opportunities over the finish line first with economics that look interesting. So it's a large opportunity set chasing a finite volume. So that's kind of the circumstance you want to find yourself in. So I think there are some very big opportunities, both in the U.S. and internationally that could dramatically impact what that mix looks like. And I think it's still a little early for us to have precise visibility into how those big opportunities are going to play out, and both in terms of do they get across the finish line, and then two, some of them have uncertainty as to timing whether they would be a 2017 impact or potentially a later impact than that. So it's a little too early. All I can tell you is we've got lots going on, both internationally and in the U.S. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. With the OpEx guidance being maintained at $380 million to $400 million, and with the ITC extension, can you speak to how much of your resources you're moving back to the U.S., and can you quantify the degree of international projects you may be leaving on the table or pushing out? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we're not changing our resource allocation at all. We've built, over the last several years, with a focus on reigning in OpEx and being a very lean low cost operation. We've also intentionally structured our operations so that we can leverage growth and future opportunities off of a given level of OpEx. We've spent a lot of time, debate, head-knocking internally over how do we build an organization and how do we structure the business we are pursuing from a strategic standpoint so that we can leverage against that OpEx level. And the way the organization has been built with the shared service centers we've built in some of our international locations, those resources and those centers can cost effectively support our operations whether they are in the U.S. or whether they are in almost any jurisdiction around the world. And so that gives us greater flexibility and relieves us of the need to redeploy resources. So, we try to centralize certain resources in shared resource centers and centers of excellence that can be deployed anywhere, and then we have local resources that are focused, and we structure both of those activities so that they can be leveraged against greater opportunities without having to add to OpEx. So, the proof that our efforts and concepts are working is the fact that we've been able to shift gears through this sort of changing market cycle without having to retool the organization. And it's given us \u2013 it's demonstrated that we built what we intended to build \u2013 which is a highly flexible, highly responsive organization that can adapt to changing markets and circumstances very quickly. Operator : We'll take our next question from Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Sorry to beat this to death here, just want to go back on 2017, if I can. Jim, I think you mentioned previously, the mix pressures moving away from systems in 2017. But with these two projects pushing out in the late stage opportunity set, mainly U.S. driven, potentially hitting 2017, should we think about that as no longer being a pressure or drag? Or could it be more of a positive element? And then just a follow-up item. You mentioned the competitive landscape has improved, so I guess some of the bids from a year ago or so, that were pretty aggressive that perhaps might not get finished, are you sensing any opportunity to kind of be the rescue provider or potentially rebidding some of those contracts as near term opportunities for you? Thanks. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: First, let's talk about the mix in 2017. I would say with the ITC extension, it does increase the addressable opportunities set on the system side within 2017. In addition, I think in certain markets such as Japan internationally we have a pretty solid systems opportunity set that is addressable in 2017. So, it's not a dramatic shift but there have been some increase in the relative weight of the two, I would say. In terms of rebidding assets or capturing stress in the marketplace, we've looked at a lot of stuff. I think that the final stories have yet to be told in terms of the resolution of some of the assets in the marketplace. And I think we are also taking a very cautious approach to how much risk we're willing to take on board, particularly how much counterparty risk we're willing to take on board. We have a lot of high-quality opportunities and I think we've, quite candidly, backed away a little bit from chasing stuff that's going to require us to take a bunch of risk. I think we're just continuing to execute down the path we were on and feel like that we can generate an outstanding shareholder result. That doesn't mean we won't be opportunistic and that doesn't mean that we won't see things. We're just taking a cautious approach. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good afternoon. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just talk broadly about, as you compete day-to-day against other players, you're obviously making really strong improvements in your products' competitiveness, but of course, the competition is trying not to stand still as well. I'm wondering if you can speak to trends in terms of the competitiveness that you're seeing for your product versus others. Are you seeing the, call it, the all-in economic value proposition for your product increasing in terms of its benefit relative to peers? Or are you seeing the competition remains intense and other products are nipping at your heels? At a high level, can you speak to overall competitiveness? James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, there's absolutely no doubt that the competition doesn't sit still. And they're endeavoring to improve their product at the same time as we are. However, if you go back to late 2012 through today, the rate of change of our efforts versus the competition is clearly significantly higher. And this is something we'll spend some time on at the Analyst Day. But we have clearly been improving the relative value proposition, improving the margin entitlement, improving yields, energy density across all markets and we've been doing so at a higher rate of change than our competition. I can't speak to what they're going to do in the future, but we believe that we have a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of continuing to drive our roadmap. And we'll talk a lot about that at our Analyst Day. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones. One is, Jim, if you look at the utility scale market in the U.S., or especially where you guys are targeting, the PPA prices have come down over the last several years. In California and Nevada we're hearing like $0.04 a kilowatt hour PPA rates. Do you think that's at a floor level for PPA, or do you think there's more downside to these pricings? And the second follow-up is, out of your 20.3 gigawatt pipeline, how much of that is modular? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So on the PPA pricing, I don't think we're at a \"floor level\". What you have to bear in mind is there's two primary components that drive that pricing, and one is the capital cost of the project itself. And that's both the module, the balance of system and the development costs which includes land, interconnect permitting costs, et cetera. The other is the cost of capital, and that's the return demanded by the debt and equity investors in the project. There's no reason to believe that cost roadmaps are not going to continue to decrease as we move forward in the future. Now, I do think you will see some tendency to asymptote a little bit. I'm not sure the rate of change will be what it was several years ago. But there will continue to be benefits moving forward. What is harder to predict is, where are the capital markets going, what is the required rates of return on the part of investors, and when there's going to be. And that's a little more of a crystal ball type of exercise. But if you assume constant capital cost, then there's no reason to believe that PPAs would be at a floor. And then on the mix of that, I don't believe we've ever shared the mix on that opportunity set. So can't comment on that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: All right, thanks for taking my question. So, Jim, just following up on that question with your answer regarding the cost of capital, obviously, we've seen like increased cost, cost of capital in the energy space in general. How do you guys think about that in terms of running your business and how that impact, and specifically in certain parts of solar, it seems like cost of capital has gone up pretty fast. Have you seen more competitors try to go into the utility scale as a result of that? And then just quickly any update on the TetraSun? Thank you. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in terms of the way we think about it, we have always had a very deep pool of investors that we have tapped or to monetize the assets. Those investors' expectations in terms of return, we've seen variations over time, but the amplitude of those variations has been relatively mild. And we've also always been relatively conservative in terms of what we've baked into our modeling in terms of what we could achieve in the marketplace. So the way we think about it is, it's obviously a critical element to our development process and so we spend a lot of time making sure we are in touch with the market, making sure we are in touch with our customers, making sure we have a sense of what's happening out there. And we certainly recognize it as an exposure if we didn't pay close attention to it. But we feel like, and we've demonstrated over the last several years, that we understand the market and we know how to price our products so that we have the ability to monetize effectively. So, it's sort of, yeah, it's a big issue and it's a big risk, but that's core to succeeding in our business. And so managing that risk and understanding that risk is core to what we do. And there was a second question... Stephen Haymore - Investor Relations Manager : TetraSun. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, TetraSun. We'll have more comments about TetraSun at Analyst Day. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much, guys, for sneaking me in here. Can you talk a little bit about your pricing power in the market right now with both the module and module plus products as you see the efficiency improvements? And then could you just also give us the delta on underlying cost of capital assumptions on the guidance that you just provided? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial Officer & Director: So as it relates to pricing power, it all relates to energy density. And then what we have been trying to communicate over the last few calls, and we've demonstrated the advantage that we have not only here in 2015, but where we are going into 2017 and beyond. And obviously we are pricing forward with that type of advantage. So when you think about the spectral response advantage, the temperature coefficient advantage and \u2013 which ultimately drives to an energy density advantage in the upwards of high-single to low double-digit advantages, right? So we have quite a bit of pricing power relative to the technology. We have the advantage of the First Solar bankability and strength and the quality and reliability, and the willingness to stand behind our product over the long run. So I think that does translate into significant value in the marketplace. As it relates to the second \u2013 the last question Steve, I'm trying to remember the last question. Stephen Haymore - Investor Relations Manager : In terms of cost of capital. James Alton Hughes - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Cost of capital. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Financial Officer & Director: Yeah, the cost of capital assumptions, we're not going to get into specifics around that. It varies by region. So as we think about what our cost of capital assumption is in Japan, it's dramatically different than what it is in the U.S., which is dramatically different than what it is in India. I wouldn't say that we're assuming any significant changes relative to current environment. We believe it will be relatively stable, maybe slightly higher in some regions. But we don't go into the specifics of what that assumption is by region. Operator : That does conclude the presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Steve Haymore : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2016. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Widmar, Chief Financial Officer. Jim will provide a business and technology update; then Mark will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It's now my pleasure to introduce Jim Hughes, Chief Executive Officer. Jim? James Alton Hughes : Thanks Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Before we discuss our first quarter operational and financial results, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the leadership transition we announced earlier today. As you may have seen in our press release, after four years with First Solar as CEO, I have decided that I will step down on June 30 and hand the rams over to our current Chief Financial Officer, Mark Widmar, who will assume role of Chief Executive Office at that time. As part of the transition, I will continue to support the company in an advisory role and as a Member of the Board of Directors. The board and I worked jointly on the company\u2019s leadership succession plan and Mark was our first and best choice as CEO as for Solar enters its next phase of growth. Mark is strong and capable leader with an extensive knowledge of our business having served as First Solar\u2019s Chief Financial Officer since 2011 and as First Solar\u2019s Chief Accounting Officer from February 2012 through June 2015. Mark and I have worked closely together over the past four years and I expect a seamless transition. I have deep confidence that the company will be in good hands. It\u2019s been a privilege to leave the First Solar and I am proud of the significant milestones we accomplished as a team. When I joined First Solar in early 2012, the company faced significant challenges from both industry specific and macro-economic factors. My intent from the start and my commitment to the Board of Directors was to work with First Solar leadership to establish a strategic plan that place the company on a trajectory of sustainable success. As our most recent Analyst Day demonstrated, we have accomplished what we said have to do it four years ago. We not only achieved our goals but we exceeded our expectations. I\u2019ll remain excited about the opportunities ahead for First Solar. With that let\u2019s turn to our results. I\u2019ll begin by briefly reviewing our first quarter operational and financial performance. First our 30 manufacturing lines ran at 100% capacity utilization and produced over 770 megawatts of modules in the first quarter. Our Q1 fleet average efficiency continued to improve climbing to 16.2%. Our lead line efficiency continues to hold steady at 16.4% as new efficiency process improvements are not slated until later in the year. Coming off our recent Analyst Day where we laid out a higher compelling technology roadmap and potential capacity expansions, this represents an impressive start to 2016 and to achieving the objectives outlined at that meeting. Turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll review our latest comparison of books versus year-to-day shipments. We ended 2015 with 4.2 gigawatt DC of expected future module shipments. In the first quarter, we shipped over 800 megawatts of modules against this total and it booked 600 megawatts of new volume. Of the 600 megawatts of new bookings, around 400 megawatts were booked since last earnings call in late February. The largest single booking was the previous announced module supply agreement of over 200 megawatts DC with Silicon Ranch for delivers to their projects which schedule for construction in 2017 and 2018. This agreement is another positive indication of the strength of solar demand in the South Eastern United States beyond 2016. International volume was an important component of our bookings since last earnings call with volume contracted in several different countries. In India, we signed a module agreement for almost 100 megawatts DC of additional volume. As announced recently we achieved a major milestone in this market with now over 1 gigawatt of volume sold in the India. These new bookings add to our strength in this growing solar market. In Honduras we signed an agreement with Grupo Terra to provide modules and EPC services for 25 megawatt AC solar project. This is the second project in Honduras, we have constructed for Grupo Terra and further expands our presence in this region. For the balance of the year, we continue to see a number of domestic and international opportunities that would move us closer to a one to one book-to-bill ratio. In the U.S. the ITC extension has led to an increase in overall opportunity but customers continue to work through revisions to project timing which has led to some temporary delays in new contracted bookings. Potential international opportunities continue to be strong as well with the decision timing on a number of projects returning in the second half of the year. In addition, while the majority of bookings thus far in 2016 have been primarily module sales. This is timing related as we are pursuing a number of systems booking opportunities during the balance of the year. For example in our mid to late stage potential bookings, we have over 450 megawatts of opportunities with offerings ranging from AC power block to a full power plant. In our early stage opportunities if we focus on the projects with the highest booking probability, there are over 500 megawatts of additional potential systems bookings. In each case, these are projects with 2017 CODs and the majority of shipments occurring in that year. Note, then in addition to the more than 950 megawatts of opportunities discussed, there are large number of other early stage systems projects with lower probabilities that may materialize as well. Our bookings in terms of expected revenue now stand at 6.4 billion as shown on Slide 5. The decrease in expected revenue as a result of the timing of new bookings thus far in 2016 and the higher mix of module only business compared to the revenue recognized in Q1. Now this include revenue on any module sale or systems project that we have contracted. However, it does not include our contracted O&M revenue. Slide 6 provides the updated potential bookings opportunities which is now over 23 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 3 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late stage bookings opportunities are 3.1 gigawatts DC with international opportunities across 20 different countries comprising almost 90% of this number. Moving on to Slide 7, our updated potential bookings opportunities by geography reflects a net increase in opportunities across all regions. The largest increase was in the United States where new opportunities were identifying across multiple regions but especially in the South and South Eastern part of the country. We also had a significant increase in opportunities in the Middle East, India and Asia Pacific regions. The growth in opportunities in these regions plus the large number of mid to late stage international opportunities demonstrates the results of our multiyear effort we have made to diversify into new markets. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mark, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016. Mark Widmar : Thanks Jim, and good afternoon. Before I delve into the numbers, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heart filled thanks to Jim for his leadership and friendship over the past four years. First Solar is a strong company today, thanks to his guidance and dedication. I look forward to building upon this success in the future. From July, I\u2019ll hit the ground running and work with our Board, management team and associates to drive First Solar\u2019s next phase of growth while continuing still the strong results to our shareholders. In addition, we announced today that Alex Bradley has been appointed Interim Chief Financial Officer. Alex has served as Vice President of Project Finance since 2012 for the responsibilities for treasury group added last year. Alex has been with First Solar for eight years and with instrumental in launching 8point3 Energy Partners last year. I have tremendous confidence in Alex\u2019s ability step into the CFO role until permanent successor named. Now I\u2019ll begin by discussing our first quarter operational performance on Slide 9. In Q1, we produced 774 megawatts DC, an increase of 2% from the prior quarter due to higher module efficiency and increased throughput. Production was 43% higher compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to higher efficiencies, improved throughput and the addition of new capacity. Our capacity utilization remained at a 100% in Q1 and is 13 percentage points higher versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year for past utilization is due to fewer upgrade activities across the fleet. Our best line conversion efficiency remains unchanged at 16.4% as planned in our technology roadmap. Compared to the first quarter 2015, our lead line efficiency improved by 80 basis points. Average module conversion efficiency in Q1 for our entire fleet was 16.2%, an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year our fleet average conversion efficiency increased by a 150 basis points. As indicated at the recent Analyst Day, efficiency improvements are expected to pick up later in the year as we are targeting a full year average and lead line efficiency exit of 16.7% and 17% respectively. I\u2019ll next discuss the P&L results for the quarter on Slide 10. For Q1 net sales were 848 million in the quarter compared to 942 million in Q4. The decrease in sales results are primarily from the timing of revenue recognition across multiple systems projects and the completion during the quarter of our Tenaska West and Southern projects. Module plus revenue defined from the prior quarter while third party module sales increased slightly. Partially offsetting these decreases was the higher revenue on our Stateline project which resulted from an amendment to the original sales agreement with Southern to include an additional 15% interest in the project. This leads First Solar with the remaining 34% interest which is expected to be dropdown to 8point3 in the second half of the year. As highlighted at the Analyst Day, the sale of this incremental interest in Stateline does not impact our full year guidance but thus have the effect of shipping earnings from the second half of the year into the first year. As percent of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in Systems project decreased to 93% from 95% in the prior quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 31% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter. The improved margin percentage resulted from the higher mix of Stateline revenue and significant system cost improvements. Our component segment gross margin improved to over 28% in the quarter and benefited from a lower module cost per watt. Operating expenses decreased by almost 2 million from Q4 to 98 million. R&D expenses were lower versus the prior quarter, partially offset by higher developments. First quarter operating profit was a 165 million compared to an operating profit of 132 million in the prior quarter. Other income and expense was 36 million for the quarter, primarily due to a 38 million gain from the sale and rebalancing a certain restricted investments associated with our module end-of-life program. The transaction was completed in order to better align the currencies of investments with those of the corresponding collection recycling obligation. The gain was approximately 20 million net of tax. Tax expense for Q1 was 34 million including the tax and the gain from the sale of our restricted investments. Q1 earnings were $1.66 per fully diluted share on net income of 171 million. This compares to earnings of $1.60 in the prior quarter. Overall it was a strong quarter for earnings and a positive start for 2016. We were able to settle an incremental legit in Stateline which now they straightens our ongoing relationship with Southern but also provides greater flexibility for 8point3. Our manufacturing system operations performed extremely well in the quarter and contributed significantly to the Q1 results. Turning to Slide 11, I\u2019ll now discuss the selected balance sheet items and cash flow summary. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately 50 million to 1.9 billion. Our net cash position also increased to 1.6 billion. The improvement was achieved while our project related asset balance grew to 1.5 billion from 1.3 billion in the prior quarter. For the quarter, net working capital including in the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities increased slightly as compared to Q4. The increase in project related assets was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. Total debt increased by 10 million from the prior quarter to 299 million as payments on our debt facility were more than offset by additional financing for international projects. Cash flow from operation was 50 million slightly lower as compared to Q4. Free cash flow was 30 million compared to 20 million in Q4. Capital expenditures were 52 million as compared to 27 million in the prior quarter. Depreciation for the quarter was 55 million or approximately 5 million lower than the prior quarter. Continuing with Slide 12, I will now discuss our updated full year 2016 guidance. First note the while, the strong Q1 results could be precede at the catalyst for a more substantial increase in our earning guidance is important to keep mind the factors that contributed to the revise guidance. First, the amendment to the original Stateline sales agreement did not impact full year earnings, rather it affected the timing of the earnings and the income statement presentation. In addition, we feel it\u2019s too early in the year to make more substantial updates to the guidance, but we have visibility to opportunities during the balance of the year that could result in making an upward revision, we believe a more measured approach at this time is proven. Turning to our guidance on net sales, we are keeping the range of 3.8 billion to 4 billion. We are maintaining the range primarily based on the expected accounting for the sale of Kingbird project, which we will reflect in our Q2 results. The tax equity structuring for this project sale will result in a partial deferral revenue. We will provide more information related to this transaction on the Q2 call, but for now we are highlight that is factor in holding the next sales guidance unchanged. Next, we are increasing our growth margin guidance range by a 100 basis points to a revise range of 18% to 19%. The gross margin improvement is a result of the amendment to the original Stateline project sale which result a movement of profit from equity in earnings to gross margin. In addition, the cost improvements in the first quarter have benefited gross margin and are reflected in the updated range. It is important to keep in the mind that the expected profit and the sale of our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline is still reflected in equity in earnings in our guidance. Operating expense is unchanged and operating income guidance has increased by 40 million reflecting the improved gross margin. The effected tax rate unchanged at 16% to 18%. We will increase the low end of guidance for share - earnings per share guidance to $4.10 and left the high end unchanged at $4.50. As noted on Slide 12, our EPS guidance included approximately 145 million net of tax form the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar share of 8point3\u2019s earnings. In additional, approximately $0.20 of other income, net of tax is included in the earnings guidance range from the Q1 sale of the restricted investments mentioned. The distribution of earnings toward the year is expected to be slightly less than 50% in the first half of the year although it is the subject to the timing of when certain project sales close. Our expected ending net cash balance is unchanged and operating cash flow range has increases by 100 million compared to our prior guidance. The increase in operating cash flow has a net zero impact to the overall cash balance as it is a movement from investing to operating cash flow. With the sale of an incremental 15% interest in Stateline to Southern, the cash associated with this transaction we treated as operating cash flow rather than the prior expectations of an investing cash flow from the sale of residual interest in the project of 8point3. Keep in mind that our operating cash flow guidance does not include approximately 320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline to 8point3 which we expect to be treated as investing cash flows. Our capital expenditures and shipment guidance remains unchanged. Related to our CapEx guidance in the year, it should be noted that included in this numbers approximately 130 million related to the launch of our Series 5 product which we introduced recently at our Analyst Day. Our dropdown plans for Kingbird, Stateline, and Moapa to 8point3 are unchanged. However, the actual execution is subject to market conditions. Following our recent Analyst Day, some has expressed concerns that we did not provide more specifics around 2017. I wish to reiterate that there are still a number of moving pieces and uncertainties related to 2017 which make it meaningful to provide an outlook at this time. Reality should not overshadow if there is significant opportunities and technology advances we have laid out in detail at the event. We feel the company is better positioned than at any time during the past five years from a technology, operations and balance sheet strength standpoint. And we look forward to many opportunities to come. Turning to the next Slide, I\u2019ll summarize our progress during the past quarter. First, we delivered solid financial results for the first quarter with gross margins of 31% and earnings per share of $1.66. We updated our 2016 earnings guidance range from $4.10 to $4.50, which represents a $0.05 increase of our guidance midpoint. Our technology performance continues at a strong pace with a fleet average efficiency of 16.2% and a best line 16.4%. We have booked 600 megawatt so far this year and we continue to see the number of opportunities increase and our potential bookings now stand at over 23 gigawatts. For the number of opportunities in the second half of the year, we see anticipated booking momentum to continue. With this we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our first question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah : Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Jim, congratulation. And Mark I wanted to just follow-up on your comments for 2017, I think you guys mentioned in the prepared remarks that there were 450 megawatts of systems bookings opportunities that you expect to be actually execute in the second half. So based on some of the backlog that you\u2019ve announced, should we sort of think about Systems business in the 800 to 900 megawatt range for next year, is that a good starting point? And then as you think about CapEx for next year, can you just maybe provide thoughts on how you think about - how we should think about CapEx and capacity ramp in the remaining this year and next year? Thank you. Mark Widmar : Yeah, so I think what we said is Jim\u2019s comments that was in our late stages I think was maybe about 450, we also indicated that if you look at the earlier stage projects these ones we return with higher level probability, there is another 500 megawatts or so in there. So there is a potential of about a gigawatt of bookings that can happen between now and the end of the year that will be Systems related. That also one reason why as we think about providing guidance for 2017 until we can crystallize those opportunities it\u2019s not meaningful at this point in time provide guidance for \u201817, so I just want to make sure you have connected those docs. But as it relates to next year somewhere in that gigawatt range at Systems level, that\u2019s probably about right, we\u2019ve kind of indicated that we would expect it to be maintained around that range at least in the foreseeable future trending upwards obviously as we start to ramp capacity. So I think that\u2019s the right way to look at it. You know CapEx you know I can just really point you back to what we said in the Analyst Day at this point in time, I mean we\u2019ve gave the view of what we see capacity expansion, we gave the view of what the associated CapEx would be for that capacity expansion. We haven\u2019t given discreet impact to \u201817, \u201818 versus \u201819. But I think the best to do is just go back and review the slides that we presented in Analyst Day, I think that will give you the color that you are looking for. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Tyler Frank with Robert W. Baird. Tyler Frank : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations Mark. I was wondering, could you discuss a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of overall demand trends in the U.S. and has pricing improved with the recent bankruptcy announcement of Southern Edison, has projects gotten easier to bid on? James Alton Hughes : So first let\u2019s talk about the impact of Southern Edison. At this point, I mean it gets too early for us to really be able to distill and impact of Southern Edison on the market. And I think the concerns at Southern Edison was pricing aggressively and impacting the market. I mean we\u2019ve really haven\u2019t seen that dynamic in the market for at least six to nine months as there is sort of financial distress has become apparent. So I don\u2019t expect any sudden change as a result of the filing. They at least on the North American front had been active of probably the last six to nine months. Generally what we are seeing in the North American market is very robust demand. I think we have a lot of customers and a lot of opportunities where customers are having to resort the timing given the ITC change and try to figure out what they are going to do, when and how their procurement programs are going to be built up, but the conversations are robust and the demand is there. So I think we all feel remarkably positive about the North American market. Operator : We will now take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. First if you take the 50-50 first half, second half guidance for the earnings mix, it does just fairly big downtick here in Q2 market realize you are giving quarterly guidance but can you help us what\u2019s the puts and takes that makes in timing that\u2019s driving that because even when you out the Stateline sale and equity gaining in Q1 you earned a bit dollar of EPS, so trying to reconcile there? And then second question, as you think about potentially adding new capacity, I know that fill up in the air but how much is really dependent on the visibility into new project demand and converting pipeline into project wins versus module only and with the U.S. be most critical in terms of their visibility and there are another region that you highlights is being the biggest impact moving through the year? Thanks. James Alton Hughes : Yeah, so when you think about the guidance we brought about 50% in the first half, 50% in the second half. So really where we are right now is kind of the transition of period for our Systems business, so we are starting to see projects such as somewhere takes out in the coin you know and even Stateline start to ramp down. But at the same time we are starting to see other projects like CA Flats, we haven\u2019t sold Moapa yet, we\u2019re expecting to sell Moapa in the second half of the year and then we are seeing our switch station project start to ramp up in the second half of the year well. So it\u2019s really - it\u2019s a ramp down of some of our Systems projects have been in construction over the last year and then we don\u2019t start to see a ramp up with the new assets until we start to enter into the July timeframe. So it\u2019s a transitionary period. So we\u2019ll see more module only type of and module plus type revenue in the second quarter, so you\u2019ll see a slight drop in earnings associated with that. In terms of capacity, visibility, you know it\u2019s - as we\u2019ve always said, it\u2019s going to be driven by highly reliable predictable demand and so it\u2019s a demand driven you know pull versus a capacity push. And you know we\u2019re starting to see obviously not on here in the U.S. but internationally a significant you know increase in demand in our pipeline - it was reflected in our pipeline and you can see there is a lot more international. So it\u2019s not necessarily discreet to one particular region, it\u2019s not discreet module versus systems and you know so it\u2019s a holistic comprehensive analysis of the global demand and expectations across multiple product offerings and ultimately kind of and form our view around the capacity and the right time to add it. Mark Widmar : Just a couple of follow-on you know one thing to understand about the Systems business even though the ITC got extended, we had our large number of system projects that we slated for delivery in 2016. And some of those had PPA requirements such that even though the ITC was extended, they still had to be delivered. So we had what I will call an unusual alignment of deliveries at the end of 2016 and that leaves a bit a gap until you can redeploy your work force, start new projects and get those projects to the finish line and that\u2019s a little bit of what we are seeing. We\u2019re seeing plenty of demand but normally our Systems business the project sort of roll off in a steady rate as opposed to all being aligned to a single point in time. So it\u2019s a little bit of a historical function of the ITC. The ITC fall off that never happened but it got extended. And so I think that\u2019s you know just an important thing to keep in mind. The other is, one other things we tried to highlight at the Analyst Day and I think people need to try to get it greater understanding of it, we\u2019ve got a number of factors coming together in terms of our production platform. We\u2019ve got our new product are rolling out in the form of the Series 5. We have a new product under development in the form of the Series 6. There is a lot of complicated decisions if we need to make about the production platform related to those and we\u2019re trying to make sure that we\u2019re thoughtful, careful and detailed in our analysis. So it\u2019s not as simple as what\u2019s the demand and when do you build the plant to supply it. It\u2019s more complicated equation because we\u2019ve got new products in the equation. So we\u2019ll respond the demand when and where we see it and we will also communicate to investor when we have a clear view of what our plans going to be. But as we always have been and we are always going to be a little bit conservative and a little bit thoughtful about putting those plans together. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster : Yeah, thanks. So Jim, you alluded to the next phase of growth, if you kind of step back from things and characterize the last phase and how it\u2019s different, how the next phase will be different from that. Can you sort of try and summarize that for us? James Alton Hughes : So the last four years, we had a couple of overwriting factors, they drove a lot of what we are trying to accomplish as a company. One was, we wanted to restore cost leadership and substantially improve our technology and that was an overwhelming sort of focus on what we wanted to do. In addition you had the potential ITC fall away which created a very significant distortion in the market place and you were trying to plan around that distortion. And it\u2019s not an easy business task to sort of blow those two together and figure it out. As I look at the task that Mark and the team going to talk on over the next four years, we have a much clear view see demand with no big distorting events within the next sort of four to five year time horizon at least that we know about today. And we have a position of technology leadership that we\u2019re going to increase upon as oppose to try to get back and achieve. So I think it will be a little less lumpy and feel a little more robust and perhaps the last four years where we have a lot of challenges to overcome which we successfully working. I think this is less about overcoming challenges and more about capitalizing upon the strong incredible opportunities that are out there for the company. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Sven Eenmaa : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about the international growth into \u201817 and if you prioritize for us the markets where we see the system and module business coming in in terms of bookings in the second half of this year? And the second quarter relates to Southern Edison, are you seeing some of those PPAs in assets which are now in a bankrupt company backlog coming back to the market there COD dates have been missed? Mark Widmar : So, I\u2019ll take the international growth one and I\u2019ll let Jim sort of - he already committed on, so I\u2019ll let him add a little bit more color on that. But - what you said I think on the international growth side of it is you know are late stage opportunities that\u2019s in our pipeline, about 9% of that is international, so you get little bit 3 gigawatts and 90% of that is actually international. It is relatively diverse. It\u2019s in a number of markets. I mean we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity clearly in India but we are starting to see more activity across Asia Pacific, seeing activity through the Mideast, we are starting to see, we actually are close to signing an agreement in South American for about 40 megawatt. So there is a lot of opportunities even in part of South Africa. So it\u2019s a very diverse and that\u2019s we wanted to see. I mean over the years, we made a decision to invest in our demand generation in our sales team and we felt that overtime we will create diversity of the demand profile and then that starting to show up and it\u2019s reflected in our pipeline, so it\u2019s not anyone discreet market, it\u2019s pretty robust and that\u2019s we what to see that type of diversification. James Alton Hughes : And what was your question on Southern Edison? Sven Eenmaa : In terms of there is obviously that and did you had the number of projects in I guess backlog where PPA were signed and we are at a stage now where the questions are made whether these projects will be delivers based on their original CODs. And there my question was whether you are seeing actually utilities coming back and resourcing our finding alternative sources for those requirements, generation requirements in the market? James Alton Hughes : So I think everybody is going to get a bit of an education on the bankruptcy proms so over the next six to nine months. The bankruptcy court has broad powers to deal with contracts and entered into. And utilities will not be able to terminate those contracts even if they have the right to do so without the approval of the bankruptcy court. So I think what we will see happen is there will be a long period of uncertainty and I personally don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a lot of progress or a lot of definition around their project for certainly the next three to four months and probably closer to six months. And then as the credit estimating and the bankruptcy state works through, all of the mechanics of bankruptcy, they\u2019ve got bigger on everything that\u2019s going to be challenges or preference, everything that\u2019s going to challenges of fragile and convince. And bear in mind the very large transactions that were done in the year prior to the bankruptcy finally they will have to work through the big pieces of litigation with the yield goes and the failed deals and try to resolve all of that. So as bankruptcies go, there is a lot of big issues that is going to have to dealt with before I think they can get to some of the more - sort of ordinary course of business types. So - and then the impact on the market whether the volumes are going to get builds and whether the utilities are going to re-procure, I simply think that that will play out very slowly over the remainder of 2016. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : Hey, thank you for taking my questions. In terms of Series 5, can you talk about the feedback that you are getting across your customer base as you introduce the Series 5 module? What kind of risks is there for pushback from your customers and do you any contingency plans in place in case you get too much pushback especially in the new form factor? James Alton Hughes : So there\u2019s not been a lot of pushback from customers. There is generally been an enthusiastic response from customers especially in the North American circumstance which is where the economics work the best. There are projects or bidding opportunities out there where we have qualification issues where Series 5 is not been in existence long enough to qualify. That\u2019s not really a challenge for us because we are going to continue to manufacture Series 4 as far into the future is we can see. And we can also adjust the ratio of Series 4 and Series 5 production relatively easily. It\u2019s the same basic production platform with the backend added. So there is a great deal of flexibility in shipping production between Series 4 and Series 5. And as we began to see where the demand is going to be over \u201817, \u201818 and \u201819 and began to see where the adoption of Series 5 is going to be. We\u2019ll be able to tailor sort of the rollout of that and adjust the production of 4 versus 5 fairly easily. So I don\u2019t think we feel like there is whole lot of challenge in those issues. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, actually just a follow-up on that, how long for Series 5 does it need to be kind of in the market place to qualify? And then perhaps the core of the question was you talked about a gigawatt of call it potential projects for \u201817, where and when - I suppose where are those projects principally and when we find out about those opportunities? James Alton Hughes : I\u2019ll let Mark comment on that. On the when does is it qualify; it\u2019s - the rules are different everywhere in the world and even different places within the U.S. and I can\u2019t really generalize any answer. To date, we\u2019ve only come across one circumstance where a customer has an issue - has a problem, so it\u2019s not going to be widespread and not something that we are losing lot of sleepover. Mark Widmar : And then relates to the potential systems bookings, it\u2019s somewhat diverse but mainly concentrated U.S., Japan, India are the main areas that we would make a vast majority of that gigawatt of opportunity. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse Securities. Patrick Jobin : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just two quick follow-up items here, housekeeping items rather. I think in your remarks you said that the asset sale, the restricted asset wasn\u2019t - was included in guidance, are there any other asset sales remainder of \u201816? I guess is the first question. And then the second question is backing into about a $0.50 ASP figure here, I guess that was all modules for bookings in the quarter. Just trying to get a sense of where your cost is, I guess directionally compared to the 28% component margins today, your comfort level of your ability to extract value, your energy density advantage today in module sales, I know it\u2019s a copulated way to ask about extracting value for modules, I am just trying to get a sense relative to that $0.50 ASP? Thanks. James Alton Hughes : So on the asset sales, we included the investment, you know the gain on the sale of the restricted investments as we rebalance the portfolio to again better match the current currencies of investments with the underlying currency of the obligations. So that happened during the quarter and as I indication it\u2019s about $0.20 and that in our guidance for the full year. As it relates to other asset sales, there are not any other items in our guidance at this point in time. Are there any other potential asset sales that could happen during this balance of the year? There is a couple, you know we still have facilities in Europe, in Asia Pacific that we are marketing, you know there is always potential opportunity that something like that could happen but there is no assume benefit of that included in our guidance at this point in time. Look, we are very confident in our ability to extract value from the module and the energy density advantages that we have and we show that in the Analyst Day that advantage will improve overtime. And then with Series 5 and particularly when you normalize for effectively the same form factor as crystalline silicon, there is advantages, we talked about that in terms of labor cost, fewer flips and connectors and those types of things that it will help drive as a cost of that product as it relates to overall cost to install. So we are very comfortable in terms of translating our technology advantage and also normalize in the form factor that that will translate into value. The bookings, yes, the bookings that were reflected in the quarter were primarily modules and there was - it has little inventory that we sold during the quarter that would be below market expectation around value for the module. So there were some of that we sell them. It was around 40 megawatts or so, so that did bring down the average ASP that\u2019s implied by the booking. I would also will tell you is that there is rounding in those numbers so I understand the simply later space of map is going to tell that but there is rounding both ways that won\u2019t get exact same answer. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had three quick ones. First one is the rest of the Desert Stateline about 35% or so that they are going to drop into 8point3, is that all going to happen by in calendar \u201816 as you think it\u2019s into early \u201817? The second one is in terms of the module surprising added modules but you guys that driven by some of the Asian makers, do you worry about any kind of oversupply in the second half of this year as module? Just the final question is Jim, congratulations. And I am curious on the timing of your transition, if you can give us any color any through process behind it why now, any such things that would be very helpful. Thank you. James Alton Hughes : Sure. First on the timing and the transaction, you kwon success it\u2019s something board not have been discussing for quite a while. And this - I would describe this is perhaps slightly accelerates from maybe where we would have thought it was going to be a year ago, but it was clearly a plan that we had in place. We\u2019ve taken some organizational steps to prepare for it, some of which the market was aware of. We are transitioning from one strategic plan that we satisfied and we\u2019re embarking upon a second division 2020 plan. We have a lot of big fundamental decisions, they are good decisions, they are how we are going to best capitalize on our opportunities. And I think the board and I found like that this was the right time to let a new management team colorless around those decisions. So they don\u2019t have - my heavy hand hanging over them and they reflect the views, thoughts and the beliefs of that team because obviously both I and the board want that team to be accountable for meeting the results that are promise. So just for a verity of reasons it felt like the right time, it felt what way to the board, it felt that way to me, Mark was comfortable with it was the right time to transition in terms of a candidate available to fill his role at least on an interim basis. So it\u2019s a verity, it\u2019s a whole verity of reasons and everybody is very, very comfortable with it. Mark Widmar : The other one I think you had on Stateline and you know we still have 34% interest in Stateline. You know the guidance assumes that we drop that down into 8point3 this year. We\u2019ve always said that there is optionality around that and as you noticed in our comments, our prepared comments, we said our current plan is to dropdown Kingbird, Moapa and Stateline to 8point3 but we also give the highlight that was subject to market execution, condition, so you know there could be some issues timing related to that, we have flexibility if we wanted to take Stateline into next year or portion of Stateline if we choose to do that. So that optionality will play itself out subject to many different variables as we progress to the second half of the year. As it relates to over concerns you know we also have kind of healthy dense in concern of what\u2019s going on in the market. And you know we said before the ITC extension that there was a concern around oversupplies as we went into \u201817. You know clearly I think the TIC extension provides a different view of the horizon beyond \u201816, they maybe not have as much resiliency or robustness of demand in \u201817 but currently it drive more demand into \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820 in particular. We are very though encouraged by where the international markets are trending, lot of new opportunities happening internationally, but we are obviously aware of what\u2019s going on in terms of what the additional capacity plans are and the implications relative to support our demand. What I will say as well as we increase the overall competitiveness of our product especially from Series 4 to 5 and then eventually get into the Series 6. We believe we have a very strong technology and a cost advantage technology that whether those types of potential disruptions around supply and demand. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch : Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamics as you move through the middle of the year and then to the back half of the year, you know relative to the kind of clarity that we\u2019re expecting to get out of China in terms of their policy? And talk a little bit the your ability to have pricing power in the market as you move into the higher efficiency range with your products in the back half this year and into next year? James Alton Hughes : I\u2019ll comment a little and then I\u2019ll let Mark add to. The dynamics on pricing vary from markets to markets. And there is some markets where we feel like we have leverage often time that\u2019s tied to specific competitive factors related to the technology or customer relationships, other markets less so. I\u2019d say at this stage with respect to the back half of the year and certainly for the next year, we are still in the mood where we are optimizing sales against margin. In other words we are chasing every opportunity that presents itself. We have the ability to pick and choose the opportunities that were chasing in order to maximize the margin every incremental sales that we achieve. So that is generally indicative of an environment where I wouldn\u2019t say we have pricing power but we have that ability to optimize. So that\u2019s a sign of at least while it\u2019s a reasonable sign of health with respect to the market is how I would describe it. Mark Widmar : Yeah, is only I guess I would add is just it does vary by region and it varies by customer and ultimately what is their overall consumer relationship with particular customer and their understanding of kind of the First Solar value proposition and back ability. So it all does somewhat vary and so you can see different behaviors across the region by customers and what they value. And ultimately if they looked upon and to be long term owner of the asset or they looked upon just be the developer and then sell down the asset. So al that comes into play as we think about how we engage the customer and then ultimately how do we capture the best value for our product now as communicated because we have optionality that plays to our strength, right. So we will target those types of opportunities that we can capture the highest margin entitlement relative to the product and solutions that we provide to the customer. Operator : And we\u2019ll now take our next question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking my question guys. Just one from my end, at the beginning of the year you said that 300 megawatts would be the upper end of dropdowns and it would depend on where CAFD is trading give the yield compression in the stock since the start of the year. Are you comfortable with 300 megawatts as a baseline or is that still you know fairly aggressive target? James Alton Hughes : So we\u2019re continuing to assess and evaluate you know work very closely with SunPower as well as the independent directors of the board of 8point3 understanding kind of current market dynamics the ability to dropdown projects that are accretive for 8point3 as well as provide drive return to First Solar shareholder. We still believe that you know there is a tremendous value at our investment, that\u2019s way to say it to shareholder of 8point3. Clearly there are some market dislocations right now that are impacting that. We believe overtime the investor will better understand quality of these assets, the investor grade off takers, the relatively low variability around the solar assets. The equity will perform overtime. Now whether that completely happens in time for us to dropdown more often Stateline, you know yet to be determined. We\u2019ll evaluate that and we have other options that we choose to pursue that you know similar what we did with Stateline when we sold a portion of Stateline to Southern, so you know we went and then increased the growth by identifying switch which is a large project that will tick COD in 2017 as a potential dropdown to 8point3. So if we made a decision around one of the other assets, you know whether it\u2019s Moapa, Stateline, you know we have more than enough contracted assets that if we chose to we can get replaced and put them into a cadence where some more natural dropdown to 8point3. As we said in the 8point3 area, we already have with the current assets that have been dropdown now with Hooper and we had been completed here recently - excuse me Hopper and [indiscernible] being completed here recently. We have the ability to grow our dividends through the end of \u201817. So we have the luxury of optionality and patience and we\u2019ll evaluate that and see what makes the more sense overtime. Pavel Molchanov : Alright, I appreciate it guys. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - Investor Relations : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2016. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update. Then Alex will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow or non-GAAP earnings per share, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentations for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Before reviewing the results for the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on some key strategic priorities and how I intend to lead the organization in my new role as CEO. In our decision-making, we will continue to apply the same disciplined approach to long-term strategy that has served us extremely well to date. At various times over the past several years, some have questioned our measured approach, the key strategic decisions including capacity expansion, asset ownership and balance sheet utilization. However, we continue to see the benefits of our disciplined strategy and are confident this approach will optimize shareholder value over the long-term. This approach also allows us to be nimble and navigate an industry that is cyclical, high growth and dynamic. The updates I provide today do not constitute any major strategic changes from what we discussed earlier this year at our Analyst Day in April but are further refinements aimed at simplifying and focusing our business. The core of our overall strategy continues to be our differentiated CadTel technology its tremendous potential for further conversion efficiency improvements. Closely aligned to our module efficiency roadmap is the evolution of our module form factor, which as we indicated in April, will begin next year with the introduction of our Series 5 module. Our Series 4 technology is an outstanding product with a superior temperature coefficient, spectral gain and shading response. Series 4 holds an energy density advantage over multi-crystalline silicon products. Series 5 retains the energy density advantage with our CadTel technology, further boost efficiency and is optimized for cost effective installations. To put this into perspective, in a typical market the reduction in Series 5 via less costs relative to Series 4 will be equivalent to boosting module efficiency by approximately 100 basis points. A combination of these factors make this a powerful new product which is supported by cognitive initial feedback from our customers and partners. Given the exciting potential of this product we are not planning to invest in additional efficiency improvements over the next couple of years that will take the Series 5 roadmap to the 390 watt module versus the 365 watt module we introduced at Analyst Day. The competitive position of a Series 5 390 watt module with a similar form factor to crystalline silicon but with the inherent energy advantage of CadTel is very exciting. Moreover, the substantial increase to the Series 5 roadmap has an extremely compelling return on investment. The estimated 60 million of capital expenditures that will be required to enable this efficiency gain across our current 3 gigawatts of production will result in anticipated payback time of less than a year. So focusing on increasing Series 5 efficiency does not change the priority we are placing on Series 6. We continue to push pace of Series 6 development as fast as possible with pilot plant production beginning in 2018. It should be noted that we intend to prioritize long-term investment in the production and development of Series 5 and Series 6 technologies over adding new manufacturing capacity in the short-term. In light of the current supply demand dynamics in the global solar market, we will continue to evaluate the point in time which adding additional capacity makes sense. As we eagerly look forward to these expanding technologies, some strategic realignments are necessary to ensure focused and seamless execution. Firstly, as we recently announced, we have decided to discontinue TetraSun production in order to maximize our Series 5 assembly capabilities at our facility in Malaysia. This not only enables a more rapid roll out of Series 5 product next year, but also allows us to focus more resources and capital on our CadTel roadmap. Secondly, the new Series 5 form factor will significantly broaden the spectrum of third-party structures and tracker technologies, available for use with our modules without requiring First Solar specific components. Previously, the different form factor of our Series 4 technology led us to develop optimized in-house solutions. The new interoperability of Series 5 with the broad global ecosystem of existing third-party structured products is expected to facilitate increased adoption of our module by new customers and increase market opportunities. The evolution of our module form factor allows us to tap into a broader and deeper supply chain for structures and trackers and we have therefore decided to discontinue substantial internal development of fixed-tilt and tracker structures. This decision allows us to refocus resources towards developing closer relationships with industry-leading structure and tracker technology providers and at the same time eliminate some of the channel conflicts that existed in certain situations today. Thirdly, the progression of the interoperability of our modules also impacts our strategy as it relates to EPC capabilities. Historically, we have self-performed EPC on the majority of our systems projects as well as provided EPC services to third-party developers using First Solar module technology. The evolution of our module form factor combined with the lower line of system projects in 2017 implies a reduced need for internal EPC services and requires a reduction in our EPC workforce. While these decisions are difficult and will impact a number of dedicated associates, this is a necessary step. We will continue to maintain sufficient internal EPC resources to support the construction of our self developed projects. This allows us to continue to provide comprehensive solutions to our customers and also enables continued development of next-generation BOS technologies such as MVDC which we introduced at our Analyst Day. It should be clear that this decision around EPC in no way impacts our project development business and in fact allows us to allocate more capital and focus more resources on this critical aspect of our business model. Lastly, as part of our refocusing efforts, we have also decided to explore options for the disposition of skytron energy. Our original intent in acquiring skytron was to expand our global O&M footprint into Europe and supplement our existing capabilities. Over the past two years competition for O&M contracts in Europe, combined with the progression of First Solar's internal O&M capability, particularly as it relates to smaller scale solar plants, has changed how skytron fits into our strategy going forward. Altogether we expect charges of $105 million to $120 million related to TetraSun and the actions we are announcing today. On an annual basis going forward, the total reductions in operating expense and cost of sales is expected to be $60 million to $80 million. Alex will provide more detail on these charges and associated savings. While these decisions are difficult for part of our organization, these actions will best position First Solar to increase its competitive position over the next several years. We're excited about the potential of our Series 5 and Series 6 technologies and are well positioned with the resources and capabilities necessary to execute on our plans. With that, let's turn to our results. Our financial results for the quarter were strong with net sales of over $930 million and non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, of $0.87. These results were underpinned by continuing execution across both our module manufacturing and system project portfolio. Our module lead line efficiency is currently running at 16.7%, and we continue to lower our cost per watt. We completed our Silver State South and McCoy projects in Q2 and are nearing completion of the Stateline project. We recognized significance cost savings on these projects in the quarter as a result of our outstanding execution. Alex will discuss the financial results for the quarter in more detail. Moving on to slide five, I'll provide an update on our latest bookings activities. In the second quarter, we shipped close to 715 megawatts of modules, bringing our year-to-date total as of June 30 to 1.6 gigawatts. Against these shipments, we have booked approximately 1.4 gigawatts year-to-date including the period up to today's call. I'll now provide some more details on the approximately 800 megawatts of bookings since our last earnings call. In the U.S. we have signed PPAs for two projects totaling over 180 megawatts DC with a leading Western utility. These projects have CODs in 2019 and 2020, which now brings our total projects with executed PPAs with CODs in 2019 or later to over 1.2 gigawatts DC, which are ideally suited for the competitively advantaged Series 5, Series 6, and MVDC. As evidenced by these bookings, we continue to see many encouraging signs for solar demand over the long-term horizon. Beyond these project bookings we continue to have active discussions with both utilities and C&I customers seeking large-scale solar power supply. The interest from C&I customers is particularly strong, with these customers typically looking for renewables to meet up to 100% of their energy supply needs. We see this opportunity as a key market focus and have a dedicated team specifically working with these customers to provide comprehensive solutions that meet their needs. In the U.S. we are also encouraged by the increasing demand for Community Solar solutions; a market segment that we continue to view as having tremendous potential to meet residential and commercial customers' needs at a dramatically lower cost than rooftop solar. Underscoring the growth potential for Community Solar, a third-party research firm recently estimated that Community Solar's addressable market is more than seven times as large as rooftop solar. Thus far in 2016 we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of volume that will supply more than 25 different community solar projects across multiple states. Majority of this volume is with a single customer where we continue to see opportunities to collaborate on future Community Solar projects. An initial 41-megawatt project is underway with M+W as the EPC contractor. To put the 120 megawatts of bookings in perspective, once this volume has been installed, it will effectively double the amount of cumulative Community Solar installations in the U.S. We are pleased with the recent progress and continue to work with various customers to capture the growing Community Solar opportunity in the U.S. Elsewhere in the United States, we booked module supply agreements for over 80 megawatts DC in diverse solar markets such as Idaho and North Carolina. Internationally, we have bookings in India. They have been strong with over 280 megawatts DC of new bookings. The volume booked was a combination of both module supply agreements and 16-megawatt AC of PPAs. These latest PPAs bring our current development pipeline in India to 260 megawatts AC. Altogether we have booked approximately 250 megawatts DC of systems project this quarter, with approximately one-third of the volumes scheduled for 2017 deliveries. Relative to our expectations for the 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017, we have approximately 400 megawatts DC of contracted projects with additional projects added. We have visibility to a number of additional potential booking opportunities that we continue to pursue towards the 1 gigawatt total. As we bid on future PPAs, we will continue to maintain our discipline and leverage our strengths in bidding opportunities. In situations where we engage early in the process with key partners and leverage the strength of our new Series 5 technologies into the offering, we feel that we are extremely competitive. In addition to the 800 megawatts of bookings in the past quarter, we have also been awarded opportunities of over 410 megawatts DC, which we expect to convert into bookings during the remainder of this year. Firstly in Zambia along with our partner Neoen, we were awarded 53 megawatts DC power plant, which is expected to deliver the lowest cost solar electricity in sub-Sahara Africa. The energy density advantages of our CadTel module is particularly strong in this type of hot and humid climate, allows us to provide extremely competitive solar solutions. The remaining awarded volume of approximately 357 megawatts DC pertains to module supply agreements in France, Israel, India and Thailand. In France, we were pleased with the results of the most recent tender process where we awarded over 100 megawatts of volume. As these awarded projects are converted into bookings, we will discuss them in more detail on future earnings calls. Moving on to slide six, our bookings and expected revenue term stands at $6 billion, a decrease of $900 million from the end of last year. The decrease in expected revenue is the result of the higher mix of module-only business booked as compared to a higher mix of system revenue recognized year-to-date. In addition it is also driven by lower ASPs associated with some of the longer dated PPAs included in our bookings. While ASPs on these longer-dated PPAs are naturally lower than on a project we are currently constructing, there is still an expectation of attractive margins on these projects given our efficiency and cost roadmaps discussed at our Analyst Day earlier this year. Slide seven provides an update of potential bookings opportunities which has grown to 24 megawatts DC, an increase of approximately 700 megawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid to late stage booking opportunities are 1.8 gigawatts with international opportunities again comprising close to 90% of this number. Note that over 400 megawatts of awarded but not booked volume discussed earlier in this presentation is included in this 1.8 gigawatts. Also it is important to note, as the number of third-party module sales opportunities and our potential bookings number has increased over time, we are beginning to see an increase in the velocity at which these projects can move from early stage opportunities to confirmed bookings. For instance, more than half of our bookings during the past quarter were an early stage opportunity at the time of our Q1 call. Turning to slide eight, while North America remains our largest geography at over 40% of the total, we continue to have a diversified geographic mix of potential booking opportunities. The largest regional increases since the last call were in the United States and India, where we saw significant growth in opportunities from the prior quarter. We're encouraged by the expanding pipeline in both of these regions, given our historical win rate, reflective of our energy density and the mix of system and module sales. One last point to keep in mind is the timing of bookings can be very uneven. For example, in the first six months of the year, our bookings total was only 800 megawatts; however, in the past month alone we have added close to 600 megawatts. We continue to aggressively pursue new opportunities while working diligently to close those projects nearing the finish line, including the over 400 megawatts DC (16:54) awarded volume previously mentioned, but the timing of when this occurs can be lumpy. I'll now turn it over to Alex, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016. Alexander R. Bradley - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Mark and good afternoon. I'll begin with some highlights of our operational performance during the past quarter. In Q2 we produced 785 megawatts DC or an increase of 1% from the prior quarter, resulting from higher module efficiencies and increased throughput. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, production was 39% higher as a result of higher efficiencies, improved throughput, and the addition of new capacity. Our factory capacity utilization was unchanged at 100% in Q2 versus the prior quarter, but increased by 15 percentage points versus the same period in 2015. The higher year-over-year capacity utilization was due to fewer efficiency upgrade activities in Q2 as we focused on maximizing output to meet demand in the first half of the year. The fleet average module conversion efficiency in Q2 was 16.2%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter but increased 80 basis points year-over-year. Our best line conversion efficiency was also unchanged from Q1 at 16.4%, but increased by 20 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2015. Most recently, our lead line has been running at 16.7% efficiency and we're encouraged by our progress towards our target of 17% lead line efficiency at the end of the year. Turning to slide 11, I'll discuss the P&L results for the second quarter. Net sales of $934 million for the quarter compared to $848 million in Q1. The sales increase resulted from higher third-party module sales, the sale of our Kingbird project, and higher revenue recognition across various systems projects. Partially offsetting the higher sales was lower revenue recognized on our Silver State South and Stateline projects which reached or neared completion in Q2. The higher module sales were driven by shipments to projects in Dubai and the Southeastern U.S. In relation to our Kingbird project, it should be noted that this project sale was structured with a tax equity partner with the residual cash interest sold to 8point3 Energy Partners, which resulted in a different accounting treatment as compared to our historical project sales. As a result of the transaction structure, whereby First Solar provides an indemnity relating to the tax equity structuring, only a portion of the revenue from the transaction was recognized and the entire profit of $20 million has been deferred on the balance sheet. If we'd have been able to recognize the entire transaction in Q2, our gross margin would have improved by approximately 80 basis points and earnings per share would have increased by approximately $0.16. It's important to keep in mind that the underlying economic substance of the transaction was very favorable; though under current real estate accounting it is not reflected in the current period results. Also, note that all cash relating to the project sale, both from tax equity and 8point3 was received. Continuing on, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 83% from 93% in the prior quarter, as a result of the higher mix of module-only sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 20%, compared to 31% in the first quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. As a reminder, in Q1 we sold an additional interest in the Stateline project, leading to a significantly higher mix of revenue from development projects in Q1. Q2 gross margin was also impacted by an $8.5 million charge associated with the write-down of TetraSun inventory. Adjusted for this item, second quarter gross margin would have improved by approximately 90 basis points. Our component segment gross margin decreased slightly to 24% in the second quarter, compared to 29% in Q1. The decrease was primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, partially offset by a decrease in our module cost per watt. We're very encouraged by our progress in reducing our module cost per watt through efficiency improvements, increased throughput, and bill of material reductions. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges were $97 million in Q2, a decrease of $1 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to lower employee related costs, partially offset by higher R&D expenses for development of our Series 5 technology. Restructuring and asset impairment charges totaled $86 million in the quarter, primarily related to TetraSun. As indicated in our recent press release, we anticipate total charges of up to $100 million, substantially all of which is expected to be non-cash. We expect operating expense savings of $2 million to $4 million this year and $8 million to $10 million on an annual basis going forward. Operating income was $9 million for the second quarter or $94 million adjusted for restructuring. Prior quarter operating income was $165 million. Other income was $7 million in the second quarter compared to $36 million in Q1. The current quarter income was primarily related to a reversal of outstanding contingent consideration associated with the TetraSun acquisition. Other income in the prior quarter was primarily due to a $38 million gain from the sale and rebalancing of certain restricted investments associated with our module end-of-life program. Tax expense for Q2 was $9 million and the effective tax rate was unusually high due to the impact of restructuring. Adjusted for the restructuring and asset impairment charges, the tax rate for the quarter would have been more in line with the full year guidance tax range. Also, note that while not in our Q2 results, during July we received a favorable ruling from a foreign tax authority which will result in a tax benefit of $35 million in our Q3 results. Q2 earnings were $0.13 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $0.87 on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to earnings of $1.66 in the prior quarter. The non-GAAP EPS does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. Non- recurring charges aside, which were primarily from TetraSun, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance and we're pleased with our progress through the first half of the year. Continuing on slide 12, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities decreased $213 million to an ending balance of $1.7 billion. Our net cash position also decreased to $1.4 billion. Cash decrease from the prior quarter due to ongoing construction of projects on balance sheet, capital expenditures, and debt repayment. For the quarter, net working capital including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, was virtually unchanged. The decrease in project related assets due to the sale of Kingbird and the reclassification of certain projects in Chile and India to PV solar power systems was largely offset by an increase in unbilled AR. The Luz del Norte project was reclassified as it has been placed in service and we anticipate holding the asset for several years pending transmission upgrades in Chile. The increase in unbilled AR is expected to decline in Q3 as billing milestones are reached. Total debt decreased $66 million from the prior quarter to $233 million, primarily due to the $70 million repayment of the remaining balance on our Malaysia debt facilities. The remaining debts outstanding is comprised of $163 million of limited or non-recourse project-level debt and $70 million of recourse project-level debt, the majority of which is a short-term VAT loan associated with our Luz del Norte asset. Cash flows used in operations of $75 million compared to cash flows from operations of $50 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow was negative $140 million compared to positive free cash flow of $13 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $78 million as compared to $52 million in the prior quarter, as we increased investments in our Series 5 technology. Depreciation for the quarter was $53 million or approximately $2 million lower than the prior quarter. Before turning to our updated guidance for the year, we've summarized on slide 13 the expected impact of restructuring charges and the associated future benefits from these actions. Firstly, as indicated, the total expected charges associated with both the TetraSun and other restructuring announcements is between $105 million and $120 million, the majority of which is non-cash. Of the $90 million to $100 million of TetraSun charges, we incurred approximately $86 million in Q2 with the remainder expected to be incurred in the second half of 2016. The charges associated with our EPC and skytron restructuring are expected to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million and are expected to occur primarily in the third and fourth quarters. Going forward we expect total annual savings related to these actions of $60 million to $80 million, of which $55 million to $65 million are cash savings. Annualized OpEx savings associated with these actions are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Note that due to the timing of the restructuring, we expect limited OpEx savings in 2016. Turning to slide 14, I'll now discuss the updates to our full year 2016 guidance. Overall, the changes to our full year non-GAAP guidance, which excludes restructuring, are relatively minor. While the first half of the year results have been strong, we continue to take a measured approach to guidance for the time being given uncertainties in the second half of the year. In particular, we anticipate closing the sales of our Moapa asset, our California Flats asset, and our remaining 34% interest in the Stateline asset. As we progress further into the third quarter, we'll have greater visibility into these various project sale dynamics. Relative to Stateline, our guidance assumption continues to anticipate dropping our remaining 34% interest in the project to 8point3, subject to market conditions. To the extent that we do sell all 34% of our interest in 2016, this would likely result in earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. We will also continue to evaluate the potential to sell a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline in 2017, dependent upon developments in our own business during the second half of the year, as well as based on market conditions relating to 8point3. Turning to our guidance ranges, our net sales forecast is unchanged at $3.8 billion to $4 billion. We're bringing up the low end of our gross margin guidance to a revised range of 18.5% to 19%, compared to the prior range of 18% to 19%. This update is a result of the significant project cost savings achieved in the second quarter. Note that as previously discussed, the net sales range and gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Our GAAP operating expenses are projected in the range of $485 million to $520 million for the year. This includes the $105 million to $120 million of restructuring associated charges. Our non-GAAP operating expense guidance, excluding those restructuring and asset impairment charges is unchanged at $380 million to $400 million. We're leaving the range unchanged as 2016 OpEx reductions are expected to be limited given the timing of the announced restructuring, and are offset by earlier than planned production startup expenses from the Series 5 acceleration and from incremental R&D for Series 6. Improvement in the gross margin has been flowing through to the low end of our non-GAAP operating income guidance, which has been raised to $310 million. The non-GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16% to 18%. This projected tax range excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned previously. Moving on to EPS guidance, on a GAAP basis we expect earnings in the range of $3.65 to $3.90. Excluding restructuring charges, the low end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance is ranged to $4.20, with the upper bound unchanged at $4.50. The impact to EPS from the expected sale of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings remains unchanged at approximately $145 million net of tax. Additionally, approximately $0.20 of other income net of tax is included in the earnings guidance range from the previously discussed Q1 sale of the restricted investments. Also, keep in mind that the EPS guidance does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. The distribution of earnings for the remainder of the year is anticipated to be slightly more weighted towards the fourth quarter due to the timing of expected project sales. Operating cash flow has been reduced to $500 million to $650 million from the prior range of $500 million to $700 million, reflecting the expected impact of cash restructuring charges. Again, the operating cash flow range does not include approximately $320 million from the expected sale of the remaining interest in Stateline, which we expect to treat as an investing cash flow. Our capital expenditures guidance has been revised to a range of $275 million to $325 million from the previous range of $300 million to $400 million, reflecting a change in timing of expected spend. The adjustment to timing has no impact on our planned efficiency roadmap and Series 5 product launch. The net result of these changes leaves our net cash balance guidance unchanged at $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. Turning to slide 15, I'll now summarize our progress during the past quarter. Firstly, our financial results for the second quarter were strong with a revenue of $934 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.87. We updated our 2016 non-GAAP earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.50. Our technology performance is progressing towards the goals we outlined in our April Analyst Day, with the best line efficiency currently running at 16.7%. And our year-to-date bookings are now 1.4 gigawatts with other 800 megawatts booked since our last earnings call. The number of potential bookings opportunities continues to grow and is now over 24 gigawatts. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Stephen Haymore - Investor Relations : One thing I guess before we do that. Apparently there was a technical issue I think on the webcast, that the individuals who were logged in on the webcast I think did not get the first part of the prepared remarks. There will be obviously as always a link on our website that you can hear the replay; and that replay would be available later today for any of those on the webcast who were unfortunately unable to catch the first portion of today's prepared remarks, okay. With that, operator, we'll open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, can you maybe talk about the profitability of the bookings that you're seeing right now, especially in markets like India? And can you just talk about how we should think about capacity, especially as you get into 2017? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I guess just general color around the profitability on bookings. We're still very pleased with the margin realization that we're capturing. We are being very disciplined though and engaging in making sure that we're capturing full value of our technology. So if you use India as an example, it's a market that our technology is competitively advantaged. A hot humid climate, we have a superior spectral response and that can command an energy advantage over crystalline silicon. Plus it's mainly fixed tilt structures in India, which is again more advantage for our Series 4 product than, say, a tracker solution. Plus we have a number of self-developed projects in India, and the returns on what we're capturing against the sell-down \u2013 our anticipated sell-down of those projects are in line with what we would normally expect and even in some cases on the upper end of our expectation. We've been very pleased with the ultimate performance of those assets. Having said that, is the market becoming more competitive? It clearly is. We're seeing a lot of very aggressive pricing behavior in the market whether it's at the PPA level or whether it's at the module level. And that's why we have to be disciplined and selective, and engaging with customers and developing relationships to ensure we can capture the full value of the offers and the value creation that we provide to our partners and our customers. So we are being disciplined in that regard and we are seeing a very aggressive marketing environment. There's no doubt about that. And that's what's also informed our view around capacity expansion and why we are being disciplined as we think about when we'll add capacity. As we indicated in our prepared remarks that we'll continue to assess that as we move forward. As it relates to near-term, our focus is converting all of our capacity into Series 5. So we want all of our Series 4 product into Series 5 as quickly as possible, and our current timeline would indicate that that would happen in the end of 2017. We'll continue then also to validate the business case around Series 6. And as we get more informed and have a better understanding and realization of the current views around Series 6, we will start to think about how do we add capacity and the associated timing around that. So I would say for now, again, near-term focus, moving Series 4 to Series 5; as we get better information and validate Series 6, that'll determine the timing around when do we start to add incremental capacity. Operator : And the next question comes from Ben Kallo with Robert Baird. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got two. First of all, when you guys talk about your margin, I guess at Analyst Day, your target margin, and maybe this loops onto Vishal's question and there're lot of concerns out there in the marketplace. As we look to next year, is that a valid range for us to think about as of this year and what you guys have talked about as your target margin? I guess as you look at projects like Moapa which you can move around a little bit, what type \u2013 and I think you guys already said that you're at the high end of your guidance if everything goes okay. So it seems like there's some flexibility into next year as well. So how do you guys think about that, about 2017, and being able to move projects into that if you don't need to finish them this year, as well as the margin question? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : I'll do the margin question. I'll let Alex take the question around how we're thinking through timing of activities between 2017 and 2016. As it relates to the margin realization, similar to what we, I think, highlighted in the Analyst Day, especially when you start looking at our contracted pipeline in particular, the margin profile will start on the lower end of the range in 2017 and then continue to improve as we move through the balance of this decade primarily because as we transition into Series 5, it's a much more competitive product. And what we look at right now for our Series 5 capacity in 2017, it's probably going to be right around 1 gigawatt, which means we have about 2 gigawatts of Series 4 product that we're going to have to sell through. We also indicated in the comments today that the value of that delta in form factor as it relates to lower labor cost, fewer connectors, better wire management, elimination of clips is worth over 100 basis points of equivalent efficiency. So what you should think about is our margin profile in 2017 is going to be on the lower end. It's mainly because two-thirds of our production volume is still going to be Series 4. As we transition that into Series 5 and then really get to a position of an equivalent form factor and really capturing full value of our energy advantages, you'll see margin expansion as we go into 2018 and 2019 and 2020. Alexander R. Bradley - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Talking about the projects, so it really relates to our Cal Flats, Moapa, and then our residual interest in the Stateline asset. We'd expect to complete the sale of the Cal Flats asset in either late Q3 or early Q4, and then Moapa in Q4 of this year. We've guided to selling our remaining 34% interest in Stateline this year and that's still in our base case. I'd say along with both Moapa and Cal Flats, there's still significant uncertainty around the structure and the ultimate value of those sales. So in terms of our guidance, we're remaining conservative as we continue to develop those structures. The Stateline sale is really dependent on the other two deals as well as market conditions relating to the yield curve. So we'll make that decision in Q3 or Q4. We do have the flexibility with Stateline to push some of that into 2017 if needed. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I had two. So first off, last quarter, Mark, you mentioned roughly 950 megawatts of potential systems bookings as you move through the back half of the year. I think you had mentioned those were international. Can you update us on if that pipeline is still intact, or how much has already been booked and vice versa how much maybe has come off? And then the second question just on some specific projects. On Stateline, if you can update us on how much revenue is left to be recognized and what percent of the project has been completed. And then separately, I know you alluded to this, but on Moapa it sounds like the expectation is that you do sell the project in its entirety this year in Q4, but are you exploring different options of monetization similar to what you've done with Stateline now that you've taken it off the 8point3 ROFO list? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : So relative to the contracted or systems business pipeline for 2017, one of the things we said in our prepared remarks \u2013 with our incremental booking that we now have, India which is a little less than 100 megawatts DC. We have about 400 megawatts of systems business already positioned for 2017. We have a pipeline that would move us towards closing that out and getting to a gigawatt expectation for 2017, for that other 600 megawatts or so. We're still working through those. There are a couple in there that I would say that \u2013 not around the economics. Those economics are very compelling. There're some issues around structuring of the PPAs and overall bankability of those PPAs. As you know, as we indicated already some of these are in international markets where we're just trying to work through in making sure they're clearly financeable and bankable. So there're some challenges in that regard, but what I would say is there's a sufficient pipeline of projects that would enable us to get to our goal of having 1 gigawatt of systems business in 2017. The other aspect that we continue to be very mindful of and very disciplined on is making sure that we get a proper return on capital, given the risk profile of doing international development business, right. In some markets pricing has gotten very aggressive, so we have to be careful in that regard. So we'll be balanced, making sure that the return on capital is commensurate with the underlying risk associated with those opportunities, but I would say in aggregate, we're still very happy with the robustness of our pipeline to get to our goal next year of 1 gigawatt of systems business. On the Stateline discussion, I'll take that one and I'll let Alex take the question on Moapa. When you get the Q, which will be available tomorrow to see, I think, I'll say effectively 96% or somewhere in the upper-90%s Stateline has been completed through the second quarter. So the vast majority of the revenue that was related to the sale for Southern has now been recognized through Q2. We have about 4% of that left and the project will achieve COD in the third quarter. Alexander R. Bradley - Chief Financial Officer : With relation to Moapa, yes. So it's no longer on the ROFO list for 8point3. That gives us a lot more flexibility in the structuring. I'd say that we're still in early stages, so we're not going to go into the detail of the structure now but we would expect to monetize the entire asset in Q4 of this year. Operator : And the next question will come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Mark, in the prepared remarks you talked of how the expected revenue per expected module of shipment is coming down a little bit, owing to the shift towards longer dated PPAs. Is that a trend? And is it a trend that in any way relates to your customer's awareness of your product transition? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : I mean, like clearly it's a trend. PPA prices are coming down; you can see that each and every day when somebody else announces a new PPA price, wherever that may be around the world. PPA prices have become pretty competitive in a number of markets. Some of those \u2013 I would argue in some cases, it's questionable whether or not they're going to be viable or able to be achieved, but there's a pretty long runway to delivering against some of those assets that go out into the 2019, 2020 timeframe or potentially even later than that. So clearly PPA prices have come down. I don't know if it's directly related to \u2013 I wouldn't sort of position this being directly related to our advantages and our advancements and our roadmap and our form factor and efficiency. The other day we're competing against crystalline silicon, so it's really relative to the alternative technology that's in the marketplace. And so to the extent that we create separation relative to crystalline silicon, that value should accrete back to First Solar. I would also say that there's a very strong bias in the marketplace for more and more customers and developers and partners coming to First Solar first. We've got a number of parties who historically over the years have moved away from First Solar that are coming back to First Solar. And we've also got a number of other partners that are starting to come to discussions with First Solar that we historically have never had conversations with. And I do think that is related to our roadmap and our technology, and understanding where First Solar is going to go long-term with our capabilities, not only on the module side but as we indicated before, with MVDC and the advantages that that creates for the balance of system cost and just general learnings around BOS and optimization and wire management and a lot of things that we're doing to drive down a lot of cost. We're getting more and more interest from other parties to want to do more business with First Solar. So clearly trended a lower PPA, but not to extent that when I look at where the PPA pricing is going that I'm concerned relative to what we can personally do with our overall cost-reduction roadmap. Just as a relevant data point, just on the module alone, year-on-year our reduction on our module cost has been in the mid to upper-teens. So in the last 12 months, we've taken mid to upper-teen type of cost out of our module which is extremely impactful and competitive and it ultimately creates an opportunity to have robust margins against the contracted pipeline that we've created. Operator : And moving on to Phil Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I think you've touched on this in part already, but I wanted to ask a more pointed question. Module ASPs globally are falling sharply on overcapacity issues. The acceleration to the downside really started at the beginning of July. How is this impacting your module-only and module-plus business? And how do you expect to respond to this downside price move? You talked about moving up the capacity roll-out of Series 5; could we start to see some meaningful volumes of the Series 5 module? And if so, can you quantify what that might be in 2017? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : Like I mentioned previously, Phil, our volume right now for Series 5 in 2017 will be about 1 gigawatt. So about a third of our production will be Series 5. So there still will be a meaningful amount of Series 4 product that we obviously will have to sell through into next year. Some of that is already contracted, but there is more volume that we have to make sure that we sell through in that regard. You're right, module pricing has become more competitive. We are still able to command a premium for our technology. That's why we try to focus on markets where we're more significantly advanced. We even referenced in our prepared remarks, Zambia, right? So there was a opportunity in Zambia for over 50 megawatts. It's a hot, humid climate, which is an advantage for our technology. So what we are doing globally is looking at pockets of strength. We're trying to manage with constraining ourself on available capacity, at least at this point in time, especially as it relates to Series 4. We're looking for pockets of strength where we can sell through and capture highest-margin opportunity entitlement that we have relative to what's going on in the marketplace, but we're very well aware of how aggressive some of the pricing has become. Alexander R. Bradley - Chief Financial Officer : Phil, I'd also say that not every customer does see the value, but there are clearly some that differentiate and some see the value in our balance sheet, our performance. It depends a lot on the buyer. So if you're selling to developers who are looking to flip assets, they may not value the full entitlement of the module, and they may not be the sellers that we choose to sell to. While we are capacity constrained, as Mark said, that allows us to pick and choose those buyers all the more and look for those long-term owners that will fully value the benefits of the module. Operator : And this question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask just a couple quick questions. Maybe to first start-off following up with the last, can you comment a bit on the duration of the cycle that we're looking at? What inning do you think we are, to use the analogy, in terms of the inventory cycle and the build out of the supply? And then perhaps secondly, going back to the 2017 discussion on margins, can you elaborate a little bit as you ramp up from that 400 megawatts of development systems to that 1 gig, when you think about margins and being at the lower end of that range, is that specific to the development \u2013 inclusive of that 1 gigawatt playing out? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : So, I don't know. We always get that question. What inning are we in? I don't know. I mean look, this industry is so dynamic and can change so quickly, to be able to articulate and have a well-thought out view of what the inning is, is difficult because it can change. The game seems like it can change very quickly and events can happen very quickly that becomes disruptive or undermine or events can happen that become very positive. And clearly there is, on the positive side, there's a clear understanding globally of kind of the demand elasticity around solar and the competitiveness of solar in many different markets. And that's driving a demand profile that obviously is very encouraging. There's also \u2013 the offsetting side of that is there's quite a bit of capacity that is being added or planned to be added, maybe is a better way to say that, but that can change very quickly as well. I mean, as people think about the market opportunities and what they're willing to sell through and what ultimately is sustainable, the planned announcements that have been communicated may or may not happen. I mean there's still a lot of uncertainty as to whether or not that production supply comes to market or not. So I don't want to get into an analogy of an inning because I think it's very, very difficult from that standpoint. Alexander R. Bradley - Chief Financial Officer : On the margin piece I'd say 2017 is still pretty uncertain. So we'll have more clarity at the end of the year when we hold the guidance call. What I would say though is that we always knew that 2017 would be a challenging year, especially as we saw margins decline from our more lucrative legacy contracts as they rolled off. The ITC extension in 2016 came too late to influence 2017. That's why we think it's incredibly important that we see both a transition towards higher module business in 2017 but also as a product from Series 4 to Series 5. The other thing I'd refer you back to is the Analyst Day when we talked about what our long-term contracted pipeline looks like. Back then we spoke about having over 2.5 gigawatts of contracted assets after 2017, with north of $1 billion of contracted margin entitlement. I think if you look at that, combine that with \u2013 even without capacity expansion another 7 or so gigawatts of modules for sale, I would expect some of that volume to be incremental systems as well as modules. When you combine that with executing on the cost reduction roadmap and our OpEx coming down, I think we look to see beyond 2017 having acceptable and robust margins across the new products. 2017 itself is somewhat opaque today and we'll give better guidance around that towards the end of the year. Operator : And the next question comes from Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have three of them here. First, on 2017 are you still comfortable with the 1 gigawatt system business? I guess this morning Dominion came out and doubled their outlook for solar in 2017, and Georgia Power clearly with their 1.6 gigawatt business. I guess I'm trying to understand your comfort level on the 1 gigawatt, if that's increased or decreased relative to your Q1 view. That's the first question. Second question, can you just flush out maybe that low end of margin guidance? There was a few ranges at the Analyst Day; I'm curious. Third point, the component gross margins of 24% \u2013 I guess more of an accounting question \u2013 but is that driven by spot market pricing or the pricing locked-in during contracting? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so, on the 1 gigawatt for 2017, we're 400 megawatts in right now. If you asked me the other 600 megawatts, there's \u2013 really high confidence on 300 megawatts of the 600 megawatts. The other 300 megawatts I would say there's still a number of moving pieces. And some of the announcements that have come out here recently and now people are thinking about, especially in the U.S., opportunity to procure in 2017 that gets me more encouraging. As I look at some of these international opportunities and especially the challenge in some cases to some of the PPAs, as I indicated, to get them to be financeable \u2013 that sort of sways me the other way. But I would say on balance, we feel that we will get to with \u2013 whether it's 850 megawatts or 900 megawatts, it's going to be within a ZIP Code that's going to be close to that 1 gigawatt of volume at least for next year. So, I'd say there's reasonable level of comfort from that standpoint. On the margin guidance, I think the best way to handle, as Alex already said, is that we're not going to get into the specifics of that right now. There're so many moving pieces that we would rather wait until we do our guidance call in December. What I would also continue to point you to is that whatever that view is, and when we communicate that in December, I don't think we should look at this as a discrete data point as indicative of the long-term earnings potential of First Solar. The 2017 margin profile, especially as we indicated with Series 4 still being the predominant product in our platform, it's going to drive a little bit of margin pressure. There's no doubt about that. But that is a temporary issue that corrects itself in the second half of 2017 and then it is completely fixed by the end of 2017, where we got a form factor that's consistent crystalline silicon and driving towards a 390-watt panel with all of the energy advantages that we've talked about around CadTel. So, when we look at it through that horizon, we feel very, very confident about where we're going with our technology and ultimately the competitiveness of our products. Around the component gross margin, there's an element of its spot and it's also the \u2013 it's an indication of contracted volume. So it's a combination of the two. As we indicated this quarter, as an example, over half of our bookings that we recorded of our 800 megawatts or so, were not in our late stage development pipeline which means that those were transactions since the last earnings call that we've gone out and we've negotiated around pricing in a very short period of time, and then closed those orders. And a high percentage of that volume will ship this year and those margins that will be realized against those shipments will be in line with what we're currently reflecting in our components segment today. And as I also indicated, if you just look at our module cost delta year-on-year, we've seen high-teen \u2013 upper-teen cost reduction on our module just in the last 12 months. And the team continues to make tremendous progress on that side of the house. So we're able to as best we can sort of manage that price/cost battle, but we also do it in a way that we're trying to be selective of where we're selling through and to make sure we're targeting markets that we get the highest value for our products. Operator : And moving on to Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of them. One is, Mark, I understand you're not giving next year guidance, but I'm just trying to think, is the thought process right that when you move to Series 5 capacity more next year and you decide to add more capacity, your cash balance should come down exiting 2017? And then the second question I had was, of your total shipments in Q2 or of the booking opportunity that you have, how much of that booking opportunity is modules-only? And of the total shipments in Q2, how much is direct versus indirect module? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : So on the Series 5 comment and impact to cash balance, one thing I think you also ought to think about around Series 5 is it's really relatively CapEx-light, relative to \u2013 if we had to start a new greenfield, all we're taking is our existing platform and we're converting it into a different product that is optimized around lot of management and some other things along those lines. And so it's not really a significant CapEx. We're going to finish this year somewhere around $2 billion of cash as we exit the year. Series 5 in and of itself is not going to drive a significant delta to that number, as we deploy that capacity or conversion of the product \u2013 Series 4 into Series 5 product in 2017. I'm not sure I got your last question. Can you repeat your last question? Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I was trying to find out of your total shipment of modules, how much is direct versus indirect in Q2? And of the 24-plus gigawatt booking opportunity, how much is modules? Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : So when you say shipments in Q2, are you talking bookings in Q2 or true shipments? Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : True shipments. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. What we disclosed in that regard is that a little bit more than 80% of the shipments or the revenue I guess is a better way to say it in Q2 was systems and the balance was modules. So I don't know if that gets to your question in that regard. In terms of the 24 gigawatts and the breakout between systems and modules, we don't really provide that level of detail, but I think you clearly can anticipate that that profile and that mix of systems versus module is increasing. So there will be a higher percentage of module sales reflected in that pipeline than would have had historically. Mark R. Widmar - Chief Executive Officer : I think that's our last question. The other thing I'd just like to remind everyone on is, again, apologize for the issues on the webcast. There will be a replay available on the First Solar Investor Relations portion of our website and that should be available later today. We thank everyone for their time. Operator : Well thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today.",

Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar's Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its financial results for the third quarter of 2016. A copy of the press release and the presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update. Then Alex will discuss our third quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2016. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures and the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of the presentation. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We had another good quarter of financial results in Q3 with net sales of $688 million and an earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges and a foreign tax benefit of $1.22. We continue to push forward on our technology roadmap with our best line efficiency exiting the third quarter, almost touching 17% at 16.9% efficiency. Our project execution was also strong as we continued construction on multiple utility-scale solar projects and continue to realize significant BoS savings. Despite the results of the past quarter, the rapidly evolving market pricing environment as shown on slide four, presents significant challenges to the upcoming year. While we will not be discussing our 2017 outlook on today's call, it is important to understand the dramatic pricing declines in the industry is currently experiencing and how we intend to respond. As we highlighted on our Q2 earnings call, we saw the module and PPA pricing environment at that time as increasingly aggressive and challenging. However, the impact of the lower second half 2016 installs in China were only just becoming evident. And the week since that call we have seen other module manufacturers continuing to bring online new capacity in the phase of the demand drop off in China. As a result of the oversupply and growing inventories, module pricing has declined at a dramatic rate in the third quarter. Since quarter end, there has been some signs of potential stabilization, as wafer and cell spot prices first leveled off, then increased slightly. In addition, module ASPs has leveled off perhaps finding a near-term floor as manufacturers clear inventory. As we said consistently and reiterated on our Q1 2016 earnings call, when an oversupply situation exists, our strategy is to take a disciplined approach to the market. This means that we may walk away from module supply opportunity if the economics do not make sense for us. During the past quarter, challenging pricing conditions dictated that in certain situations we needed to apply this strategy, which has impacted our near-term bookings, but we continue to view this strategy as the most sensible long-term approach. In these types of oversupply situations, we also will look very closely at our module manufacturing capacity. Our goal is not to push supply into a saturated and margin challenged market, but rather to balance production to meet demand. As a result of this strategy and current market conditions, we have begun the process of evaluating our module capacity for next year. Closely connected to any capacity decisions is the timing of our Series 5 and Series 6 product transitions. In regard to Series 5, we are looking very hard at the cost structure and how to bring the module cost per watt down further in this competitive environment. In terms of our Series 6 product, we have dedicated significant resources to focus on how to accelerate the roadmap and product availability. In the current ASP environment without further cost reduction, Series 4 and Series 5 margins may be challenged. We expect that our Series 6 module would be our most competitive product and enable us to capture greater gross margin per watt. Beyond both pricing and capacity decisions, we are also focused on identifying ways to improve our operating expense profile, which would improve our competitiveness. We are progressing in our evaluation of each of these initiatives. However, any final decisions are subject to our normal Board review process. We will hold a separate call on November 16 to discuss the 2017 outlook and provide further updates at that time. Turning to slide five, I'll provide an update on bookings activity since our last earnings call. As we announced in our recent press release, we have signed a PPA of up to 160 megawatts with MCE, a leading community choice aggregator in California. While we are only including 40 megawatts in our bookings number this quarter, we have an option to expand the project to a total of 160 megawatts, subject to satisfaction of certain PPA contract conditions and based on the load increase from potential MCE expansion. Construction of the project is anticipated to begin in 2019 with commissioning expected in 2020. CCAs are increasingly important providers of electricity to customers both in California and a growing number of other states. CCAs offer their customers the benefit of local control, competitive power rates and access to a higher mix of renewable energy. MCE provides power to over 250,000 customers in California and with the addition of other entrants in the CCA market in the coming months, the total CCA customer base in the state is expected to grow to approximately 1 million customers. We are excited to begin a new association with MCE and help make affordable clean power even more accessible. The growth of CCA's across the nation also mirrors the growth of community solar that is occurring across the United States. As we've highlighted last quarter, we have booked over 120 megawatts DC of module supply to community solar projects so far this year. These projects are only part of the rapid growth that is continuing in the community solar space across the United States. While the initial growth in community solar has been specific to certain states, the momentum continues to build. There are now community solar projects in 24 states and 20 additional states are in the process of enacting community solar policies. In 2016 alone, 19 new utilities have started community solar programs. We continue to work closely with Clean Energy Collective and other community solar providers to identify new opportunities to facilitate market growth. Highlighting the growing scale of community solar projects, South Carolina Electric and Gas recently selected CEC to develop, construct and operate a 16 megawatt portfolio of projects. With a much lower cost than rooftop solar and the opportunity to rate base projects in certain situations, community solar is a utility-friendly model that is expected to grow substantially in coming years. Returning to the current quarter, we had module-only bookings of over 200 megawatts since our last call, bringing the total bookings since the last call to nearly 250 megawatts. The largest of these module bookings, approximately 100 megawatts, was to supply our customer awarded volume under the most recent French tender. Module shipments timing will be late Q4 2016 and into 2017. Outside the volume in France, we are seeing increasing geographical diversity at our module-only opportunities. Besides the U.S. we had bookings in Thailand, various countries across Asia and Latin America. As we look forward, we continue to see a number of opportunities that we anticipate will lead to growth \u2013 to stronger module bookings in the next several months. As highlighted last quarter, there are a number of awarded projects, which we had not yet converted to bookings. At this point, we have converted over 160 megawatts of these projects into bookings and they are reflected in today's number. With additional 105 megawatts DC of opportunities related to projects awarded under the recent ARENA large-scale solar grant in Australia, our awarded, but not booked volume now stands at approximately 270 megawatts. As a highlight, the ARENA volume includes our first self developed project in Australia. Keep in mind, this awarded volume is not reflected in slides five and six. Also not included in the bookings number are a number of O&M contracts which we have signed this year. With over 5 gigawatts of generation capacity in operation and more than 7 gigawatts of contracted capacity, First Solar is the recognized industry-leader in providing O&M services for utility-scale solar power plants. With a complete end-to-end solution and fleet availability of 99.6%, First Solar offers customers a compelling combination of expertise and proven performance. Our O&M business continues to grow not only by securing contracts on projects where we perform the EPC, but also through third-party contracts. Year-to-date, we have signed 930 megawatts of third-party O&M agreements. In addition to signing agreements with existing customers, these recent bookings also include six new third-party customers. Beyond these third-party bookings, we have contracted over 540 megawatts of additional volume for projects we have constructed, bringing the total year-to-date O&M bookings to nearly 1.5 gigawatts. With additional advanced stage opportunities currently under negotiation, bookings could reach over 1 point of gigawatts by year-end. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making in third-party O&M business and the stable revenue and earnings it provides. The lower module and system bookings this past quarter are primarily a result of the current module ASP and PPA pricing environment. Our strategy has been to pursue opportunities in markets where we can best leverage the energy yield advantage of our technology while maintaining discipline around returns. However, the willingness of other module manufacturers to continue ramping capacity and selling modules at very aggressive ASPs presents near-term challenges. The decline in ASP environment has also led to some instances where customers have delayed signing agreements in hope of further pricing declines. While achieving a one-to-one book-to-bill ratio this year will be challenging, as we look into the fourth quarter we have a number of bookings opportunities that we believe we are well positioned despite the current market environment. Turning to slide seven, I'll provide an update on our potential bookings opportunities, which has grown to over 25.4 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 1.4 gigawatts from the prior quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities are 1.1 gigawatts with the awarded volume discussed earlier included in this total. Approximately one-third of the late-stage opportunities are systems projects with the balance comprised of module-only sales. The reduction in the mid- to late-stage opportunities since last quarter was approximately 700 megawatts. Of this amount, over 150 megawatts were due to projects that converted into bookings, another 350 megawatts of systems project opportunities were closed in both Egypt and South Africa due to uncertain market conditions in both countries. The remaining decrease was due to projects lost to aggressive pricing terms. In these situations, we chose to remain disciplined and not to match uneconomic pricing. The growth in the overall potential bookings opportunity is primarily driven by new project development opportunities, which we expect to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. The long-term demand driver for solar continues to be strong, and we are working actively to position ourselves to meet the long-term demand. On slide eight, we have updated the geographic mix of our potential bookings. The increase in our potential bookings opportunity is primarily driven by new opportunities in the United States. One of the factors driving the increase in the United States potential bookings is the increase from C&I customers. This continues to develop into a promising utility-scale solar market that we feel we are well-positioned to be successful in upcoming years. Corporations globally have announced plans for renewable procurement that collectively total into 10s of gigawatts. We currently have more than 2 gigawatts of active offers in progress today with C&I customers. Most of these projects are still early stage and have longer dated CODs, but they represent another encouraging demand driver for the long-term growth of solar. One of the factors that provides First Solar an advantage in this market space is the sensitivity C&I customers have to reputational risk. They don't want to see a project fail or not be delivered. With our financial strength and our development track record, we are well-positioned to meet their needs. Lastly, as announced recently, Alex Bradley has been appointed our new Chief Financial Officer. As you are aware, Alex has been serving as our interim CFO since July and has made a seamless transition from his previous responsibility as Head of Project Finance and Treasury. During his time at First Solar, Alex has led or supported the financing and sale of almost all of our utility-scale solar projects. The experience and scale Alex brings into his role will be a tremendous benefit to First Solar and its shareholders. Alex will now provide more detail on the third-quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2016. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks Mark. Before going into the quarter results I want to express my excitement at the opportunity to take on the role of CFO at First Solar. Since I joined the company in 2008, the solar industry has changed enormously and it continues to evolve at a rapid pace. First Solar's unique technology advantages and financial strength position the company for long-term success. And I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead for us. Turning to the quarter, I'll start from slide 11 with some operational highlights. We produced 779 megawatts DC in the third quarter, a decrease of 1% from the prior quarter. The slight decrease is due to an increase in upgrade activities across the fleet, partially offset by higher fleet efficiency. Relative to the third quarter of 2015, production was 19% higher as a result of higher module efficiency, increased capacity utilization and the addition of new capacity. Factory capacity utilization was 97% in Q3, a decrease of three percentage points from the prior quarter. The lower utilization was also a result of the increase in fleet upgrade activities. And as compared to the third quarter of 2015 capacity utilization increased by three percentage points. Fleet average module conversion efficiency increased to 16.5%, a 30 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 70 basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line averaged 16.6% in Q3. As Mark noted, our lead line exited the quarter at 16.9%, highlighting the impact of recent improvement programs deployed. Next on slide 12, I'll discuss the P&L results for the third quarter. Net sales were $688 million, a decrease of $246 million compared to the prior quarter. The sales decrease resulted from lower systems revenue recognition on our Astoria, Silver State South, Kingbird and other projects. The lower systems revenue was partially offset by an increase in module-only sales. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased to 69% from 83% in the prior quarter as a result of the higher mix of module-only sales. Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared to 20% in the second quarter. The improvement in gross margin percentage resulted from the higher mix of third-party module sales as well as improved systems margin resulting from project cost reductions. The gross margin of our component segment was 32% in Q3 compared to 24% in Q2. The increase versus the prior quarter is primarily due to lower module cost per watt from improved efficiency and lower inventory write-downs. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $93 million in Q3, a decrease of $4 million from the prior quarter. Operating expenses decreased primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Restructuring and asset impairment charges of $4 million in the quarter compared to $86 million in Q2. The restructuring charges are related to the actions announced in Q2, including discontinuing our TetraSun product, the disposition of skytron and EPC reductions. The total charges for all these actions are now expected to be slightly lower in a range of $105 million to $115 million compared to the $105 million to $120 million range originally anticipated with most of the impact in 2016. Operating expense savings from these actions is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million per annum. Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income was $93 million for the third quarter compared to $95 million in the prior quarter. The decrease is due to lower revenue partially offset by higher gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses. Other income was $6 million in the third quarter primarily due to the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer. Second quarter other income was $7 million mainly due to reversal of outstanding contingent considerations related to the TetraSun acquisition. We had a tax benefit of $51 million in Q3 compared to tax expense of $9 million in the second quarter. As we indicated on last quarter's call, in July we received a favorable ruling from foreign tax authority, which has resulted in a $35 million tax benefit to our Q3 results. Note that for purposes of our full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance we've excluded this benefit. The third-quarter results also include a tax benefit of $13 million associated with the expiration of a statute to limitations on various uncertain tax positions. Third-quarter earnings were $1.49 per fully diluted share on a GAAP basis and $1.22 on a non-GAAP basis. This compared to earnings of $0.13 and non-GAAP earnings of $0.87 in the prior quarter. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS reconciliation. Turning to slide 13, I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash and marketable securities increased $423 million to an ending balance of $2.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased slightly to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion in the prior quarter as a result of continuing to construct certain projects on balance sheet. The increase in cash resulted primarily from borrowing on our revolving credit facility. With ongoing funding of several substantial projects on the balance sheet, the short-term borrowing on our revolver was necessary to fund domestic requirements, while complying with certain statutory funding requirements. As we sell the projects we have been constructing on balance sheet, we expect to pay down our revolver in either Q4 of 2016 or Q1 of 2017. For the quarter, net working capital, including the change in non-current project assets and excluding cash and marketable securities, decreased by over $430 million, primarily due to the increase in short-term borrowings. Excluding this item, net working capital would have increased primarily due to the growth in project assets. Total debt in the third quarter was $787 million, an increase of $554 million from the prior quarter. And as discussed previously, this increase was primarily due to the borrowing under the revolver. Cash flows used in operations were $76 million, compared to cash flows used in operations of $75 million in Q2. Free cash flow was negative $132 million compared to negative free cash flow of $139 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $46 million compared to $78 million in the prior quarter and depreciation for the quarter was $52 million or approximately $1 million lower than the prior quarter. I'll now discuss the updates to our full-year 2016 guidance on slide 14. Firstly, keep in mind that, as Mark mentioned, we are in the process of evaluating certain decisions related to our production capacity, module product transitions, and operating expense rationalization. As a result, our current view of 2016 guidance on a GAAP basis could be subject to change depending upon the outcome of this process. To the extent there are any changes to 2016 outlook, these will be provided on the 2017 guidance call on November 16. Also, as we've communicated over the course of the year, we constructed our guidance to account for factors that could impact the timing of the large and complex project sales included in our forecasts. As a result of this approach, we've been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance even while our net sales guidance has been lowered, due to revised timing of certain project sales. It's important to keep this context in mind as we discuss the updates. Our net sales guidance has been revised to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the prior guidance of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This change is due to project timing, as we now expect to complete the sale of our Moapa and California Flats projects in 2017. Regarding Moapa, we recently closed tax equity financing for the project and received a portion of the cash in Q4. The marketing of the remaining cash equity has generated considerable interest and we expect that sale to close in Q1 of 2017. In relation to our Stateline project, we've offered our remaining 34% interest at 8point3. The project sale is advancing and is expected to close by year-end. In the guidance that we provided today, we are including only a portion of the remaining 34% interest in the project pending the final approval and closing of the sale. As previously indicated, to the extent that we do sell the entire remaining interest in 2016 this will likely result in earnings at or above the high end of the guidance range provided today. As a reminder, the profit from the remaining sale to 8point3 will be reflected below operating income in equity and earnings and not in revenue and gross margin. Resulting from the changes in the timing of project sales we're updating our gross margin guidance to 25.5% to 26% from 18.5% to 19% previously. The increase in the gross margin percentage is a reflection of both the relatively low gross margin associated with the Moapa and California Flats projects that have been pushed out and also other project cost savings achieved in Q3. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $480 million to $500 million and include $105 million to $115 million of restructuring-related charges. Note that the expected TetraSun charges have been lowered to a range of $90 million to $95 million from the prior range of up to $100 million. Non-GAAP guidance for our operating expenses, which excludes restructuring charges, have been reduced to $375 million to $385 million. We brought down the high end of this range from $400 million reflecting our ongoing efforts to manage expenses. The non-GAAP operating income guidance has been narrowed to a range of $340 million to $370 million, reflecting the updated net sales and gross margin expectations. A non-GAAP effective tax rate has been revised to a range of 8% to 10% resulting from a favorable jurisdictional mix of income. Keep in mind that this excludes the impact of all restructuring actions and also excludes the impact of the $35 million tax benefit mentioned earlier. On a GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share in the range of $3.75 to $3.90 and on a non-GAAP basis $4.30 to $4.50. As touched upon earlier, we're maintaining the high end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance at $4.50 while tightening the low-end to $4.30. The increase in the low-end reflects the lower operating expenses and lower expected tax rate. The benefit of project cost reductions in Q3 also helped to offset the impact of the lower revenue from project push-outs. Included in the EPS range is the expected Q4 sale of a portion of our remaining interest in Stateline and First Solar's share of 8point3's earnings. The equity in earnings amount is approximately $110 million net of tax. Also keep in mind that, as mentioned last quarter, a net sales range in gross margin guidance include only a portion of the revenue and none of the deferred profit from the Kingbird sale. Similarly, the EPS guidance provided does not include the $0.16 of deferred Kingbird earnings. Due to the tax equity structure on this project, all earnings have been deferred for the next several years. Our operating cash flow guidance has been revised to a range of negative $100 million to breakeven from a prior range of $500 million to $650 million, and the decrease is due to the revised sale timing of Moapa and California Flats. We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to a revised range of $225 million to $275 million from the prior range of $275 million to $325 million, as the timing of certain expenditures has now moved into 2017. Net cash guidance has been reduced to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the revised timing of project sales, partially offset by a reduction in CapEx. And finally, we are also slightly reducing our shipment guidance for the year based on timing of certain shipments pushing into early 2017. Turning to slide 15. I'll summarize our progress during the third quarter. Our financial results are as followed : revenue of $688 million, GAAP EPS of $1.49 to non-GAAP EPS of $1.22. We maintain the high end of our 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP EPS ranges at $3.90 and $4.50, respectively. Our module efficiency continues to improve steadily, and our best line efficiency exited Q3 running at 16.9%. Our bookings this quarter were lower than expected, at approximately 250 megawatts. However, we continue to see growth in a number of potential booking opportunities, including with C&I customers. With that, we'll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. We'll take our first question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): It seems like what you're intending to say is that as you go through this decision making process that you may just skip over the Gen 5 and go straight to Gen 6. With this call only a couple of weeks away, what can you tell us about the final decision that you're trying to make at this point, as we try to get a sense of where we're going to come out in a couple of weeks on this guidance? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So, Colin, what we've done here and we engaged, probably, I guess, maybe four weeks to six weeks ago, I think it is. We put two tiger teams together, if you want to use that term, to do somewhat of a bake-off \u2013 right \u2013 to look at both Series 5 and Series 6 and what is the art of the possible and what can we do to further reduce the cost on Series 5 as well as trying to find a path to what can we do to try to accelerate the timing of Series 6. Our long-term plan has always been to have the two products coexist. But given the current market environment, we're reevaluating that and we're trying to make a decision that if we can get the cost profile of Series 5 down to a level, which we think it needs to be to give us acceptable margins on the sale of that product then we'll move forward with that transition. If we're not able to do that, we may look to move straight into a Series 6 platform with a view of trying to put one product forward as quickly as possible. We have been having ongoing discussions with our internal teams. We've had ongoing discussions with subcommittees within our board and we'll have our final review with the board next week and we'll make a decision from there. And whatever that decision is, we'll make sure that we communicate that to everyone on the earnings call on the 16. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tyler Frank with Robert W. Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple of large utilities including Southern Company and NextEra recently announced that they were going to limit their spending on solar projects. They were going to focus more on other renewables including wind going forward. Can you discuss how that might impact things and sort of what you're seeing for the utility-scale landscape right now including the competitive environment? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, so I think NextEra and Southern have both announced that based on how they view the economics and risk reward of solar projects they're going to perhaps reduce spending in solar and look more at wind. I think that neither of them has said that they're going to be exiting solar market and we clearly have good relationships with both of those two counterparties. They'll still be looking for high quality assets. And I think we're both \u2013 we're well positioned to meet those opportunities. What we have seen clearly in the latter half of 2016 and going into 2017 is there is somewhat of a scarcity of tax capacity for large utility-scale assets. That being said, given the ITC extension timing, there's also a dearth of assets going into 2017. So we think the two have somewhat balanced out, although there may be a little challenging tax capacity issues at some point. The other thing I would say is that we feel that we bring extremely high quality projects to market. And given both the quality of the projects, the development and the relationships we have with counterparties in the market, we don't see a significant constraint today for us in finding buyers and tax capacity for our assets. It may be that further down the chain there are some people who are struggling but we're still not seeing that reflected in our markets today. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just better understand what kind of component margins would be acceptable assuming you're able to lower your cost for Series 5 or maybe even Series 6 when you guys start ramping? I don't assume that you're going to get back to the 25%, 26% levels that you've seen in the past. And then, can you maybe talk about, Q4 \u2013 is your revenue outlook for Q4 mostly all component shipments or are you also assuming some systems? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: In terms of on the margin profile for our component module sales, in our view our entitlement still should be in that 20% range. There is no reason to believe that we shouldn't be able to achieve those types of margins. And what we need to make sure is that we can deliver that with a Series 5 product and that's what we're working on, trying to get the cost down to a point where we think we'll clear the market on the ASP and still be able to deliver margins that are in that range. Our expectation is that a Series 6 product will deliver even better margins than that. So I wouldn't want to change our view of the long-term expectations around gross margin for our module-only sales. With our Series 4 product today, given the smaller form factor, it will make it in today's pricing environment more challenging to achieve those types of margins and we would obviously most likely see margins much lower than the 20%. That's what precipitates the need to transition to either Series 5 or Series 6 to normalize the form factor delta that we have today in the marketplace and generally drives a slightly lower value for the product. As it relates to Q4 and our mix of revenue, there is still some systems revenue in the fourth quarter. But you will see a significantly high proportion of that being module-only sales. Operator : We'll take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. In the recent past, you've talked about a 3 gigawatt year for 2017, 2 gigawatts for external modules and 1 gigawatt for systems. I know you have your call coming up and so forth, but you have talked about this in the past. With California Flats and Moapa slated for 2017 now, that brings in more than 500 megawatts of systems to 2017. So how should we be thinking about volumes now for 2017? Is it more of a 3.5 gigawatt target? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, so I think we'll discuss capacity on the call in a couple of weeks. As it relates to both Moapa and Cal Flats, we'll be completing the sales of those assets in 2017 but a significant portion of the modules have shipped in 2016. When you look to the 2017 shipment numbers that we discussed previously of approximately 3 gigawatts \u2013 split gigawatt systems, 2 gigawatt modules. The total capacity we'll discuss again in a couple of weeks. If you look at the systems business today, we've booked approximately 550 megawatts of systems shipments into 2017 today. We have about another 100 megawatts of relatively late-stage opportunities that takes us to between 600 megawatts and 700 megawatts. Beyond that, we have seen some opportunities to pull out of that pipeline. So asked Mark mentioned in his comments earlier in Egypt, we've seen some opportunities go by the wayside there based on development issues. And likewise, we've passed on some opportunities in India and Africa based on pricing where we won't chase the pricing to the bottom and we won't go into deals that are uneconomic for us. So if you look at 2017 today, I think we're confident in a 600 megawatt to 700 megawatt number in terms of shipments, which is less than we hoped for, but we also continue to have a robust pipeline and continue to look for other opportunities. Operator : We will take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I know that, well, just over 500 megawatts of Moapa and California Flats are shifting into 2017. And it looks like that seems to be the main reason for what \u2013 a 700 basis point increase in margin \u2013 gross margin in 2016, that's for the full year. I mean, I haven't done the math yet, but the implied gross margin on those projects must be very low, arguably in the single-digits. Am I correct and what does this mean for 2017 gross margin? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, so what I would say is there are two things impacting that margin. One is we've had good execution on projects this year, so we've had some project cost savings that have pushed the numbers higher than expected. The other piece \u2013 the two assets we're referencing, both Moapa and Cal Flats, are legacy assets that had some unique challenges to them that made them lower gross margins than you would otherwise see on our typical systems business. The Moapa is an asset that we acquired in late-stage development and therefore paid a development premium to acquire. On Cal Flats, we have one discrete development issue which if resolved, would increase that margin significantly but that's not currently in the guidance numbers. So those two assets have some unique differences from what I would say is a typical development project. If you look out into 2017, we don't have I think significant, similar challenges on the assets that we have in 2017. And then going out beyond that, the majority of our California pipeline out to 2018 and 2019 is at higher margin levels that we think are more expected and accessible for a systems development business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Can you go into a little bit more detail on Stateline recognition here just in terms of the project sale process with Kathy (37:30)? You said you assumed a certain percentage. Can you elaborate a little bit, A, what that percentage is; and B, what the nuances around where that will come out? And what that upside could be or at least give some parameters around what that upside could be? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Julien, as you know, 8point3 has gone out and recently done an equity raise plus they've also expanded their credit agreement. They had an accordion feature underneath the credit agreement, which they expanded that; I think the capacity was around $250 million. They've also recently acquired Henrietta, and so they've used some of the capacity for that. So what we are trying to do with 8point3 is there is limited capacity in terms of their ability to acquire the entire interest. Clearly there is an interest from 8point3 to do that. We are trying to work through structuring around that to see if we can accomplish that. And to the extent that we can then we will be able to sell 100% of our remaining interest, which was 34% of Stateline. We have left out of the guidance approximately 25% of the value, which is depending upon our ability to go above and beyond or find ways to sell 100% even though there is not today presently sufficient capacity to acquire 100% interest in Stateline given the available cash and debt capacity that 8point3 has at this point in time. So we're just looking through options, so in our guidance we've excluded a portion of the sale and that's about 25% of the remaining interest. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a couple. First on California Flats, what sort of timing should we expect in 2017? And then given the EPS range is basically unchanged here with a few of the benefits from other lines, I back into about $0.80 of EPS at the midpoint that Cal Flats and Moapa represented. Is that reasonable and would it change now that you're monetizing those assets later? And then just quickly on the updated guidance for 2016, the non-GAAP tax rate, could you reconcile what exactly is driving the $0.40 of EPS relative to your prior guidance? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So, I guess, Brian, on the tax rate, I think what you're seeing is the delta between the GAAP and the non-GAAP, first off is we highlighted that we had a favorable ruling on an item in an international jurisdiction, which was worth about $35 million or about $0.35. That is in our GAAP numbers but that's not reflected in our non-GAAP numbers. So that's kind of our primary delta between the two. The other side of it is relative to our prior outlook on the tax rate, we have a favorable mix of income. So what's happened now with the drop in revenue that drives a different result in terms of where is the income by jurisdictional mix, which each jurisdictional mix had a different tax rate associated with it. And as you know, we have a tax holiday in Malaysia, so more of the income that's represented in Malaysia as a percent of the total will drive down the overall tax rate. So that's kind of the events that are driving the change in the tax rate both on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis from the prior guidance that we provided in Q2 earnings call. Brian, I'm not really sure how you're getting the $0.80 or so for Moapa and CA Flats. I think Paul had it right when \u2013 and he referenced it; when you look at the revenue delta, which was close to $1 billion, and if you look at the gross margin rate increasing, but when you look at the total gross margin dollars not changing significantly, you would look to it and say, well, that would imply that the gross margin on both of those assets is lower than normally expected for a systems business. I think Alex walked through that as well. So we can take that off-line if you like. We can spend more time with you, but you should not be getting anywhere close to, I think you referenced round $0.80 of value for the push out of those two projects. It will be significantly lower than that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with Guggenheim. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good evening. And thank you for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could give us some sense with your expanding O&M portfolio, what are the economics of those contracts? What do they look like and how should we think about the contribution of that type of business going forward? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So the O&M business, again it's a good business, it's a recurring annuity stream, relatively high fixed cost, therefore, variable volume flows through at a very high contribution rate. And the profile on the business if you look at it over time, the margins can range \u2013 the margins on average are above the average for the business. They also will be much higher, let's say, in the first five or six years of the contract. So if you look at the performance of the plan as well as the warrantees that you have with the inverter manufacturers and others, you will generally realize much higher margins within the first five to seven years. And then as you approach 10 years to 15 years you may see margins start to drop off a little bit, especially if you have to do overhaul \u2013 inverter overhaul maintenance and those types of things. But it's a good margin business. It's one that is really based off of scale and we are looking to \u2013 we have a strong presence here in the U.S. We are looking to grow it and capture the benefit of the infrastructure through our network operating center and other investments that we've made over the years to monitor plants and try to find other ways to optimize the performance of the plants. It's a good base business that has great opportunity to continue to grow. The revenue dollars won't be sizable in general relative to the total, but they can contribute meaningful gross margin and EPS. Operator : We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, I had like a longer-term question. Three months ago you guys spoke about Series 5 being probably 1 gigawatt in 2017 and then as the module price continued to decline 15%, it forced you to rethink the strategy. I'm kind of curious if module price continues to decline another 25% to 30% over the next 12 months or 18 months, would Series 6 be highly profitable and what are the levels you have for lowering your overall cost at this point? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So a couple things, around Series 5 in particular is that what we are focused on Series 5, and I want to make sure it's clear, is that if we can further cost reduce it, and we're looking at ways to do that, the product will be highly competitive. So I don't want it to be looked upon as that it's a direct correlation that the ASPs have declined and therefore the product is no longer competitive. It is an advantaged product relative to Series 4 because it solves our difference in form factor which drives \u2013 generally drives a higher balance of plant cost. So it's a very valuable product from that standpoint. The challenge though is getting, so that there is some incremental costs that we are adding to the module and in terms of back rails and other things along those lines. So it can drive to a higher cost point than Series 4, but the general benefits of the larger form factor is offsetting the impact of that higher cost. What we're trying to find a way is that can we further cost reduce some of the incremental components for Series 5 or just the bill of material or other ways of driving out cost on Series 5 that we can get it to a position that we feel more comfortable in competing in the marketplace and capturing the margin profile that we would like. The other thing I think that's important to understand is that if \u2013 when we first embarked around our vision for Series 6, it was a little over a year ago. And we have had tremendous learnings around Series 6 that have dealt with some of the potential constraints or challenges/risk that we had with Series 6, when we first sat down and created the business case. If we had known everything that we know as of now for Series 6, we may have made a decision to go straight to Series 6. Okay. So some of it is \u2013 look, the ASPs in the market have declined. That's putting some pressure on Series 5. We've got to further cost reduce it. If we can do that, then we'll continue with the transition. However, we also have an opportunity to meaningfully pull forward Series 6 in getting that product into market faster. Then, we just have to compare the trade-offs between the two and make a decision on which path we want to go. Series 6 at any price point that we're seeing in the market right now will exceed any of our expectations around margins of what we believe that business \u2013 that entitlement should be. So we're very confident with the Series 6 around its efficiency as well as the cost entitlement, and it generates all of the energy yield benefits around temperature coefficient, spectral response, diffuse shading, everything you could possibly. And obviously that we've talked about around the core to our technology, it still resides in Series 6. So we can just have much higher efficiency, much greater energy density at a much lower cost point. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our final question from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Back in April, at the analyst day, you talked about the price advantage that you can get in hot climate areas such as India. With the module pricing meltdown since then industry-wide, have you been able to retain that advantage in the hot climates or has that kind of dissipated away? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: No. Look, the inherent energy value and the benefits are there, and we are able to capture that. India is a great market for our product and one that we can capture meaningful incremental value for the energy that we provide. So there's nothing has changed, the ASP environment doesn't change that. What has some impact, not necessarily around percent energy advantage, but the value of the energy can be impacted with PPA prices. So it's intuitive, the lower the PPA price therefore the lower the value of the energy. So there is some impact of that as PPA prices in some markets have gotten very aggressive. But the inherent energy value is still there. The percent deltas are still there. The only real dynamic that can change the equation around what does it translate into ASP is what is the underlying PPA and generally lower PPA means less value in the ASP. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you.",

Analysts: Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management) Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update, then Alex will discuss our fourth quarter and full-year financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. While market conditions and pricing remain challenging in the fourth quarter of last year, we finished 2016 with strong results. An important part of our DNA at First Solar is to set challenging goals and hold our-self accountable to them. At our guidance call in December of 2015 and as a part of our Analyst Day in April of 2016, we provided operational and financial metrics for investors to measure our progress against. As Alex will review later, we have been able to meet and even exceed these targets. First Solar's ability to deliver on commitments also extends to our multiyear plans. For instance, at our 2013 Analyst Day, we outlined a goal to achieve an exit efficiency of 16.9% at a module cost per watt of $0.45 by the end of 2016. Nearly four years later, our best line exited 2016 at over 16.9% conversion efficiency and our module cost per watt for the year beat our target by a wide margin. These are remarkable achievements that demonstrate the expertise and execution capabilities of the First Solar team, and give us confident as we again set challenging goals related to the Series 6 program. Since making the decision to accelerate our transition to Series 6, the First Solar organization has been completely focused on executing to our planned roadmap. These efforts fall under the areas of both product and market readiness. While we'll be covering our product readiness efforts on today's call, we have been actively engaged with customers and ecosystem partners to educate them and solicit feedback from them on this powerful new product. We are very pleased with the initial customer reaction in market readiness assessment. We will provide more details related to this ongoing work on our Q1 call. Turning now to slide 4, I'll review the efforts and progress we're making to ensure our Series 6 module meets the performance, cost and production targets we have established. Firstly, it is important to put in proper context the risk of this transition. While there're undoubtedly challenges involved, there are several key factors that reduce the overall risk profile and give us confidence in our ability to successfully deploy Series 6. Most significantly, our Series 6 module will utilize essentially the same underlying solar cell technology as our Series 4 product. Given this, we believe the core technology risks involved in the transition is low. The analogy we have used in the past is that this is similar to what and how the flat panel display industry scale from one generation to the next. We are not reinventing the core technology behind Series 6, but rather increasing the module form factor. In addition, we're deploying this new technology with experienced R&D personnel, deploying it in our existing factory locations with manufacturing teams that have collectively produced over 17 gigawatts of CadTel modules. The cumulative years of experience, working with this technology within our organization, provides us with the skill set required to successfully launch and ramp the Series 6 production platform. In a similar matter, but external to the company, we are leveraging the expertise of the long-trusted equipment supplier for our core product technology tools. In some cases, we have been working with these suppliers for nearly a decade and their capabilities are well established and proven. While there clearly are risks associated with scaling to a larger form factor, we see these risks as manufacture-related in nature and not technology centered. While manufacturing risks such as throughput and yield could possibly impact the Series 6 launch, our experience indicates that overcoming these types of challenges can be addressed with a proper focus and resources. From a performance standpoint, we are focused both on reaching our target of greater than 18% efficiency as well as continuing our existing standard of excellence and reliability that our customers have come to expect. While our target efficiency represents a greater than 100-basis-point improvement from our current fleet performance, the path to achieve this performance is largely based on proven and well-understood methods that we will now be able to deploy on our new Series 6 equipment addressing certain limitations in our existing toolset. One portion of the efficiency improvement comes from the scaling of our form factor, which increases the active area of glass relative to the total area. Another efficiency improvement comes from changes to electrical design of the module, a process that we have experience with and which is well proven. The remaining efficiency improvement will be designed into certain process tools, where we'll again leverage the expertise of our longstanding equipment suppliers. On the quality and reliability side, we are applying our same change management systems, which has enabled us to produce multiple gigawatts of world-class modules, while driving up efficiencies over the past number of years. Intensive validation of the elements of our Series 6 design has already begun, including among other methods, utilizing accelerated life testing and field exposure testing. Ensuring we reach our target module cost per watt in Series 6 is another critical aspect of our product readiness efforts. One area we have made tremendous progress is our CapEx per watt target. We have now solidified our ability to meet and even potentially do better than our $0.30 per watt CapEx target for brownfield capacity. This has been achieved through negotiations with our suppliers and by expanding our supply base for non-critical process tools. Regarding the factory labor component of our cost per watt, we have worked through extensive evaluations of our labor requirement and determined that we are also on track. As relates to the material cost of the module, we will continue to negotiate with both existing and new suppliers to further drive down material costs and enable us to achieve our targeted cost profile. Taken all together, we view the challenging cost per watt target we have set for Series 6 as appropriate. Turning to slide 5, I'll review some of the key milestones that we are providing in order to evaluate our progress of the Series 6 deployment. Note, the updates currently provided are limited to our initial pilot line in the Ohio factory and the first full scale production facility in Malaysia. In subsequent quarters, we will add key milestone for the additional production facilities included in our manufacturing roadmap. Near the end of last year, we stopped production of four lines at our Ohio factory and began preparation for the installation of our Series 6 pilot line. At this point in Q1, we have placed orders for the large majority of the tools including all the major equipment required for the initial pilot. Over the course of the coming months, we will work closely with our suppliers to factory test and validate the tools before the equipment begins to arrive at our Ohio location in the third quarter. By the end of the third quarter, the core Series 6 tools, which include equipment such as our coders are expected to be operational. We expect to complete the frontend of our pilot line in the fourth quarter, with production target started in the second quarter of 2018. Our Ohio plant is expected to have a nameplate capacity of 550 megawatts when fully ramped by Q4 of 2018. With regards to our Malaysia factory, we will be stopping Series 4 production on eight lines within the next two months. Tool ordering for Malaysia production has already commenced, and will continue into Q2 of this year. Production startup in Malaysia is targeted for Q3 2018 through Q4 of 2018. Once fully ramped by Q1 of 2019, this portion of Malaysia factory is expected to have approximately 1.1 gigawatts of Series 6 capacity. While this is the first look at our key milestones, we'll continue to update and add additional relevant information as needed going forward. Turning to slide 6, I'll focus on some of the bookings activity since our third quarter earnings call last November. Our most recent bookings are highlighted by encouraging progress in the Asia-Pacific region. In Australia, we reached a new milestone with the award of the PPA for our first self-developed project in the country. The approximately 50-megawatt AC Manildra Solar Farm, which was awarded under a grant under the ARENA program's large solar scale program. We'll begin shipping module to the project in 2017 with the expected completion in 2018. In addition, we have recently signed two separate module supply agreements, which combine total over 200 megawatts DC. The 140-megawatt DC supply agreement with Sun Metals will provide energy to the company's zinc refinery and will be the largest solar power plant in Australia once completed. In a separate transaction, we will be supplying 63 megawatts DC for the first phase of the Kidston Solar Project, which will be co-located with the Pumped Storage Project. Note, Series 6 will be well-positioned for the Kidston's potential second phase. Shipments to both projects are scheduled in 2017. We're enthusiastic about our recent success in Australia and the growth potential of the large-scale utility solar market in the region, where our technology hold a strong energy advantage. In Japan, we closed our first non-recourse syndicated project financing led by Mizuho Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in Japan, for our 59-megawatt project in Ishikawa. The financing arrangement demonstrates First Solar's technology, project development and project financing capabilities for utility-scale solar projects in Japan. Additionally, we have booked two new development projects with a combined size of nearly 50 megawatts DC. Module shipments to the two project will take place over the course of 2017 and 2018. These bookings bring our contracted Japan development pipeline to over 180 megawatts DC, including 10 smaller projects which have commenced operations. We're encouraged by the future opportunities we have in the market, based on our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities that now total over 350 megawatts DC. In the United States, we signed an agreement with a major ITP to supply modules to a 200-megawatt DC power plant in the Desert Southwest. Module shipments to the project are also scheduled for this year. The remaining bookings for the quarter were primarily module-only sales in India, Turkey and other parts of Europe. As it relates to Turkey, we recently announced a collaborative sales agreement with Zorlu Holdings. Under the five-year agreement, Zorlu has the right to distribute CadTel technology in Turkey and 25 other countries, primarily in Southeast Europe, the CIS and Central Asia. The agreement will support Zorlu's distribution efforts as well as bolster our indirect sales model. As part of the agreement, First Solar's business development team in Turkey will transition to Zorlu. In recent years, our strategy has been to dedicate sales and operational resources to select markets that are sufficient scale, and with sufficient long-term sustainable growth to support direct OpEx. In other parts of the world, where there is demand for solar, but the market opportunity requires a greater local presence, our indirect model with partners such as Zorlu and Caterpillar offer an effective and OpEx-like solution. We'll provide more updates in the future on our collaboration progresses. Returning to our recent bookings, since the last quarter, we have booked over 650 megawatts DC. For the 2016 calendar year, we booked 1.8 gigawatts with additional bookings of over 400 megawatts so far this year. While our book-to-bill ratio for 2016 fell below our target of 1 to 1, this is large part due to the challenging ASP environment. Module ASPs began to decline significantly in July of 2016. As we observed the declines, we engaged the market with a price discovery approach to determine the market clearing price. During this period of time, we were out of price position, which is reflected in the relatively low booking volumes in the second half of 2016. We took actions to correct this, based on the observed market clearing prices, and this is reflected in the bookings momentum we have seen since our last earnings call. Netted against these recent bookings is the removal of our pipeline of a 310-megawatt AC Tribal Solar development project, which was awarded in an RFP process in 2014. In light of significant uncertainties and risks related to land use rights, we have discontinued the development of this project. As it relates to our remaining contracted development pipeline, we view this as an isolated event based on risks specific to this project. While this decreases our volume of contracted shipments in the 2020 and 2021 timeframe, we see opportunities to offset this impact as in the case of our 350 megawatts of potential bookings in Japan previously discussed, and leveraging the strength of our Series 6 product. Net of the reduction of Tribal Solar, our remaining contracted shipments now stand at 3.3 gigawatts DC. Turning briefly to slide 7, our remaining 3.3-gigawatt of contracted volume equates to $5 billion of future expected value as of today's call. The decreases in expected value over the course of the year is due to the higher mix of systems business recognized in 2016 as compared to the higher mix of third-party module bookings during the year. The remaining $5 billion total on this slide is also net of future expected value of Tribal Solar. Note that, going forward, we intend to discontinue the use of this metric. Near term, majority of our bookings will be focused on selling through the remaining Series 4 volume, which is anticipated to primarily be module-only sales. Longer term, as we grow our production platform by leveraging the strength of our Series 6 product, we will see a shift to more module-only sales. Given the book-to-bill velocity of module-only sale is much shorter than a system development project sale, the inherent value of a multi-year forward-looking contracted pipeline is diminished. This is consistent with our prior statement that the system business will reflect approximately 1 gigawatt of annual volume with the balance, approximately 2.5 gigawatts, based on 2019 anticipated production being module-only. An important new metric that we're providing on slide 8 is the sell-through status of our expected remaining Series 4 production. The first thing to keep in mind is that the 3.6 gigawatts to 3.8 gigawatts of the Series 4 supply is representative of both current inventory and expected future production into 2018. Depending on certain factors, including market demand, module pricing and the progress of our Series 6 ramp, we may decide to adjust the ramp downtime of certain Series 4 lines, which could impact Series 4 supply by up to 200 megawatts. Note, transitioning resources earlier in 2018 from Series 4 to Series 6 will allow for a more efficient launch in our Ohio facility. Again, the total forecasted Series 4 supply approximately 600 megawatts which will be allocated to our own project pipeline with additional 1.4 gigawatts contracted for delivery to third-party customers. These amounts are inclusive of bookings we've discussed on today's call. With over half of the project volume already contracted, we're making good progress in selling out of our Series 4 supply. In addition to the 2 gigawatts already contracted, we have a number of mid-to-late stage opportunities that could be contracted against the remaining supply as shown on slide 9. Note, approximately 50% of this volume is in late-stage negotiations. Previously, we've provided a view of our entire portfolio of potential bookings including early-stage projects. In this year, we are focusing on only those mid-to-late stage opportunities, which have the greatest likelihood of bookings. We continue to track a large number of early-stage opportunities and while the total has increased since our last earnings call, we feel this targeted view is more relevant as we transition from Series 4 to Series 6. Of the opportunities highlighted, approximately 1.7 gigawatts of our Series 4 delivery with the remaining 500 gigawatts of opportunity is associated with Series 6. Again, there exists a much larger pipeline of early-stage opportunities, but this view is only for those in mid-to-late stages. Of the 2.2 gigawatts of potential bookings, we continue to have the most opportunity in the U.S. across both development and module sales. Most notably, there are over 500-megawatt DC of module sales opportunities in the U.S. that are in late-stage negotiations, and once booked, would reduce remaining Series 4 supply. APAC includes the Japan pipeline mentioned as well as additional opportunities in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. In Europe, the majority of the opportunities shown are in France. India continues to be an important market. And while our higher profitability opportunities are strong, we have a much larger number of early-stage projects in this market. Lastly, while we have historically held our Analyst Day event in the spring of each year; this year, we will be changing the time of the meeting to the fourth quarter. Later this year, we will be further into our Series 6 transition and the revised timing allows us to have a more meaningful information to share. We'll provide more details on the timing and location of the event at a future date. Alex will now provide more details on the fourth quarter and 2016 financial results, and discuss updated guidance for 2017. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Before reviewing the financial results for the quarter, I'll turn first to recap our accomplishments in 2016. In terms of efficiency, we met the targets we outlined in April at our Analyst Day. Our 2016 full fleet efficiency of 16.4% is an 80-basis point improvement versus 2015 and a remarkable 320-basis point improvement since 2013. Our full fleet exited the year at 16.7%, also meeting the target we set in April. In addition to achieving our efficiency target for 2016, we also met and even exceeded the module cost per watt target that we set. While we did not disclose that number, we beat the 2016 cost goal and our cost per watt decreased by 16% compared to full-year 2015. From a financial perspective, we also delivered strong results for the year. The initial 2016 earnings per share midpoint we provided in late 2015 was $4.25 per share. In November, we raised our earnings midpoint to $4.70 per share. Our non-GAAP or operational earnings of $5.17 per share for the year exceeded both our original and revised guidance for EPS. While our revenue and net cash came in below the initial guidance provided, that's a result of revised timing of certain project sales. So, in summary, we delivered on our commitments this past year and continue to apply the same discipline and focus to the objectives we've outlined for the coming years. Beginning on slide 12, I'll highlight the operational achievements for the past quarter. Fourth quarter module production was 760 megawatts DC, a decrease of 2% from the prior quarter, due to the production stop on certain lines in Ohio related to our Series 6 transition. The ramp down of these lines also impacted our capacity utilization, which decreased to 92% in Q4 versus 97% in the third quarter. Capacity utilization was 100% in the same quarter of 2015 as all lines are operating with minimal efficiency upgrade activities. Our conversion efficiency for our full fleet averaged 16.6% in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter and a 50-basis point increase year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line improved to a Q4 average of 16.8%, a 20-basis-point improvement versus Q3. Our lead line exited Q4 at 16.9%, which was unchanged from the prior quarter. Turning to slide 13, I'll next touch on some of the income statement highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. Note that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new accounting standard for the treatment of share-based compensation, which resulted in changes to tax expense, operating cash flows and financing cash flows. The following net income and earnings comparisons to prior quarters are also reflective of this change and more information related to the adoption of the new standard will be available on our 10-K. In addition to reviewing our income statement results, I'll be discussing certain non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Net sales were $480 million, a decrease of $208 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in net sales resulted from the completion of the Taylor, East Pecos, Astoria and Butler projects in the quarter. The lower revenue from these projects in Q4 was partially offset by the sale of our Shams Ma'an project in Jordan and higher third-party module sales. For 2016, net sales were $3 billion as compared to $3.6 billion in the prior year. Also keep in mind that the Q4 sale of our remaining interest in the Stateline project to 8point3 for $280 million in cash and a $50 million promissory notes was not accounted for as revenue, rather profit on this sale was recognized in equity in earnings. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, decreased from 69% in the prior quarter to 48% in Q4, resulting from the higher third-party module sales and completion of systems projects mentioned. For the full year, solar power systems revenue was 77% of total revenue. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 13% compared to 27% in the prior quarter. The decrease in gross margin percentage was a result of the mix of projects recognized between the periods, and a $25 million non-cash impairment of our Barilla Solar Project in Texas, which is classified in PV solar power systems on our balance sheet. For 2016, gross margin percentage was 24% compared to 26% for the prior year. The project impairment had an approximately 500-basis point and 80-basis point impact on Q4 and full-year 2016 gross margin respectively. The 30-megawatt Barilla project was originally developed to sell power in Texas on an uncontracted basis in order to help penetrate the Texas market as well as to provide a test site for the implementation of new technologies. We've seen benefits from this effort in the form of our successful development sale of the East Pecos project along with the successful launch of our 1,500-volt inverter infrastructure. However, declines in retail power prices since the completion of the project in 2014 have resulted in ongoing operational losses that necessitated the write-down in value. Gross margin of our components segment was 16% in Q4 compared to 32% in the prior quarter. The decrease is primarily due to the Barilla impairment and lower third-party module ASPs. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $100 million in Q4. This compares to Q3 adjusted OpEx of $93 million. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter included approximately $8 million for the impairment of development costs associated with the Tribal Solar project. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses were $388 million. Restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our Series 6 transition was $729 million and $819 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 respectively. These charges were primarily non-cash and the Q4 charges were higher than the anticipated restructuring charges of $500 million to $700 million provided during our guidance call in November as well as to our initial estimate impairment charges in our Series 4 manufacturing lines were higher than anticipated. Note also that charges of $40 million to $60 million related to the cancellation of our Series 5 operations, which were included in this range, are now expected to be incurred in 2017. Excluding restructuring related items, we had an operating loss for the quarter of $34 million compared to adjusted operating income of $98 million in Q3. The decrease is primarily due to the Barilla asset impairment, projects impairments, lower revenue and the mix of projects recognized. Keep in mind that the $125 million profit on the sale of the Stateline project is not included in operating income. On a GAAP basis, our operating loss for the quarter was $765 million and the 2016 operating loss was $503 million. Other expense was $8 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impairments of a cost method investment. We had tax expense of $90 million in the fourth quarter compared to tax benefit of $66 million in Q3. The tax expense included $196 million associated with the distribution of approximately $750 million of cash to the U.S. from a foreign subsidiary. Of the $196 million tax expense, only $7 million is expected to result in a cash payment. For the full year, our tax expense was $58 million compared to a benefit of $6 million in the prior year. Full-year tax expense was impacted by the tax from the distribution of cash, partially offset by a $35 million tax benefit in Q3 from a favorable ruling from its foreign tax authority. Equity in earnings was $146 million in Q4, primarily composed to the profit on the sale of our remaining interest in the Stateline project and earnings from our investment in 8point3. This compares to $11 million of equity in earnings in the third quarter, which was comprised primarily of equity in earnings from our investment in 8point3. For the full year, we recognized $172 million of equity in earnings compared to $20 million in the prior year. Altogether, in the fourth quarter, we recognized the loss of $6.92 per share on a GAAP basis and earnings to fully diluted share of $1.24 on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to GAAP earnings of $1.63 in the prior quarter. For 2016, our loss per share on a GAAP basis was $3.33 and earnings per share was $5.17 on a non-GAAP basis. This exceeds the $4.80 high-end of EPS guidance we provided on our last update and significantly higher than the $4.50 high-end of EPS guidance in our original 2016 guidance. Relative to our non-GAAP EPS guidance, our results exceeded our guidance as a result of higher sales value for the remaining interest in the Stateline project and lower taxes. At the time of our guidance update in November, the final structure of the Stateline sale to 8point3 had not received final board approval, and a portion of the sales proceeds were not fully reflected in our guidance. I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information on slide 14. Our cash and marketable securities balance was slightly below $2 billion at the end of 2016, and decreased to $135 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position improved by $464 million to nearly $1.8 billion, as we had strong cash receipts in Q4. We also paid off our borrowing on our revolver during the quarter. In Q4, our net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, increased by slightly more than $450 million. The change was primarily related to repayment on the revolver and higher project assets, partially offset by an increase in other liabilities. Total debt was $188 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $599 million from the prior quarter. The decrease primarily resulted from $550 million repayment of our borrowing under our revolving credit facility and the partial repayment of a project-related VAT loan. Cash flows from operations were $268 million in Q4 compared to cash flows used in operations of $84 million in the prior quarter. Free cash flow was $215 million compared to negative free cash flow of $130 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $54 million as compared to $46 million in the prior quarter. For 2016, operating cash flows were $207 million. The cash generation of the business was very strong this past year, particularly when taking into account a couple of different factors. Firstly, the $280 million received this year from the sale of our remaining interest in Stateline was treated as an investing cash flow and is not reflected in the operating cash flow for the year. In addition, we largely constructed multiple projects this year, such as Moapa and the first phase of California Flats, but received only a partial payment on Moapa. We exited the year with a stronger balance sheet and cash position as we've ever had and are well positioned for our Series 6 transition. I'll next discuss updates to our full-year 2017 guidance on slide 15. Before delving into the details, there are certain key assumptions underlying our guidance to keep in mind. Firstly, we're likely to early adopt the new revenue standard in Q1 2017, which provides guidance on recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. As it relates to our 2017 net sales guidance, the new revenue standard is not expected to have a significant impact. However, as in the past, the final structuring of project sales can impact our outlook. Secondly, we made significant progress in the sale of our Moapa project with the recent closing of the tax equity sale. Additionally, an agreement to sell the cash equity from the project has been signed with final closing expected in March upon receipts of third-party approvals. Based on the final structuring of the Moapa transaction, the sales will be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement. Accordingly, we now expect to recognize the full revenue on the project, which adds approximate $0.3 billion to our guidance range. As we've indicated in the past, the structuring of project sales can result in different accounting outcomes. Due to the uncertainty of the final deal structure, our guidance provided last November did not include the full amount of revenue, but did include the full gross margin. Therefore, this guidance change results in increased revenue without any increased gross margin. Thirdly, as it relates to our California Flats project, we anticipate selling the project this year, but the timing is uncertain. The transaction structuring has been driven with the aim of providing a residual interest to be offered to 8point3, which is added to the deal complexity. Maintaining a residual interest to 8point3 continues to be our aim, but given market uncertainty around potential implications of tax reform, the deal is taking longer than usual to structure. Turning now to our updated guidance ranges, note first that on a non-GAAP basis, we're not making any changes to our ending earnings per share expectations. Our new net sales range, adjusted for the Moapa transaction structuring, is $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. As a result of the increased revenue and no incremental margin dollars, the gross margin percentage range has been updated to 11% to 13%. Non-GAAP EPS remained unchanged at breakeven to $0.50. In terms of the quarterly distribution on non-GAAP earnings in 2017, we expect a loss of $0.10 to $0.15 in the first quarter of 2017 and to be in an overall loss position in the first half of 2017 with earnings weighted towards the second half of the year. Key drivers of the first quarter loss position include lower module shipments in the first half versus second half of the year, as well as a higher mix of systems revenue and gross margin expected in the second half of the year. Also note that despite being in a loss position, the Q1 loss per share includes an assumed tax expense due to the jurisdictional mix of income. Turning next to our GAAP operating guidance, the range has been revised to $335 million to $380 million, which includes $55 million to $80 million of cash restructuring-related charges. The range includes $40 million to $60 million of charges related to the cancelation of our Series 5 operations, the timing of which was originally anticipated in 2016. In addition, we've revised the range for expected severance and other charges to $15 million to $20 million, reflecting revised timing of charges originally expected in 2018. As a result of the updated operating expense, we've revised our expected operating income range to a loss of $40 million up to $25 million of income. The revised net loss per share range of $0.80 to $0.05. Turning to balance sheet, we're maintaining our ending expected net cash balance range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. Although our ending 2016 net cash came in above our guidance, this was primarily a result of higher-than-guided operating cash flow in 2016 as certain payments and receipts came in ahead of expected schedule. We expect this to reverse out in 2017 operating cash flow. And for this reason, our expectation for net cash at the end of 2017 is unchanged. The impact of the previously mentioned timing of receipts and payments results in lower operating cash flow expectations for this year. As a result, we are revising the range to $250 million to $350 million from the prior range of $550 million to $650 million. And capital expenditures and shipments remain unchanged from the prior ranges provided. I'll summarize our progress in the fourth quarter and full-year 2016 on slide 16. We had strong financial results for the year with net sales of $3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $5.17, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Our ending cash was nearly $2 billion with $1.8 billion of net cash. For 2017, we're maintaining our non-GAAP EPS of zero to $0.50. Our module efficiency for the year and for Q4 was impressive with a full fleet average of 16.4% and 16.6%, respectively. Our best line efficiency exited the year running at 16.9%. And lastly, our 2016 bookings total was 1.8 gigawatts and we booked over 400 megawatts thus far in 2017. With 2.2 gigawatts of mid-to-late stage opportunities, we'll continue to have healthy bookings prospects. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Well, thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. I just want to check on Moapa. The $300 million in revenues that have been added in, is not actually a change to the economics, it's just merely an accounting adjustment as a function of how you've negotiated the tax equity arrangement. And then I've got a quick follow-up. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, that's right. So, there's no change to the economics. It's just an accounting change due to transactions, tax equity and cash equity now recognize both together. So, it just creates higher revenue, but doesn't change the overall economics. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. And then the 2017 guidance, back-end loaded year. Can you just give us a little bit of color behind that? What gives you the confidence in the second half ramp? And whether the gross margins will be sort of constant or whether they inflect as well? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take, I guess, on the guidance side. So, Paul, I think one of the things that we will highlight is that the bookings momentum that we're starting to see now, and again as we highlighted in the prepared remarks that, there was a period of time that we were practically out of price position, doing a little bit of price discovery in the marketplace to really understand where the market clearing price was going to be. I mean, it was a very significant disruptive decline in module ASPs and starting in July. And what that did is, is resulted in lower bookings momentum really through towards the latter half of 2016. And we've seen significant momentum moving forward, we just recently booked since the beginning of this year over 400 megawatts. And so, what that means is, this going to position a lot more volume, the module shipment volumes that we had anticipated is going to be positioned towards the second half of the year. So, part of it is that. The other piece is, is that, the current profile of the timing of the revenue recognition on our systems business will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. So, I have confidence in terms of our profile from the standpoint of the book business that we have right now. We have a very strong booked module volume at this point in time, given that what we've now been able to book over the last, call it, four, five months, plus what we have contracted now for the systems business and where we are and in that side of the house, we feel very confident with. Now, all that what I would say is, the wildcard that could influence that will still end up being the sell down of our systems business. We're largely on our way with our Playa negotiations right now on our switch project. CA Flats, we're still moving forward with that. And so, the timing of that could impact the second half volume ramp that we're anticipating, but again that is just a movement of an economics that could shift from third and fourth quarter or potentially fall into the beginning of 2018, but as always said, the system business can be little lumpy. It doesn't impact overall economics, it's just timing associated with that. And like I said, is there some risk to that, but other than that, we feel highly confident with the balance of the year forecast. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a couple. I guess, first, Mark, on Tribal Solar, SCE was already a PPA owner. So, wondering if you guys had done any work on trying to re-strike that PPA. And then, if you look at the list, there's 650-or-so megawatts of other SCE projects for 2018 to 2020. So, any update you can provide on the status of those, any of those maybe potentially having similar risk to what you saw with Tribal Solar. And then, I had a follow-up. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, we were in active and ongoing discussions with SCE as it relates to Tribal Solar. The issue is not with SCE. The issue is ultimately with the tribe and their desire for completion of the project on tribal land. Initially, they granted the option and their consent for the construction of the project on their reservation. Because of cultural issues and evolution of changes of certain leaders within the tribe and momentum from the balance of the constituents, there was a change in the support for the project. We tried to resolve those issues. We could not successfully do that. We had also had incurred a relatively small increase to the original cap on the network upgrades. We effectively used that. Given we were unsuccessful in our ability to influence the tribe to support the project, and without their support, we would not be able to complete the project. We effectively use that provision under the cap of the interconnection agreement effectively or the upgrade to the network to result in a termination of the PPA. It's a unique situation. We don't have any other similar situations. We've done other projects with, for example our Moapa project was on tribal land. We had no issues working in with the tribe, the Moapa tribe. The current situation that we had there was more of a challenging environment, and it resulted in unfortunately the termination of that PPA. The balance of the projects that we have with SCE, none of them are on tribal land, and we have full commitment and support with SCE for those projects. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Just a second question, and I guess a little bit similarly on Barilla. Maybe a question on timing. Why write it down now? It's been, my understanding, operating for some time in the current low power pricing environment. So, would just be curious on why it wasn't written down sooner. Thank you. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, Brian, I mean, we've been following the project and we've now, we feel, got enough operational data to make a better determination of long-term prospects for the project. So, Barilla was originally developed to penetrate the Texas market and to be a test like for new technologies. We constructed it with lower bin module, so we had a higher installed cost there than we might otherwise have had, and it's given us some benefits around our ability to win the East Pecos deal, and launch of our 1,500-volt architecture. But we looked at it now and based on where we see declining spot pricing at the moment and given the recent operational edge, we felt now is the right time to write that down. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I think in the accounting world, Brian, you may know, I mean, there's obviously the triggering events. And one of them is, do you have a potential impairment and is that impairment other than temporary, right. And even though there was indications through there are the operations of the asset, at that point in time, it was unclear whether or not the potential risk of an impairment was going to be permanent in nature, and what has ended up happening given where the current power prices are and how we see that evolving in the near-term, it trigged an event that says, yes, now we believe that the impairment is other than temporary. It also is, as Alex indicated is that, we did use low bin modules. This was really was viewed more as an R&D in endeavor, and to use that as an opportunity to continue to test new products and whether it's modules, whether it's inverters, whether it's other components within the architecture, we'll continue to use that site for that. So, there inherently will be value there. So, I look at this as, it's mainly just it's an accounting item. We'll continue to sell the power that's being generated off that asset, but from a book value standpoint, we had to write it down. Operator : And our next question comes from Tyler Frank with Robert Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking that question. Can you talk a little bit more about the overall marketplace? You made some comments that you were out of position in terms of pricing in the back half of last year. So, what sort of adjustments did you have to do in order to start getting bookings in the first half? And should we expect modular sales to have extremely low margins based on the current market pricing? And how should we think about each individual market in terms of ASPs currently? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: First off, as it relates to each market on an ASP basis, I would argue that the relative baseline of crystalline silicon prices relatively consistent globally. But again, where we can capture better value is selling into markets where we have an inherent energy advantage and capture the value of that energy that's being generated and we can price at a premium. So, if you look at the bookings that we've recognized this quarter, I would say, there's a number of them, module-only sales that we were able to capture reasonably meaningful premium to where crystalline silicon is pricing at this point in time, because we've sold the products into geographies where there is inherent energy advantage and we capture that. When you saw the module pricing decline as rapidly as we did and starting in July, I think it's very prudent to go and continue to test it and to see where the prices are starting to settle out at. We have started to see prices settle a little bit. They seem to be in a relatively consistent range when we think about not only within the U.S., but globally. And so, we've just adjusted to that market pricing and we're continuing to go on and sell the value of the energy and we've been successful in doing that and starting to show up in our bookings. Now, granted, yes, with the margin that we're realizing on the Series 4 product be at a lower margin than we would look to as a long-term entitlement, clearly it should, because as we've highlighted, the reason we're transitioning into Series 6 is because of the smaller form factor of Series 4, which in different regions of the world can result in a BoS penalty that could be in the range of $0.06 to $0.08. So, that's a meaningful delta, plus Series 6 comes at a much lower cost profile. And as we highlighted in our last call that Series 6 will have a profile that's in the range of 40% lower than Series 4. So, when you capture the energy yield advantage, slightly higher efficiency product in Series 6 versus Series 4 at a much lower cost profile. Well, yes, it's a very challenging market, having a Series 6 product in this market environment, we couldn't be better positioned. Operator : And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I just want to follow-up on one of your comments you mentioned on the module pricing. You said it's stabilized. Do you feel like the module pricing for the industry is bottoming out, or do you think there's another leg down? And then, a follow-up on the cost profile, Series 4 versus Series 6. If I remember right, Series 4 had about $0.07 per watt of depreciation cost. What do you think it's going to be for Series 6? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So, look, I think the relative stability of the market is always going to be determined by supply and demand. And there's obviously triggering events similar to what we saw in the 2016, whereas it relates to the second half of 2016 where there was a pretty significant disruption of demand, primarily because of tremendous build out of solar in the first half of 2016 in China. That risk profile will exist on a perpetual basis. Whenever we get into an imbalance of supply, demand to the extent a particular geography that is a meaningful component of the overall global demand perspective, starts to see a shift or a decline, then they always are going to be subject to these volatile times, and ASPs can change very quickly. What we're seeing right now is a relatively stable environment, but it could change very quickly similar to what it did in 2016. So, we'll have to keep a watch on that. And what we have said before, our assumption in long term is that this perpetual oversupply will exist, that our competitors will continue to sell at or below cash costs in order to run their factories as efficiently as possible. And we just have to create a product platform, which is why we're transitioning to Series 6 that will enable us sustain that very challenging market environment; sell the value of the energy, capture the cost entitlement of the product and compete in, even though what some would argue, is an unsustainable market environment. It may be for some of our crystalline silicon competitors, but we need to create a business model that can sustain that type of environment. As it relates to the depreciation for Series 6 versus Series 4, I'll let Alex take that question. So, anyway, I guess, Alex didn't hear the entire question. So, on Series 6, the depreciation, you could look at it from the standpoint of the CapEx is approximately half of Series 4. So, from a greenfield standpoint, and given that we are actually doing a brownfield expansion for Series 6, we're going to see a lower depreciation expense. We haven't given the exact number, but you can envision that it will be at a lower CapEx \u2013 or depreciation expense, excuse me, than the Series 4 product, just largely because the CapEx per watt is lower. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, Krish. Apologies for not hearing that, but if you look to the numbers we gave in the guidance call we gave in November, we guided to a CapEx per watt there. And you can look at that relative to the numbers we've given historically around Series 4, and look at those two in find a relative number on depreciation. Operator : And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, just on the systems business. Some of the challenges that you're hearing and seeing in the marketplace today with respect to the corporate tax reform, how is that impacting or could impact margins in the second half of the year? Is that incorporated in your guidance? And as we think about Series 6, I know you had said low- to mid-$0.20 per watt cost targets. It looks like your CapEx is better than what you were planning before. So, are we looking at the low $0.20s as a range for your Series 6 cost target? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the Series 6 cost and I'll let Alex take the tax administration discussion. So, yes, I mean, we're very happy with where we're trending right now from a CapEx perspective. As you would envision, there are many, many different variables that ultimately are going to impact the final cost profile for Series 6. Throughput yield will impact that as well. A lot of things that we have to continue to move forward. We're very encouraged with what we're seeing so far, and obviously having a lower CapEx per watt is obviously a very good indicator of the opportunity set. I would say the challenge that we have right now, the one that we need to stay as aggressively focused on as possible for Series 6 is really going to be our bill of material cost. So, we need to continue to drive down our bill of material cost. We have our roadmap to make that happen. There is a lot of work, though, to ensure that we can get there. And we're going to have to work aggressively in leveraging and negotiating and partnering with our suppliers to ensure that we can do that. So, encouraged by the CapEx early indications, but obviously a long way to go to actually achieve and potentially even do better than our expectations around the Series 6 cost profile. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: And, Krish (sic) [Vishal], as it relates to tax, so I mean, firstly, our guidance today is based on current tax policy, and assumes no changes to that. If you look at it on a project level, the two key drivers to value there are going to be ITC and depreciation. On the ITC side, I think it's unlikely we'll see any change. If you look at the last time the extension came through, it was supported strongly on a bipartisan basis for that extension. Renewables has been responsible for a pretty significant job creation and it already has a finite term. So, if you look at history around tax credit elimination, normally you see a transition period. So, we would expect that there'll be no change to the current ITC schedule. On the depreciation on makers side, who knows what that change will be. It's hard to estimate, but we expect any change there would be offset by a corresponding change in tax rates. What I will say from a structuring perspective is that the uncertainty does create some challenges. There are players in the market who are still open to doing business. So, we don't see an issue with getting tax equity on deals, but there may be changes to the amount of tax equity going into deal to the structures and perhaps to the risk profile the tax equity is looking at in the short term. But we don't see any issue with raising tax capacity, tax capital at the moment. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I think your question around our guidance, and I think Alex mentioned this in the prepared remarks in the script, our guidance assumes there is no change. It's just too speculative at this point in time to make any significant assumptions as what could happen. Way too many moving pieces, so we're assuming that effectively all the components whether it's the ITC, whether it's the depreciation, interest expense deductibility, we're assuming all that stays as is. Operator : And our next question will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. And our last call will come from Philip Shen. Go ahead, please. Again, Philip Shen, your line is open, please go ahead with your question. Once again, Philip Shen, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Sure, sure, we will. Our next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much. Guys, as we think about the cadence of bookings as we go through the balance of 2017 into 2018, when do you start really focusing on the Series 6 product and building a backlog for that besides your own project backlog? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, I mean, it's a good question. It's one of the things that we highlighted. So, today, we spent a lot of time talking through the product readiness and what we're doing in that regard. The next call, Q1, we'll talk more from a market readiness standpoint, and there is a lot that needs to be done in that regard, right, in terms of understanding the spec, developing what we refer to as a PAN file that ultimately is used to do the energy prediction. There's engagement with independent engineers, right, that they have to be involved with as well, so they can help provide kind of that third-party voice to our customers, and as it relates to the product and its performance and quality standards and everything else. So, there is a lot that we need to do. What I will tell you is that there's been a tremendous response so far from our customers. Actually, I was talking with one of them yesterday as well and everyone wants to be a launch for Series 6. Now, the way we've described it to a lot of our customers is, the vast majority. And if you look at our, what we'll report in our 10-K, which will be filed tonight and be available tomorrow, we're going to show close to 2 gigawatts of projects in our contracted pipeline. Now, some of that is near-term, some of that will be Series 4, but really, easily can look at that pipeline and there's going to be north of 1-gigawatt on a DC basis of opportunities for Series 6, given the timeline of those projects. The second half of 2018, we'll be producing 1-gigawatt of Series 6. So, the early production will go to our own projects. So, we're really talking about having the opportunity to sell through Series 6 starting in the 2019 timeframe. Now, module-only activity in bids aren't really happening today per se out in that horizon. Some markets, yes; for the vast majority, no. Development opportunities will start to happen out in that horizon. So, we can use that Series 6 and the leverage of Series 6 to bid into development assets as well in a longer dated horizon. So, we do expect and we do have pipeline. We highlighted in today's call, we've got at least in mid-to-late stage negotiations about 500 megawatts right now of Series 6. That all should drive momentum. Hopefully, we'll realize in some of those bookings as we progress throughout the year, but the pipeline will continue to build. We'll start to see bookings for Series 6 in the second half of the year, but we clearly would expect a much stronger activity around confirmed bookings for Series 6 as we get into 2018. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today. Have a wonderful day.",

Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Arthur Su - Needham & Company, LLC Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2017 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update, then Alex will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call today. I'll begin by briefly reviewing our results for the first quarter, before providing an update on our Series 6 progress and developments in our business. Our first quarter results were a good start to the year with the sale of our Moapa project closing and receipt of the remaining cash from the transaction. Our non-GAAP EPS of $0.25 was above our guidance, which is a noteworthy accomplishment in a very challenging market environment. We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in net cash, which further differentiates the strength of our balance sheet from our competitors, as we remain true to our balanced business model philosophy of growth, profitability and liquidity. Alex will provide more color on our financial results later in his remarks. As indicated on our last earnings call, we are carefully planning all aspects of the Series 6 launch to ensure both technological and commercial readiness. On our last call, we focused on the technology. Today, we will provide an update on our commercial preparation to ensure a successful market launch of our Series 6 product. Keep in mind that with over 17 gigawatts of modules produced, First Solar's technology is well understood and has been installed in projects worldwide. Our customers have trust in our technology, product quality and financial strength. However, given the change in the module form factor, as we move to Series 6, we are making the necessary preparations to ensure a smooth product launch. Turning to slide 4. I'll discuss some of our commercial readiness efforts. Firstly, as it relates to enabling the ecosystem around Series 6, our primary goal is to ensure our cost-effective compatibility with our customers preferred structure providers. Since we made the decision last year to accelerate our Series 6 product, we have been collaborating with leading domestic and global structure providers, EPC contractors and PV engineering firms to evaluate and optimize the Series 6 mounting interface for a wide variety of applications. The learnings from this collaboration, coupled with the module height that is the same as the 72 cell crystalline silicon module and a module frame that facilitates rapid installation gives us confidence in the competitive installation cost of our Series 6 product. We've also been evaluating the mechanical design and installation features of our Series 6 models at our Mesa, Arizona test site, where we've installed more than half a dozen structures from leading suppliers. A third-party contractor has completed trial installations of Series 6 prototypes and the various structure types, including side-by-side trials with competing 72 cell crystalline silicon modes. We've been careful analyzing various installation means and methods focused on optimizing installation velocity and minimizing labor hours. The initial results from this work are very positive and indicate that Series 6 is compatible with existing leading structure designs and can be expected to have favorable installation hours per megawatt installed versus 72 cell crystalline silicon models. Beyond our efforts to ensure a seamless mechanical integration of Series 6, we're also validating the electrical BOS design elements. We have been carefully listing to the voice of our ecosystem partners, understanding their needs and incorporating their feedback to ensure the most efficient designs at a lowest possible cost. To validate our internal electrical BOS analysis and testing, we've engaged two independent engineering firms to provide their assessment of the expected cost of Series 6 electrical BOS components and associated labor. In both case, the independent analysis supports our internal projections. The analysis also supports our belief that due to a shorter string length, Series 6 provides greater layout optimization and siting flexibility. In addition to our own analysis, third-party EPCs and customers have been viewing Series 6 installation demonstrations at the Mesa test site as they develop their own assessment of the installation process and costs. EPC have also begun conducting their own installation trials at the Mesa site to gain hands-on experience and increased familiarity with Series 6. Based on their evaluation and analysis, several EPCs have already provided quotes that further support that Series 6 BOS cost is expected to be similar to or better than competing crystalline silicon products. Over the next few months, we're expanding these trials to several international locations, which will provide greater access to international EPCs and will help ensure that Series 6 is supported by a cost-efficient, mechanical, electrical and EPC ecosystem in all key global markets. As highlighted on slide 5, engaging directly with our customers to both educate them on Series 6 and to solicit their feedback on the product is among our highest priorities. With these objectives in mind, we have recently hosted more than 100 of our customers at a conference in Arizona that included attendance from leading IPPs, developers, utilities, EPCs and ecosystem partners. Customers will provide an early product information and have the opportunity to attend demonstrations of Series 6 module prototype installations. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive with over 95% of our customers indicating they were likely to purchase Series 6. These are positive first steps, and while there's still more work to be done, especially internationally, we are pleased with how Series 6 has been embraced by our customers. In short, the testing performed with our ecosystem partners and voice of the customer feedback received have reinforced our view that Series 6 eliminates the balance of system cost disadvantages associated with our smaller form factors Series 4 module. Our module technology will now be able to leverage its advantaged attributes, including superior temperature coefficient and spectral response unencumbered by higher balance of system cost. Turning to slide six, I'll provide a brief update on our Series 6 technology and manufacturing milestones. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the progress we are making on the Series 6 technology and manufacturing platform. Since our last earnings call, we have ramped down production on eight lines or approximately one-third of our Series 4 manufacturing out of Malaysia factory. This timing aligns with the milestones that we've provided in our February call. The space is undergoing preparation for the delivery of Series 6 equipment, which is scheduled later this year. In addition, we now have all of the production tools ordered for Ohio in our first Malaysia factory. Over the next major \u2013 our next major milestone, the arrival in the third quarter of 2017 of our first tools to our Ohio factory remains on track. We will provide further updates on our Q2 earnings call. Turning to slide seven, I'll provide an update on our future expected module shipments. From the time of our last earnings call, approximately nine weeks ago, we have booked over 100 megawatts of third-party module sales, bringing our total year-to-date bookings to nearly 600 megawatts DC. The geographical mix of our recent module bookings is primarily Asia Pacific and Europe. After deducting year-to-date shipments through March of approximately 400 megawatts, our remaining expected shipments now stand at 3 gigawatts DC. On slide eight, we've provided an updated view of our remaining Series 4 supply. As indicated previously, our remaining Series 4 supply will range between 3.6 and 3.8 gigawatts depending on when we see Series 4 production at our Ohio plant. We will continue to evaluate this decision over the course of the year. Of the anticipated 3.6 to 3.8 gigawatts of Series 4 supply across 2017 and 2018, we have already shipped approximately 400 megawatts, and we have an additional 1.5 gigawatts of volume on the contract, leaving us with the remaining supply of between 1.7 and 1.9 gigawatts. Relative to the prior quarter and based on updated construction schedules, we have reduced the allocation of Series 4 supply to our own capital development projects by approximately 200 megawatts. This is a result of a shift in module allocation to Series 6 uncertain of our captive projects. This decision is expected to result in meaningful improvement in the overall gross margin of these projects. While the pace of our bookings over the past two months is slower than the start of the year, we are encouraged by the growth in our mid to late-stage bookings opportunities shown on slide nine. Since our last earnings call, bookings opportunity have grown to 3 gigawatts DC, an increase of approximately 800 megawatts. Roughly two-thirds of the total 3 gigawatts of opportunities are for Series 4 shipments. Notably, of the approximately 2 gigawatts of Series 4 opportunities, there are approximately 1 gigawatt of projects that are in late stage negotiations. In some cases, we have signed module supply agreements, but are waiting for other conditions precedent, including project financial close, our letter of credit, before recognizing these bookings. We expect much of this volume to book in the second and third quarter. Given the status of these projects and the other mid- to late-stage opportunities, we feel that we're in a good position to sell through the remaining Series 4 supply. In addition, we have a much larger number of early-stage opportunities not included in this view, which helps increase our confidence. Lastly, as we announced recently, we are evaluating alternatives for the sale of our interest at 8point3. This is a result of several factors. Firstly, in the future, we anticipate selling projects primarily in the U.S. prior to COD. As the solar industry has matured, the impact of project value of selling to FNTP or shortly thereafter versus that COD is de minimis. In fact, in some cases, value is enhanced with an earlier sale as this allows the buyer greater degrees of freedom to optimize the structuring of tax equity and project debt. Secondly, recycling capital more quickly allows us to potentially invest in more project development opportunities. As we do this, we remain focused on our targeted development markets where we see the most opportunity. Finally, we remain focused on Series 6 and prioritizing investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity, which we believe has the potential to provide a high return on invested capital. As we continuously evaluate our business model, these important considerations led us to determination to explore strategic alternatives for the sale of our interest in 8point3. Alex will now provide more detail on our first quarter 2017 financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2017. Alex? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. So beginning on slide 11, I'll touch briefly on the operational results of our Series 4 product in the past quarter. Module production was 712 megawatts DC in the first quarter, a decrease of 6% from the prior quarter due to nearly a full quarter of stopped production on four lines in Ohio that began ramping down late last year to prepare the Series 6 production. Capacity utilization increased to 98% in Q1 versus 92% in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter utilization was lower as it included the four lines that were ramped down. Note that as we ramp down Series 4 production, the utilization metric will be subject to increased fluctuation and therefore, somewhat less meaningful. In part, this is why we introduced the remaining Series 4 supply metric, which provides a more relevant metric during the ramp down. Module conversion efficiency for the full fleet averaged 16.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 10 basis points versus Q4 2016. Conversion efficiency on our best line for the full quarter improved 10 basis points to 16.9% as compared to the prior quarter. Our best line exited the third quarter at over 17%. Continuing to slide 12, I'll review some of the income statement highlights for Q1 2017. In reviewing our income statement results, I'll also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Additionally, we've elected earlier to adopt ASU 2014-09, the new revenue standard, which provides common revenue recognition guidance between GAAP and IFRS. The adoption of the standard generally requires us to recognize revenue and profit from our systems business sales in a more linear fashion in our historical practice. Our previously reported financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this standard adoption and more information is available in our press release and in our pending 10-Q filing. In reviewing our financial results, comparisons to the fourth quarter will reflect any applicable revisions from this change. Net sales were $892 million, an increase of $561 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales resulted primarily from the sale of the Moapa projects with the entire revenue from the project recognized in the quarter. Higher revenue from the Moapa sale was partially offset by $179 million decrease in module sales. The closing of the Moapa sale is a significant milestone given the size and complexity of the project and it's also an important component of our 2017 guidance. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects increased to 92% from 25% in Q4 as a result of the Moapa sale and lower third-party module sales. Gross margin for the first quarter was 9% compared to 2% in the prior quarter. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily a result of project impairment in Q4. To put the Q1 gross margin in context, keep in mind that our prior comments on the Moapa project that was acquired in late-stage development. We, therefore, paid a significant development premium for the project. As a result of this and certain developments and construction challenges specific to the project, the gross margin of the project is not representative of what we would expect from a typical development project sale. The gross margin of our component segment was 26% in Q1 compared to 13% in the prior quarter. The sequential increase here was primarily due to the impact of certain charges associated with our project impairments in Q4. Operating expenses excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges was $72 million in the first quarter versus Q4 adjusted OpEx of $100 million. $28 million sequential decrease as a result of the impact of our previously implemented restructuring actions and also an $8 million decrease in project impairment charges. Restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our Series 6 transition were $20 million in Q1 compared to $729 million in the prior quarter. The charge relates to Series 4 and Series 5 equipments and severance related to the ramp down of certain Series 4 production lines. Excluding restructuring-related items, operating income in the first quarter was $12 million compared to an adjusted operating loss of $90 million in Q4. The increase in adjusted operating income is primarily due to higher sales, lower project impairment charges and a decrease in operating expenses. On a GAAP basis, our operating loss for the quarter was $8 million. Other income for the quarter was $26 million, primarily resulting from the settlement of an outstanding matter with a former customer. The cash associated with the settlement was also received in Q1. We had tax expense of $6 million in the first quarter compared to $56 million of tax expense in Q4. As a reminder, the prior quarter tax expense is significantly higher due to predominantly non-cash tax expense of $196 million, associated with the distribution of approximately $750 million of cash to the U.S. from a foreign subsidiary. The prior quarter tax expense was partially offset by a tax benefit from restructuring charges. First quarter EPS was $0.09 on a GAAP basis and excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.25 on a non-GAAP basis. Relative to our expectations to Q1, EPS was higher due to better-than-expected profit from the Moapa project sale and the timing of a settlement of the former customer, which was not expected in Q1. In addition, this settlement was contemplated on our previous guidance to potentially benefit operating income rather than other income. I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information on slide 13. Our cash and multiple securities balance ended the first quarter at over $2.4 billion, an increase of approximately $491 million from Q4. Our net cash position improved by $402 million to nearly $2.2 billion as we received the final payments for our Moapa and East Pecos project. Our Q1 net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $374 million. The change was primarily due to a net reduction in projects assets and deferred revenue from the sale of the Moapa project. Total debt was $277 million in the first quarter, an increase of $89 million from the prior quarter. The increase mainly resulted from issuing non-recourse project level debt for projects in Japan, India and Australia. Cash flows from operations were $493 million in Q1 versus cash flows from operations of $268 million in the fourth quarter. Free cash flow was $380 million compared to free cash flow of $215 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $113 million compared to $54 million in the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 14, I'll review updated full year 2017 guidance. In terms of assumptions underlying our guidance, as we indicated last quarter, the adoption of new revenue standards not have a significant impact on the net sales range we've already provided. However, as mentioned previously and I've seen with the updates in that sales guidance in our previous call associated with structuring of the Moapa project, the final structuring of project sales later this year may have future impact to our net sales guidance. As it relates to project sales during the remainder of the year, we're pleased with the progress of making the sale of 179 megawatts AC Switch Station Project. We're in advanced stage of the sale process and expect to close the transaction in Q2 or Q3 of this year. The California Flats and Cuyama projects have been offered to 8point3 and are under review by the partnership. If 8point3 is not able to acquire these projects, we anticipate having sufficient third-party demand to sell these projects this year. Turning now to the guidance ranges. As a result of improved visibility in the certain project sales, we are raising our net sales guidance by $50 million to a revised range of $2.85 billion to $2.95 billion. We're raising our gross margin percentage of 150 basis points to a revised range of 12.5% to 14.5% as a result of the improved operational performance, better project sale visibility and as a result of the movement of certain expenses previously forecast as cost of sales, which are now expected to be treated as plant startup costs within operating expense. Our OpEx guidance increased by $40 million for both GAAP and non-GAAP, as a result of the revised plant startup previously mentioned. For GAAP operating expenses, this $40 million increase was partially offset by a $15 million decrease in expected restructuring and asset impairment charges. The revised restructuring range is now $40 million to $65 million, of which $20 million was incurred in the first quarter. The downward revision to the range resulted from ongoing supply negotiations, which reduce the potential remaining liability. We're raising our EPS guidance by $0.25 based on our operational performance and in anticipation of better economic value from certain project sales. Our revised non-GAAP EPS range is now $0.25 to $0.75 and our GAAP EPS range has been revised to a loss of $0.30, up to $0.40 a profit. The change in GAAP EPS is a result both of the fact as leading to the increase in the non-GAAP EPS, combined with lower expected restructuring charges. Note that our guidance includes expected net interest expense of $15 million to $20 million and minimal contribution from equity and earnings. We also anticipate minimal other income or expense for the balance of the year. In terms of a quarterly distribution of our non-GAAP earnings, we currently expect second quarter earnings to be approximately breakeven. However, the timing of the sale of the Switch Station Project, currently forecasted in Q3 could materially increase second quarter earnings. We have previously anticipated a loss in the first half of the year. However, our operational performance including improved module cost per watt and improving outlook for the system sale business have resulted in a change to our outlook. As it relates to our guidance for certain catalyst that may lead us to further raise our EPS expectations for the remainder of the year, including further improved visibility into sales system projects. Additionally, as part of our ongoing tax funding assets, we may record an income tax benefit of up to $55 million (24:06) in the second quarter. As this benefit is still subject to acceptance by tax authorities, we have not yet incorporated this into our guidance and will do so when and to the extent the matter is finalized. Related to our net cash and operating cash flow guidance, our expected ranges of both increased by $100 million. The increase is a combination of higher revenue, improved module cost per watt, improved systems business margins, improved working capital management and lower restructuring charges. I'll now summarize our first quarter 2017 progress on slide 15. We had solid financial results for the quarter. Net sales of $892 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. Our ending cash was over $2.4 billion with $2.2 billion of net cash. We raised the midpoint of our GAAP EPS by nearly $0.50 and our non-GAAP EPS by $0.25. Our Series 4 module efficiency remains solid with a fleet full average of 16.7%, a lead line efficiency of 16.9% in Q1. Our outlook for 2017 bookings is strong, with nearly 600 megawatts booked here to date and mid- to late-stage opportunities of 3 gigawatts. Our Series 6 transition is progressing well, and we're making the necessary preparations to ensure a successful product launch. We have now ordered all of the tools for both our Ohio and Malaysia factories. In addition, the first Series 6 tools are on track to arrive at our Ohio factory in Q3. And lastly, we're pleased with the positive response from our customers and ecosystem partners to the Series 6 products. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : And we will take our first one from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if you assume the 8point3 strategic process results in more capital to deploy, I know that's an assumption at this point, but how should we be thinking about priorities? Are you looking to fast-track Series 6? Do you build more capacity than the current base case or would it be something else? Just trying to get a sense for what the uses of capital would be, and then I have a follow-up. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, so Brian, clearly the liquidity position is strong today. And we've made a strategic decision to maintain both an unlevered balance sheet and a net cash position given cyclicality in the solar industry. The business is in a transition period between Series 4 and Series 6, which is capital-intensive, and we intend to grow that Series 6 capacity from a position of strength. So in terms of how we think about capital, we really look to award full of cash needs and opportunities. So firstly, we fund our operations; secondly, we look to invest in manufacturing capacity that's both the current Series 6 announced capacity and then the ability to grow beyond that as the more opportunity presents. We look to fund the development business, and that includes long-term systems opportunities relative \u2013 that provides incremental returns relative to the module business and relative to the risk-adjusted cost of capital associated with those projects. After that, we look at M&A, and that's post the sale of existing assets, investments, and also opportunities to invest in other growth opportunities, so we continue to look at synergistic M&A opportunities, both around the technology and around project development. And then finally on top of that, we make sure we have an adequate buffer to provide liquidity through cyclicality in the industry volatility. So once you go through all of those, we look to prioritize our capital and see where we can use it. Assuming at that point, we had excess capital which we didn't leave could be accretively deployed in business then we look to return that capital to shareholders. So that's an ongoing analysis. And we'll obviously continue to monitor the capital and liquidity position as we move through the Series 6 transition and through other events this year, including the sale of 8point3 and the systems business sales. The other thing that we take into account is, geographically, about half of our cash sits offshore and is subsequently invested offshore. Should we have any tax reform or anything else that impacts the ability to use that cash, that would obviously play into the calculation as well. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, okay, great, fair enough. Appreciate the color. Second question, I guess, this is, obviously, kind of front-and-center topic. I'm sure there's going to be a number of questions around this. But can you guys speak to the Section 201 request from one of your manufacturing peers in the U.S.? I guess, I'd be curious to know if it's impacting your approach to booking, the remaining Series 4 capacity you outlined? And then with respect to Series 6, and then if your current contracted bookings have any contingencies that would allow for pricing to be recalibrated? And then lastly, with respect to Series 6, how this potentially factors into your thinking around timing, investment and then just the general strategy there? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right, Brian, there's a lot there, so I'll try to \u2013 hopefully I got most of your questions. First off, as it relates to the Tier 1 case, we're obviously very aware of it. We're looking closely at the filing. Clearly, I think the spirit of the reason for the filing is rooted in the fact that there's clearly an oversupply in this industry, and we believe that really is an issue. And we also believe that there is a need for free and fair trade, and there's also a need for enforcement around that. So all that I think provides a undertone of the merits of what the case relates to. As you also know that thin-film is not included. It's not included in the criteria of the basis of what the case is currently structured for, which would exclude not only our production here, obviously, in the U.S., but, obviously, our production outside of the U.S., currently in Malaysia and then ultimately, into Vietnam. As it relates to our strategy, we're going to continue to move forward, we're going to continue to address the market, we're going to continue to provide high value to our customers in the best possible product in the marketplace, whether it's Series 4 or whether it's Series 6. We'll enter into our contracts, a lot of the obligations that are in those contracts, we are not structuring contracts for the most part that would enable some form of a repricing. But if the case were to creates some merit, and if we now have, again, a different view of where the market (30:40) price is for crystalline silicon, that could inform our views a little bit around how we think about our pricing strategy for both Series 4 and Series 6, but that's clearly off into the future. As it relates to our view around manufacturing capacity and where we think about Series 6, our commitments still is the priorities that we talked about before for Perrysburg, then Malaysia and then Vietnam. We've also highlighted though that we have flexibility in the toolset that we're currently installing in Ohio, that could allow us some optionality of increasing capacity of Series 6 in Perrysburg, and we'd look to this maybe as one factor that would inform our decision around that. The other would be, I'd argue that corporate tax rate would be another one that would inform our \u2013 U.S. corporate tax rate would inform our view around adding incremental capacity into our facility in Ohio. So there's a lot of moving pieces we're going to continue to assess and evaluate. And again, I think the whole fundamental issue though that we shall be focused on is, we're very happy with where we are with our launch of Series 6, that's in great position. This trade case or other issues that may arise from it may also inform our view of little bit around how long we continue to produce in Perrysburg. We've highlighted that our current view is we've optionality of maybe pulling a couple of hundred megawatts out, which really is there to facilitate the transition into Series 6 to the extent there is some traction around this case, we may continue to produce that 200 megawatt, maybe not only through 2018, but beyond 2018, if need may be. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Brian, with regards to Series 6 timing, we're already on a pretty aggressive schedule there, so I don't see that changes. As Mark said, we have flexibility around the Series 4 supply to keep that going longer should we need it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hi. Thanks for the questions. As a follow-up on the Section 201 topic. If the Section 201 gets implemented, do you see any changes to your production plans for 2018. For example, would you move to produce either more or less of Series 4 or Series 6 than you had previously indicated? And could you sell the Series 6 externally in 2018 versus prior plans of keeping, I believe, most of it in-house? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Phil, I think I sort of alluded to a little bit in my comments to Brian's question, but it really did \u2013 other than the timing of when we would actually wind down our production of Series 4 in Perrysburg, it really doesn't inform our views beyond that in 2018. Now if the trade case were to get some traction, could we look to continue producing some Series 4 in Perrysburg as an example, potentially? Again, the other thing, but again, it's a longer date of horizon depending on what happens with this case. We have the optionality of adding incremental capacity in Perrysburg if need be. Again, the toolset accommodates production volume that is closer to 1.1 gigawatts versus the currently planned 550 megawatts, so a lot there to be evaluated. But I think we're very early. I mean, obviously, as you know the trade case was just filed here recently. A lot will happen and evolve over the next months and quarters, and as we get a clear picture of what direction it's going, we have options and decisions that will make at that point in time. Operator : And we will take our next question from Krish Sankar of Bank of America. Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, if the California Flats and Moapa projects do get sold to 8point3 or a third party, is that in your forecast for this year? A \u2013 [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: So the Moapa project has already been completed, and that's in the Q1 revenue. The California Flats project is assumed to be sold this year. Now whether it goes to 8point3 or to another third party, it is going to dependent on 8point3's appetite ability to acquire that project. So the partnership and 8point3 is currently reviewing that asset. The indication I would given the capital requirements to acquire that, 8point3 is likely not going to do so. But if that's the case, we're going to sell it to a third party, but the value of that project is in our guidance for the year, timing remains a little uncertain. The other project that is in that perhaps you're thinking of this is a switch project, so that's in our numbers for the year and we're assuming comes in Q3 although there is a chance that could accelerate into Q2. Operator : And our next question comes from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I have two questions. One is can you just clarify the comments you made on production output of Series 6 in 2018? Do you say 550 megawatts or could it be up to a 1 gigawatt of output in 2018? And then as far as the cash balance is concerned, I think you had previously said that your cash distribution is going to -net cash could go down until Q1, Q2 of next year. Is that still the case? Or do you expect cash to improve over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. A \u2013 [06G0M8-E Mark Widmar]>: On the Series 6 production, let makes sure, I'm clear on that, and I'll let Alex to take the cash question. But Series 6 what I had \u2013 what the 550 megawatts represented, 550 megawatts is the fully ramp capacity that we're currently are planning in our Perrysburg facility, all right. And we won't actually start producing in Perrysburg until the middle of next year, so we won't have a full year output from Perrysburg. But in aggregate across Perrysburg, across KLM, for example, our Malaysia facility, we anticipate to have a little bit north of around 1 gigawatts, maybe a little bit north of a gigawatt production of Series 6 in 2018. Again, with that all that production largely happening in the second half of 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yes, on the cash side, so we raised on net cash guidance by $100 million, so $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion for the end of this year, and that's including the CapEx we're planning on spending for the year. So $525 million to $625 million, of which we spent a little over $100 million in the first quarter. So we're on track on the CapEx side. The cash balance for the end of the year will go up slightly relative to previous guidance. We haven't guided to be on that, but we will continue to spend CapEx through to 2018. And as we've mentioned before, 2018, when we started with Series 4 product in Q1 and Q2, it's the time that product is going to be most challenged relative to the competition given that we're no longer investing in the development of Series 4 as we focus on Series 6. So we haven't guided out to a number, but we would expect to continue to spend CapEx all the Series 6 transition through 2018, but we're, obviously, going to end the year with a very robust cash balance, and the cash guidance that number we're giving here through the end of the year doesn't include any proceeds from 8point3. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Hughes of Credit Suisse. Andrew Hughes - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. I had a question on Moapa and guidance and then one of tax equity, if you don't mind. Just on the Moapa result, can you give us a sense of what drove better margins? Was it pricing or more of the internal transfer costs? And then as you look ahead to projects for the rest of the year, I mean, what has improved on the pricing front for you guys? And as a result, might we see a shift in the business mix back more to systems from modules. It seems to be emphasized under Series 6? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So on the Moapa side, we saw a slight uptick on the value. It's not significant, but you got to remember when we're guiding to relatively low EPS numbers this year relative to the past, even small movements in project value can change the overall outlook pretty significantly. When we think about future systems values and we're currently negotiating with the sale of our switch assets, so we have a good sense how the market looks there, and we have had a lot of unsolicited proposals for other assets in our pipeline from very credible counter parties. I think the dynamic you're seeing here are there are few large-scale quality assets in 2017 and also into 2018, and that's leading to very robust demand and better pricing in the market. So we're seeing that dynamics flow through, and that's giving us confidence in the rest of this year in the system side. As it relates to moving back to more development, we've always maintained that we will continue to develop in the U.S. and in select other markets where that makes sense. On a long-term run-rate basis, we would expect to have potentially a gigawatt of development. In the short-term that maybe significantly higher proportion of that as we get through the existing pipeline that we have in the U.S. and internationally in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As we go beyond that, when we grow the Series 6 volume, I would still expect us to expand into more module-only sales as a percentage of the total manufacturing capacity that we have, but we'll continue to monitor systems business and if it makes sense, as we said on the question around cash usage, we're very happy to invest in development if we believe there's accretive return above and beyond the module business adjusted for the risk profile we are taking. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I was wondering (40:09) to get that question and hopefully, we can try to make ourselves clear, but sometimes it keeps coming back to that same view. We've never said that we will not continue to do development. We've always said that we're going to continue to do development. We'll do development in the markets which we believe that we can capture inherent value and that we have core competency and differentiation potentially or capabilities that enables us to get appropriate return on capital and U.S. clearly being one of them. So development is a core part of our strategy. It would be part of the value chain in which we look to participate not only here in the U.S., but in Asia, India, APAC, Japan, those markets will clearly be regions, which we'll continue to focus on. The other thing I want to make sure is also understood is the \u2013 part of the reason here is particularly in the U.S. is we are starting to see more of a market opportunity for utility owned generation. And I still do believe that in the U.S., the ultimate owner of these assets will potentially evolve to be the utilities. And having that capability of providing turnkey solutions and doing development is going to be putting us in a best position to serve our customers' need. And I think it continues to highlight the unique value composition to utility of the First Solar versus alternatives that they may have. So don't think of us looking to exit development. We'll continue the development. We will look to invest where it's appropriate. And I do think it will best position us long-term to be successful in the U.S. market, in particular. Operator : And our next question comes from Tyler Frank of Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about what the current market is like for buyers and utility scale projects, both here in the U.S. and internationally as well as what you're seeing for demand from utilities here in the U.S.? And then shifting gears a bit, when you look at the cost for Series 6, now you've had an opportunity to work on it a little bit more. Can you discuss where that's tracking to your expectations and where you expect the cost profile to get to once you start ramping capacity? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Why don't we \u2013 Alex, why don't you take the market assets with the U.S. international? I'll try to do the demand and the cost discussion. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Sure. I'd say we're seeing very strong demand. As I mentioned before a little bit, there seems to be dearth of quality large assets in the U.S. in 2017 and even going into 2018. And despite some of the uncertainty in the market around potential tax reform, there's still is a strong appetite from tax equity capital providers from debt providers and from cash equity owners. We are seeing broader sways of buyers coming into the market. So historically, we saw tax equity and some infrastructure players only, [along the side the strategics, the yield cos came and went, I'd say we're seeing more interest from infrastructure money and long-term pension money. So the market remains very resilient in the U.S. in the short- and medium-term. Internationally, it's very dependent on the regions that we're in. We have a development business in Japan. I would say that that's one of the more liquid markets from a debt perspective for solar business. So we're very happy with the debt capital that we've been raising for our assets there, and we have yet to sell large-scale assets in Japan, but we are very confident based on the discussions we've been having with buyers that there is going to be significant appetite for long-term contracted assets in Japan, and we expect to realize good margins out of those assets. Now the markets in the world, it's very dependent, but I'd say generally, we're seeing pretty strong demand in every market where we're continuing to develop assets, both on the debt equity side where relevant on the debt side and on the cash equity side. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I think on the demand question around, I think it was specific to more U.S. utilities, if I look at U.S. utilities and again, what's really happening is solar, in particular, is kind of the demand associated with it is essentially solely on the merits of the economics. I mean, demand is \u2013 the of cost of solar has come down so much, and it's competitive and everyone is looking at long-term integrated resource plans and have a movement more towards integration of solar, and a lot of utilities, there's someone at the forefront of their journey around that. I will say though that I did make my comment about utilities trying to rate base, I do think there is an undertone. A lot of utilities are trying to find a profile and an opportunity to rate base the solar assets, and I think that's really \u2013 ultimately, would prefer to do. But I'm not seeing other than utilities in California they're dealing with a number of issues, whether it's the emergence of community choice aggregators and load being pulled away from them or whether it's with the distributed resources such as residential rooftop. They're clearly in a different mindset on how they're thinking about a procurement note, but the vast majority of the other utilities that we're engaging with, I would say, demand is very robust at this point in time. On the cost of Series 6, the one thing I'll reemphasize, I think I said this on the guidance call way back in November is that the towering strength of this company is its people. And we have tremendously talented people, creative, knowledgeable, innovative, and they continue to amaze me and surprise me with their capabilities and where we ultimately can go with this technology. We're very happy with where we are in the timeline and the progression of getting this product commercialized into the market. The reality though is we're not going to stop. When we get the product initially into the market, we're going to continue to drive the efficiency up, the road map is not done. There's still room to grow, and there's still room to drive cost down. And we know that at the end of the day, the technology that will win this marketplace is the highest performing lowest-cost. And we believe we have a platform that can enable that. It creates differentiation and separation relative to our competitors and the journey of where we are at this point in time; I would say we're in a very good position, long ways to go. But I'm not going to commit specifically to the cost profile and the view of where we thought we were going to be. I would just say that I'm very encouraged with the work the team has done and the opportunities that is in front of us. Operator : And our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much, guys. So I have two model questions. So if I look back at the numbers that you're reporting for 2016, both top-line and bottom line, it looks like about $50 million of delta and about $0.28 of EPS is the change, and that's roughly in line with the adjustments in 2017. Is that really what we're seeing here in the 2017 guidance? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: No. So if you go back \u2013 and you'll have to wait till you see the Q, but what you're going to see with the change in the accounting standards is you're going to see significant fluctuation quarterly, but on a cumulative basis, the impact is very limited. So the 2017 opening with same earnings impact with a total of about $6 million. So the delta that you're seeing on the accounting standard change have no impact to change we're giving on the guidance side at the moment. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, so don't think about this as somehow there's a shift from the result of the adoption, the accounting standard had an adverse impact on Q4 and then somehow benefited 2017. That's not the effect. The point that Alex mentioned, the retained earnings impact was small and that was a cumulative impact. We had to go back a number of years to effectively restate under the new accounting standard what the implications would have been, and that was a nominal impact to retained earnings. What's flowing through in the guidance for 2017 is we've indicated is just operational results, better cost per watt and better visibility around valuation for project sales. Operator : And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question guys. In your remarks, you had some language about improvement in the landscape, industry landscape for project economics. And I guess, I would ask, when you say it's getting better, what's the baseline? What are you comparing that to, 2016, a year ago? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: I'd say we're comparing that to how we saw the market at the time we gave our guidance. So when we came out with our original guidance in November last year and then updated in February, we're seeing a significant change in how we are perceiving the value of our assets since that time based on feedback we've been getting from the market, both from the sale of the switch asset and then also from unsolicited process we've had relative to some other projects that we have. So we're basing it on feedback from the market as opposed to when we originally gave guidance when we had perhaps less clarity specific to those discrete assets. Operator : And we will take our final question from Edwin Mok of Needham & Company. Arthur Su - Needham & Company, LLC: Hi everyone. This is actually Arthur on for Edwin. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one is just on the Series 6 transition beyond the initial line in Ohio and the eight lines in Malaysia. Can you give us the initial look at the milestones you have in place for the other production facilities? And then secondly, can you provide an update on any progress in penetrating international markets? I think in the past, you've highlighted Australia and India. Yeah. Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So the transition \u2013 in the last earnings call, and unfortunately, I don't have the slide, so when we talked about there, we had a timeline that actually showed the major milestones in the progression of where we are. What I would say right now is that we now have approval and actually we are in the process now of, again \u2013 Perrysburg has been completely tore down, we're starting to receive some of the tools. The two plants in Malaysia have actually been \u2013 equipment's been removed now in the process of getting ready to receive tools. And then we've actually started momentum now moving into Vietnam. And so we refer to as the first phase is Terra 0 and then Terra 1 (50:38), which is the Plant 5 and 6 in Malaysia and then Terra 2 (50:43) being in Vietnam. And all of that's in progress right now, so we've got three different work streams of activities that were ongoing, which when you aggregate up that capacity across those three that will get us to about 3 gigawatts of production. And then the next phase will be referred to as Terra 3 (51:04), which will give us another 1.1 gigawatts or so of production, and that's really should be largely running up at least on a run-rate basis as we get through the end of 2018, beginning of 2019, we'll be on that kind of run rate across that platform of those two \u2013 of those Terra 0, 1, 2 and ultimately Terra 3 (51:20). So we feel good about it. And there's a timeline we had in the last earnings call, maybe to give you a little bit more color from the standpoint. The international markets continue to be very robust and there's continuing engagement with us. The one thing I will say though is that we are capacity constrained right now around Series 4 and as it relates to some of that demand profile that we're seeing in the international markets, they're looking for module shipments that would happen later this year into the first half of 2018. And so as it relates to having limited module supply, that constraints a little bit to engage in some of those discussions. And then the first half of the \u2013 the second half of 2018, the production that will produce Series 6 largely is going to be allocated to our own development assets. So we're really looking at a timeline of getting out into 2019 before we really have a lot of supply that we can engage the market with, and then particularly address some of the international market opportunities. But what I'll say is that we are almost always kind of a supplier of choice and when there's an opportunity where ever it is, whether it's domestic or international, we're generally giving an opportunity to address those market potentials, especially in markets where we have a good \u2013 an advantage or a temperature co efficiency, factor respond, hot humid climates, particular. There's clearly a poll for our technology. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Chirag Odhav - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management) Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2017 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update, then Alex will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2017. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Our operational and financial results for the second quarter were resilient and market demand for our technology continues to be robust. We've had a number of highlights since our last earnings call, including the arrival of our first Series 6 equipment at our factory in Ohio, record quarterly shipments of nearly 900 Megawatt DC and strong bookings of 1.5 Gigawatt DC. In addition, our financial results for the quarter were solid, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 and an ending net cash balance of $1.9 billion. The sale of Switch Station and higher module sales to third parties were important contributors to the quarterly results. As a result of our first-half performance, improved visibility into systems project sales and an increase in expected shipments, we have raised our full year 2017 net sales, EPS, operating cash flow and net cash guidance. Entering 2017, we knew it would be a challenging year for us with the uncertainty of the global supply-demand balance and our product transition to Series 6. Despite these challenges, we have made great progress in the first half of this year. Firstly, following the receipt of a waiver under the ROFO agreement with 8point3 for interest in the Switch Station project, we were able to leverage the continued vigorous market demand for our high-quality systems projects and selling interest in Switch Station at a significantly higher valuation versus selling to 8point3. We also received waivers of our California Flats and Cuyama projects, and similarly, given current market indications, we expect to realize considerably higher valuations for those projects. Secondly, we have been very successful realizing the energy advantage of selling through most of our remaining anticipated supply of our Series 4 product. Lastly, we've made great strides with the product and commercial readiness of our Series 6 product. While there are still many challenges ahead, we are pleased with our progress over the first half of 2017, and we'll continue in the future to apply the same disciplined approach balancing growth, liquidity and profitability that we believe provides our shareholders the greatest long-term value. Turning to Slide 4, I'll discuss our bookings since our last earnings call. In total, we have booked 1.5 Gigawatt DC in the past three months, bringing our year-to-date bookings to approximately 2.1 Gigawatt DC. After deducting year-to-date shipments through June of approximately 1.2 Gigawatt DC, our remaining expected shipments are 3.7 Gigawatt DC. Our 1.5 Gigawatt of bookings were geographically diversified in the quarter with the strongest results in the U.S., India, Asia-Pacific and Europe. We also booked new volumes in both Latin America and Africa. The strong quarterly bookings and increase in our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunity, which I will highlight in my comments later, are the result of several factors. First and foremost, the increasing affordability of solar continues to be a fundamental driver of global demand. We continue to see substantial demand in established markets and the emergence of new markets with significant growth potential. In order to capitalize on the growth of the global solar market, we began investing in international sales teams several years ago. We've also entered into strategic partnerships which allow us to serve markets where we do not have a physical presence. The bookings for the quarter are the result of these multi-year strategies to focus on sustainable markets and develop long-term relationships with key customers. Certain developments in domestic and international markets, including demand \u2013 strong demand in China, especially for Tier 1 and high efficiency products as well as the Section 201 case in the U.S., have created an acceleration of procurement timing among customers. While neither serve to change the underlying fundamental demand in the global market, both have impacted near-term module availability. Both have also served to firm-up module pricing in the near term. However in the long term, and for as long as the global module supply-demand imbalance exist, we expect the global market demand to remain aggressive. For this reason, we remain focused on executing a successful transition to Series 6, which is expected to provide us with the most competitively differentiated product. Relative to the regional highlights for the recent bookings, the United States was our strongest market for bookings with new module volume of over 1 Gigawatt DC. Demand was highly diversified with projects in California, the desert Southwest and the Southeast. The largest of the bookings was an agreement to supply modules to the 328 Megawatt DC Mount Signal project in California. Demand in India was strong in Q2. We booked over 350 Megawatt DC of module supply agreement. The booking strength was a result of both our strong energy advantage in this region and key customer relationships that we have developed over the past several years. By working with established customers who have experienced the benefits that our modules bring in India, we are able to maximize the realized value of additional energy that our modules provide. Our bookings in Asia-Pacific were diversified across more than seven countries, highlighted by an additional 41 Megawatt DC of project bookings in Japan, majority of which will utilize Series 6 modules. This brings our contracted portfolio of systems projects in Japan to over 220 Megawatt DC, with an even larger number of potential bookings opportunities. In China, we booked approximately 60 Megawatt DC of module supply agreements since the beginning of the year, which represents our first substantial volume supplied to this market. In Europe, our bookings this past quarter were primarily in Turkey as a result of our partnership agreement with Zorlu. In France, we continued to secure additional module supply agreements under the most recent tender process. Now turning to Slide 5, I'll provide an update on our remaining Series 4 supply. Our anticipated Series 4 supply across 2017 and 2018 remains between 3.6 Gigawatts and 3.8 Gigawatts, depending on when we see Series 4 production at our Ohio plant. With 1.2 Gigawatt DC of volume shipped through the end of June, and combined project and module bookings of 2.1 Gigawatt DC, we have a remaining Series 4 supply of between 300 Megawatt DC and 500 Megawatt DC. Entering the year, our goal was to sell the majority of our remaining Series 4 supply by mid-year. With our recent bookings momentum, we have largely been able to achieve that objective. With our transition to Series 6, we see the sell-through of our remaining Series 4 supply as positive. However, we're also aware of the significant customer demand remaining in the market and our focus on meeting our customers' needs. For that reason, we are evaluating our options that would provide flexibility to extend Series 4 production beyond the current anticipated shutdown schedule, while not impacting our planned rollout of Series 6. We're still in the evaluation stage. And if any decisions are made, which will be driven by visibility to secured and contracted demand, updated plans will be communicated at the appropriate time. In addition to strong bookings in the quarter, we've also seen a significant increase in our mid-to-late stage booking opportunities as shown on Slide 6. Note this metric includes all of our advanced opportunities which shipping dates that extend over the next several years. Since our first quarter earnings call, bookings opportunities have grown to 8 Gigawatt DC, a substantial increase of 5 Gigawatts. The increase in opportunities is a meaningful accomplishment given the strong Q2 bookings of 1.5 Gigawatts, the vast majority of which were included in the Q1 mid-to-late stage opportunities of 3 Gigawatts. The increase in potential bookings highlights a couple of important trends. Firstly, we continue to see strong demand of our Series 4 product which gives us confidence in our ability to sell through our remaining supply. Secondly, this points to the fact that our efforts to prepare the market for our Series 6 product launch is beginning to bear fruit as a substantial portion of the total opportunities presented are for Series 6 module deliveries. During our last two earnings call, we focused in detail on ongoing efforts to work with ecosystem partners and customers to ensure a seamless acceptance of Series 6. While these efforts are ongoing, this is an indication that we're beginning to see the impact of this engagement. It's also important to recognize that 1.9 Gigawatt of these mid- to late-stage projects are potential systems project booking. Year-to-date, the vast majority of our bookings have been third-party module sales utilizing our Series 4 product, but this was expected due to the focus on selling out Series 4 by mid-year, and, more importantly, the relatively longer selling cycle of development opportunities. The higher third-party module bookings does not mean there's any change in our view around project \u2013 future project development opportunity. If you take our contracted systems pipeline with CODs over 2018 and into 2020 timeframe, plus the 1.9 Gigawatts of potential bookings mentioned, this comes to a potential combined systems business annual average of approximately 950 Megawatts. This estimate does not take into account any opportunities from our much larger earlier stage development project opportunities, which are not included in our view on Slide 6, but could be converted into bookings. We are actively continuing to evaluate \u2013 we are also actively continuing to evaluate opportunities globally to acquire development assets or pipelines. Putting these pieces together and consistent with our previous long-term indications, we continue to have visibility to maintain a systems business of approximately 1 Gigawatt per year. The underlying demand drivers for project development opportunities in the United States and selected international markets such as Japan and Australia are very encouraging. For example, in the U.S., over the past year alone, we have observed a greater than 50% increase in utilities' stated plans to deploy solar as part of their targeted resource mix. We estimate that over the next four years, this represents a greater than 10 Gigawatt opportunity for solar. It is important to note that this is fundamentally driven by economics and not solely by renewable or solar-specific mandate. The decision to install solar has moved from a political mandate to an economic decision. Additionally, further acceptance of solar is being enabled by utilities' increasing awareness of the capabilities of utility-scale solar to contribute to grid stability and reliability. We feel we are well-positioned with utility customers and to be a trusted partner as they add increasing amounts of solar resources in the upcoming years. Likewise, corporate customers are an increasingly important source of utility-scale solar demand as they look for ways to hedge their energy costs and improve their band. Our multi Gigawatt portfolio of development and module supply opportunities with corporate customers continues to grow. And notably, we now have over 800 Megawatts of projects where we have been short listed. With both our Switch Station and California Flats project, we have already demonstrated the ability to meet the needs for large-scale off-site renewables. Our financial strength and ability to provide integrated solutions, enhanced by our Series 6 module, uniquely positions us to meet the needs of this growing market segment. Continuing on to Slide 7, I'll provide an update on our Series 6 transition. We are encouraged with our progress thus far in meeting the key milestones we have provided at the beginning of this year. Through the first half of this year, we are on track and, in some cases, ahead of targets provided. Since our last update we reached a major milestone with the arrival of our first Series 6 equipment at our Ohio factory. As shown on Slide 8, our first vapor transport deposition coater has arrived on-site and is in the process of being installed. Additional equipment is being validated at our supplier sites and continues to arrive in Perrysburg as scheduled. We are steadily moving forward in assembling the front end of the line, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. We are also targeting our first complete module off the production line by the end of 2017 or early 2018. In regards to our Series 6 factory in Malaysia, as we've mentioned during last quarter's call, we stopped productions on eight lines of Series 4 manufacturing at the beginning of April. All major production tools have been ordered for this location, and we expect the first tool to arrive in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition to our efforts in Ohio and Malaysia, we are preparing our existing, but never equipped, Vietnam factory for Series 6 production. Moving to Vietnam versus Malaysia for our third Series 6 factory provides two benefits. Firstly, it avoids ramping down production and therefore allows us to potentially continue production of Series 4. Secondly, the Vietnam building is a copy exact of the KLM 5-6 building, which will facilitate an accelerated and cost-effective implementation. While we have not provided the time line for the Vietnam ramp, the key milestones for this location will follow approximately one quarter behind those of the Malaysia site. The Vietnam factory will have 1.1 Gigawatts of production capacity once fully ramped. I'll now turn the call over to Alex who will now provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 10 I'll begin with the second quarter operational highlights for our Series 4 products. As planned, module production was lower in the second quarter at 513 Megawatts DC, a decrease of 28% from the prior quarter and 35% from the same period last year, as we ramped down Series 4 production in our Malaysia facility in preparation for Series 6. Capacity utilization, which excludes the lines taken out of service, remained high, and increased slightly to 99% in Q2 versus 98% in the prior quarter. Our full fleet conversion efficiency improved to 16.9% in the second quarter, a 20 basis point increase from the prior quarter and an impressive 70 basis point improvement versus Q2 of 2016. Module conversion efficiency in our best line averaged 17% in Q2 to 10 basis points sequential improvement and a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the Series 4 fleet average efficiency to level off near our current 17% efficiency as future technology improvements and investment are focused on Series 6. However, keep in mind that the current 17% efficiency level is not indicative of Series 6 efficiency, which will be higher at the time of product launch and is expected to continuously improve thereafter as we execute our technology road map. As a reminder, our record cell efficiency standard is 22.1%. In the past, we've demonstrated a consistent ability to translate record cell and record module efficiencies into production our regular cadence and we expect this process to continue with Series 6. Name plate efficiency also does not tell the entire story and the energy yield advantage of our modules must also be kept in mind. Whilst our focus remains on realizing the potential of Series 6, our Series 4 product remains very competitive from both an efficiency and energy advantage standpoint. Turning to Slide 11, I'll discuss some of the income statement highlights of Q2. Note that I'll be discussing some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share and please refer to the appendix to the presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Net sales in the second quarter were $623 million, a decrease of $269 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in net sales resulted in primarily from lower systems project sales partially offset by higher third-party module volume. The reduction in system projects sales was primarily a result of recognizing 100% of the Moapa project in Q1. In the second quarter, we sold Switch Station to EDF Renewable Energy and recognized a large percentage of the revenue. We will recognize revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis until the project reaches COD expected in Q3 of this year. Switch Station is an example of how First Solar can work jointly with utilities and commercial customers to meet their needs for clean, affordable solar power. This is the first project we sold to EDF Renewable Energy, and we look forward to future partnership opportunities. Also with the sale of this project, we now recognize another important component of our guidance for 2017. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects decreased to 63% from 92% in Q1. Third party module sales were $228 million in Q2 versus $71 million in the prior quarter. Note that third-party module volume recognized in the quarter was meaningfully lower than third-party shipments based on timing of meeting all revenue recognition criteria. Gross margin improved to 18% in the second quarter from 9% in Q1. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from the different mix of systems projects recognized between the quarters. The lower Q1 gross margin was related to the sale of our Moapa projects, which as we've indicated in the past had a gross margin profile lower than we would normally expect from a systems sale. The sale of Switch Station in Q2 is more representative of our targeted gross margin range on a system project sale. Gross margin in our Components segment was 17% in Q2 versus 26% in the prior quarter. Operating expenses excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges were $79 million in the second quarter versus Q1 adjusted OpEx of $72 million. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily due to higher plant start-up costs associated with Series 6. We expect plant start-up costs to continue to increase in the second half of the year as Series 6 work in Ohio and Malaysia intensifies. Highlighting the impact of the OpEx reduction initiatives we've undertaken, our OpEx, excluding restructuring and plant start-up, has decreased by 27% versus the same period in 2016. Restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our Series 6 transition were $18 million in Q2, a decrease of $2 million from the prior quarter. The Q2 charges primarily related to net losses on the disposition of Series 4 and Series 5 manufacturing equipment. Excluding restructuring-related items, adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $32 million compared to $12 million in Q1. The increase is due to higher gross margin on Q2 sales partially offset by the increase in production start-up expense. On a GAAP basis, our operating income for the quarter was $14 million. We had a tax benefit of $40 million in the second quarter compared to $6 million of tax expense in Q1. In Q2, we recognized a $42 million discrete tax benefit resulting from the acceptance of our election to change the tax basis of a foreign subsidiary. As we indicated on our last earnings call, this amount could have been up to $55 million and was not reflected in our guidance at the time. Note also that both quarters have tax benefits associated with restructuring charges. Second quarter EPS was $0.50 on a GAAP basis, and excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, $0.64 on a non-GAAP basis. This compares to Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.09 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.25. Relative our indication on the prior earnings call, Q2 non-GAAP EPS was higher than anticipated due to both the $42 million tax benefit and the initial recognition of the Switch Station projects. I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information on Slide 12. Our cash and marketable securities balance ended the second quarter at $2.2 billion, a decrease of approximately $217 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position declined by $261 million to $1.9 billion. The decrease in our cash balance is primarily timing related as we'll receive payment for the majority of the Switch Station's project sale in Q3. Q2 net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by $171 million. Change was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable from higher module sales in the quarter, and the timing of payment from the Switch project sale. Total debt at the end of Q2 was $321 million, an increase of $44 million from the prior quarter. The increase resulted primarily from issuing project level debt for projects in Japan and Australia. Cash flows used in operations were $166 million in Q2 versus cash flow from operations of $493 million in the first quarter. Free cash flow in Q2 was a negative $271 million compared to positive free cash flow of $380 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $105 million compared to $113 million in the prior quarter. Moving on to Slide 13, I'll review our updated full year 2017 guidance. As it relates to project sales in our guidance, our expectation of selling both the California Flats and Cuyama projects in the second half of the year remains unchanged. Both projects were offered to 8point3 earlier this year, but have since received a waiver of the negotiation period from 8point3, providing First Solar the right to offer and sell these projects outside of the yieldco in accordance with the terms of the ROFO agreement. In the case of Cuyama, we've recently entered into a sale agreement for the project, which we expect will close in the third quarter. The sale of California Flats is progressing well and we're in late stage negotiations with a buyer. In terms of international projects, our guidance also assumes we sell a small number of our Japan projects and some India projects in the second half of the year. As we progress further into the sales process on Switch Station, California Flats, Cuyama and certain of our international projects, our expectations for the sale value of these projects have increased. This additional information, plus an increase in expected volume of third-party module sales have led us to increase our net sales guidance range by $150 million, to a revised range of $3 billion to $3.1 billion. We're raising the midpoint of our gross margin guidance 400 basis points to a revised range of 17% to 18% as a result of the expected increase in the sale value of projects and based on continuing cost improvements. We've revised our GAAP operating expense range to $370 million to $395 million. The low end of the range has increased as we now have better line of sight to remaining operating expenses. Note that total plant startup expense of 2017 is still anticipated to be around $50 million. We've lowered the top end of the operating expense guidance range by $10 million as a result of a reduction in our expected restructuring charges. The revised range of restructuring related items is now $40 million to $55 million with approximately $38 million of charged incurred through the first six months of the year. The low end of our non-GAAP operating expense range has also been raised by $10 million resulting from higher variable compensation and higher project related transactions structuring and sales costs, which have driven higher project values. Our non-GAAP operating expense excludes the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges. We're raising our EPS guidance by $1.75 as a result of better economic value expected from project sales and improved operational performance. In addition, we're raising EPS as a result of the $42 million discrete tax benefit in Q2. Our revised non-GAAP EPS range is now $2.00 to $2.50 and our GAAP EPS range has been revised between $1.55 and $2.20. Note that our non-GAAP EPS assumes a full-year tax benefit of between $25 million and $30 million. As it relates to the second half of the year, the quarterly earnings profile will be highly dependent on the timing of the sale of California Flats and various international projects. Depending on the project close timing, particularly for California Flats, second half earnings could be much more heavily weighted to Q3 versus Q4. The fourth quarter is also expected to have relatively higher plant startup expense and lower module shipments. In terms of cash, we've raised our ending 2017 net cash guidance range to $2.1 to $2.3 billion, a $600 million increase versus prior guidance. Expected higher net cash balance is a result of several factors. Firstly, approximately $125 million of the increase is attributable to the higher expected value of project sales. Next, an additional $125 million is a result of our lower 2017 CapEx spend. Keep in mind, the CapEx reduction is timing related and we expect to spend that capital in 2018. Additionally, we expect project development spend in 2017 to now be around $200 million lower primarily due to timing. Some cases where our updated plants to use Series 6 modules, we will now complete more development work on those projects in 2018. The remaining updates to our net cash guidance is a result of improved working capital, primarily associated with our module business. Operating cash flow guidance has likewise been increased as a result of the expected higher project sale pricing, lower development spend and improved working capital. This expected working capital benefit is attributable in part to our plans to recycle capital faster from our systems business and is also a reflection of the decreasing capital intensity of our project business as costs continue to decline. Overall, we're very pleased with the cash generation of the business during this transition period. This provides us with great flexibility to invest in the future of our technology and manufacturing capacity, while still having adequate capital for our systems business and other priorities. I'll now summarize our second quarter 2017 progress on Slide 14. We had solid financial results in the second quarter, boosted by our sale of our Switch Station project. Our net sales were $623 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.64. Our ending cash balance was $2.2 billion with $1.9 billion of net cash. We raised the midpoint of our GAAP EPS by more than $1.80 and our non-GAAP EPS by $1.75. Our Series 4 module efficiency remained solid with a full fleet average of 16.9% and lead line efficiency of 17% in Q2. Our bookings for the quarter were impressive with 1.5 Gigawatt of new business contracted and mid-to-late stage opportunities of over 8 Gigawatt. Our Series 6 transition is progressing well with the arrival of tools at our Ohio and installation is underway. And with an increase in Series 6 mid-to-late stage opportunities, we're pleased with the initial response from our customers around Series 6. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and will open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to Philip Shen. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, Mark, Alex. Thanks for the questions. The first set of questions I have are around capacity. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were evaluating maintaining Series 4 capacity beyond the Gigawatt that you've talked about. Can you give us a sense of how much that might be? And then, as it relates to Series 6, once you get Terra zero, 1, 2 and 3 up and running, I believe you'll be at 4 Gigawatts of capacity. When do you think you could hit that 4 Gigawatt? Could we get there in 2019? What is your base case expectation for 2019? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes, so I'll take the first one on the Series 4 capacity, and I'll let Alex talk to the Series 6 and what the first three Terra plants capacity-wise provides to us and the timeline of expected production in 2019. As it relates to Series 4, one of the things that we said in the call, and I want to make sure people understood as well is that we have not made a decision instead of doing the third Series 6 plant in Malaysia, we're actually moving that now to Vietnam. So as you all know I think, or most of you know, we have a building in Vietnam that we never began production in, but we will now move Series 6 third factory to Vietnam. And that provides capability then to look at our KLM plant 3 and 4, as it relates to the timing of how long we'll continue to run that production. So we have optionality in really the first four plants in KLM, KLM 1-2, KLM 3-4, as it relates to continuing Series 4 production into 2018 or through all of 2018. Our current plan assumes that all that production would be stopped in the middle of 2018. We also have capability in two lines in Perrysburg. We had six lines in Perrysburg. We've actually shut down production of the south building which maintained four production lines. We've had that production, obviously have ramped that down so we can ramp up Series 6. But we still have the other two lines in Perrysburg that we can evaluate. So we have, call it, 10 lines as it relates to decisions that can be made as it relates to Series 4 and how long we continue that production. We're evaluating alternatives right now. There's a lot that's going into our decision making as it relates to running Series 4 production. Part of it is underlying project economics, module economics, making sure we can capture what we think is fair value for that product. The other is obviously most important is making sure none of it has any impact to distracting or delaying the roll out of Series 6. If there's anything that would cause a delay in the Series 6, we would not do that. We're 100% committed to getting the most competitively differentiated product into the market as fast as possible. So we don't want do anything with Series 4 that would jeopardize our Series 6 launch. The other thing I would say is that as it relates to Series 4, I want to capture as much of the value stream as possible. So I'm not just looking to capture module sales, per se. If I could find a way to continue to run Series 4, capture all the way through development or through EPC, through O&M, but capture more of the value chain, those are the things that will inform our decisions around what we do. We feel very fortunate to have the optionality around Series 4m but, again, the top priority is we won't do anything to jeopardize the launch of Series 6. So I'll pass the Series 6 question over to Alex. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So as it relates to Series 6, the plan we've laid out, which is about $1 billion of capital spend, has us with the first line in Perrysburg at 550 megawatts and then a full high-volume manufacturing line at about 1.1 gigawatts. So we will go first to KLM and then, as Mark said, over to Vietnam for the second Terra factory. If you look at that spend now, that gets us to about 3.5 gigawatts of production in 2019 and has us leaving exiting 2019 just under 4 gigawatts of capacity. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Operator, we can go to the next question. Operator : We'll go to Krish Sankar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Chirag Odhav - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is Chirag Odhav on for Krish. Could you just comment a little bit on any changes in customer activity resulting from the ongoing Suniva trade case? And have you noticed an increase in customers looking to secure longer term pricing as a result? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes, so there's two sides on the customer activity. One is fundamental demand for solar and solar power plants. Obviously, 201 hasn't changed that demand profile at all, and what we said in our prepared remarks is that there is a tremendous increase in demand for solar, driven by utilities and looking at long-term integrated resource plans and understanding the affordability and the competitiveness of solar. So that's obviously driving more demand. We're seeing a global increase in solar demand. Again, it's driven off of demand elasticity so as the prices of solar come down, we've seen a significant increase in demand associated with that. We're also starting to see, as we said in our prepared remarks, a pretty significant increase in utility scale commercial and industrial opportunities. There's a pretty robust pipeline from that standpoint. So the fundamentals as it relates to solar hasn't been impacted or is not at all driven by anything that may happen on a trade case. The trade case here in the U.S. \u2013 is it driving potentially customers to make their procurement decisions sooner than they would otherwise? I think there's probably some of that. I think people are trying to get access to supply in advance of any ruling that may be made. You know, trying to protect their projects as it relates to their embedded economics and secure a module supply. So I do think that that is happening in the marketplace and depending on how the trade case plays out, we may see more of that activity here over the next quarter or so. Operator : We'll next go to Tyler Frank, Robert Baird. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hey, guys. Good quarter, and thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk about how sustainable you think current economics are? You mentioned both on the project side seeing better value for the projects that 8point3 gave you a waiver for, and then, obviously, on the module side, it seems like prices have firmed up. So as we look out two to four quarters from now, what are your expectations for overall the demand and supply balance? And how should we think about the long-term sustainability of the current pricing profile? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I'll take the discussion around module and Alex can take more discussion on the systems side. Look, I think the reality is that the module prices have \u2013 and I use the U.S. as an example \u2013 are such a relatively insignificant component of the overall levelized costs of energy. As we said before, cost of capital is even a more significant impact. Right? But the balance of system costs now are getting to be more impactful to some extent. If you look at the impact of inverters and trackers, you're seeing a more significant component of the overall LCOE. If you look at the module as an example, it will vary upon regions that you're in, but the fact it will be somewhere in the range of, call it, around $0.03 of module price drives about $1 of PPA price. So if you're thinking \u2013 you're pricing at $30, and you see a module price move by $0.03, that adds about $1 to the PPA price. That's not going to change the fundamental demand associated with procurement decisions. Right? A dollar of PPA price isn't going to change somebody's decision around whether they're going to move forward and procure. So I think that \u2013 look, it's a competitive market. Obviously, as we've said before, there is excess supply and oversupply in the industry. It is a little bit tighter on the higher-efficiency, higher-quality products so that you have to bifurcate the market a little bit that way. But as I look over the next few quarters, yes, things will continue to be competitive, but I think we're in a relatively tight range of module pricing. The other thing I would say is that where we saw some of the more aggressive pricing behavior from some of our Chinese competitors in particular, I think there are some signs of fatigue. I think some have even made statements that they've reduced shipment guidance for the year because they're going to focus on profitability. So, look, this industry moves very quickly. So to try to make a definitive call for something two to three quarters out is never easy. But I would say at least for the second half of this year, we're probably in a relatively tight range relative to where module prices will move. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: And Tyler, on the systems side, I'd say that the outlook is I think fairly sustainable. For us, there are really two things at work here. One is we are seeing a lot of interest in U.S. asset ownership at a time when there are relatively few large-scale quality assets available in 2017 and into 2018. So despite some potential headwinds around tax reform and interest rates, we're not seeing a significant change in cost of capital at the moment, and we're seeing a lot of money in the infrastructure space and in the tax equity space looking to go to work. So we're seeing a lot of interest there. I think the second thing for us, and this relates a little bit to 8point3 is the competitiveness of the yieldco and it specifically relates to the assets that we have this year in the ROFO process and the values associated with those and California Flats is a big driver of our guidance change right now. When we started marketing that asset, we were aiming to structure a deal for \u2013 to keep a residual interest for 8point3. As we progressed through that, it became clear that the structuring itself was creating a loss of value and at the same time, the yield profile of 8point3 was changing. So when you combine those two it meant that 8point3 was clearly not the best buyer for that asset. And we took that back out to market and we found a simpler and less structured deal with a much higher value that informs not only California Flats but how we think about other assets in the future. So I look at those two I think partly there's just a very robust market for U.S. asset sales today and the amount of capital and the cost of capital available is very good, and secondly, the yieldco is not really a viable buyer today for new U.S. utility scale assets, as currently capitalized. Operator : Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the gross margin outlook. I know you guys have previously talked about how margins could be potentially under pressure until Series 6 is up and running in the second half. With the current module pricing environment \u2013 what's your current outlook on component market margins? And then, for Series 6 are you still looking at about a Gigawatt of 2018 shipments? And then finally, as far as your capacity allocation is concerned for projects that you intend to complete and sell in 2018, can you maybe talk a little bit about what that number would look like? This year, for example, I think you have about a 0.5 Gigawatt of capacity that's been allocated to internal projects. How would that number change in 2018? Thank you. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Vishal, I'll take the gross margin outlook and talk a little bit about the project side of 2018 and Mark can talk on Series 6 2018 shipment. On the gross margins, what we said before and remains true is that as we stop looking to improve the Series 4 module and focus on the Series 6 module, that module is going to be most challenged just before we ramp it down. So right now if you look at our gross margins you can see that this quarter is a little lower than we've seen in past quarters. Part of that is due to ASP declines from volumes that were booked in previous quarters. And then there's a small impact from under-utilization costs as well so as we've taken down our KLM 5 and KLM 6 line, which was one of our lowest cost locations, the blended cost when you include our Perrysburg factory being a larger component of the total, Series 4 increases slightly. So I'd say that on the module side, I think the margins you're seeing today are probably are relatively sustainable over the next few quarters and we've seen pricing firm up in the U.S. a little bit. On the project side, we haven't guided for 2018, so we don't have numbers to give you today but if you look through the Q that'll come out later and it'll give you a view to what's in the pipeline and the COD dates can give you a rough guide to what we're looking at in 2018. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Relative to Series 6, we still are on target for about a Gigawatt of production for next year. You know, so that lines up to everything's on schedule and progressing as anticipated. So as we think about 2018 that still what our expectations are and again the constraint isn't necessarily our own ability to ramp, it's actually getting the tool sets from our vendors and there's a relatively long lead time from that perspective. The other thing I would say around the capacity allocation is this is what we haven't guided as Alex indicated but we did indicate in the call, and I think it's the right way to look at it is that when you look at our contracted pipeline which you'll be able to see more around that in the Q when it's filed plus our late-stage opportunities that we're pursuing right now, call it 1.9 Gigawatt, we are lined up very well for 2018, 2019 and 2020 on an average basis to be approximately a Gigawatt of systems business. So I think that's the right way to look at it. We will continue to optimize the timing of the shipments and the recognition around those assets to optimize value creation from that perspective. But I do, I feel very comfortable where we are right now with maintaining that annual volume around a Gigawatt for our Systems business. Operator : Brian Lee, Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. I had a couple of them. Maybe first off, Mark, can you comment on the pricing environment for modules in the U.S., but also globally? I know there's a bit of a difference there. And have you raised prices in the U.S. specifically and by how much if you can comment? And then just maybe lastly on that point, how are you pricing bookings especially for deliveries in 2018 given some of the trade case uncertainty? The follow-up I'd have is just around the systems visibility for the raised guidance. Can you quantify how much of a margin improvement you are seeing from the structuring change you mentioned, Alex? And then whether you think margins on systems are better than modules in the second half of the year given some of the price bifurcation we're seeing in the market? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right. I'll take the first two and have the last one. As it relates to the pricing environment, let's talk to U.S., clearly things have firmed up, right? I said that in my prepared remarks as well. So the pricing has firmed up in the U.S. Again, there's a tremendous amount of demand right now across really all segments of the market, which is firming up that pricing. Internationally, it depends on the market. Some, I would argue, are stabilizing and firming up a little bit. Others I would argue are still very aggressive, so it's hard to give you a generic statement relative to the international side of the house, but on average, I would say the global, if you take the U.S. combined with the international markets is relatively \u2013 the pricing has firmed up over the first half of this year relative to where we exited the end of last year. In terms of how we're thinking about the trade case and how we're selling forward, we continue to try to best position our pricing in the marketplace relative to the competition and sell through the differentiation and value creation that we have inherent in our model, which is the energy yield advantage. As it relates to the trade case, it's still an uncertainty at this point in time as it relates to, A, if it's going to happen, B, to what extent there would be an impact. So we haven't really informed our pricing decision, per se, as it relates to if something were to happen. I think as we get closer and we see better line of sight, we'll evaluate that. One thing I will say though is our general approach, especially as we position Series 6 into the marketplace, is we will capture fair value for the technology that we provide to our customers. But I'm not looking at this as some opportunistic ASP grab that we could get into the marketplace. I mean, we're going to engage customers from a relationship standpoint and a long-term partnership perspective and capture the right appropriate value for the product, not necessarily trying to be overly optimistic because of a potential trade dispute that may happen or may not happen. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Brian, to your second question, if you look at the EPS guidance, we're raised that $1.75. There's a tax benefit in there of about $42 million. The rest is associated mostly with the systems business. On Cal Flats, there are two things at work. One, and we brought this up, I think, on a previous call, is there was a specific development related risk item that was not in our guidance before, which has now been resolved relative to property tax. So that provides significant uptick to value and then the remainder of that then comes from the structuring and taking the deal out of the yieldco and selling to a third party. But from a value perspective, I would look at the EPS raise minus the tax as mostly attributable to the systems business. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I think, too, one thing that Alex did say I think, Brian, you're asking what does the second half margin profile look like between systems and modules, one of the things that Alex indicated in his comments as it relates to \u2013 as we ramp down production of Series 4, again, there's an under-absorbed, underutilized cost structure there that will create a little bit of a headwind on our Series 4 costs, all right, so that by default then what we would potentially expect is to have lower gross margin, which we saw in Q2 versus Q1 because of the impact. And if you use a penny as an example, if there's a penny under-absorbed costs that now has to be weighted down towards Series 4, you're talking something that's going to be 3% to 4% gross margin. So a small delta could have a significant impact to gross margin percent, and we saw a little bit of that here in the second quarter. Operator : Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer and Company. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the impact of lower energy storage prices on demand overall for projects at this point? And how you're developing, going forward, in lieu of what we're seeing in terms of that cost decline on energy storage? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So, especially in certain markets, the impact of storage, and really it's interesting because not only in mature markets that maybe have a more fundamental issue that they're trying to deal with right now, and everyone, generally, we refer to it as the duck curve phenomenon. It's not only there where there's an increased interest on storage and integration of PV with storage. We're even starting to see \u2013 as we see some of the demand now migrate into the southeast, as an example, and some of the utilities are early on in their journey for solar, and it's now strategic and integrated into the long-term resource plan, so they want to understand storage as part of that long-term solution. So we're seeing it on both sides for more mature markets, but even in more emerging markets, as well. The other thing that is a continued concern and is around grid reliability and stability, and when you see increased renewal penetration, and we've demonstrated through our work with Cal ISO and Edrolin (50:55) reports that we've issued and validated by others, is that utilities feel solar, obviously, can improve \u2013 it can provide services that actually improve reliability and stability of the grid. And that's another item that a lot of the utilities are asking a lot more about, and trying to have a better understanding of what are the proper power plant controls that can enable that. And we feel very good about our offer in that regard. It's clearly going to be another inflection point for demand generation. It enables a much higher solar penetration in a number of key markets, and what's happened with the battery side of the equation, the costs have come down significantly, and you're seeing very compelling PV plus storage. And we're actively engaging and participating in a number of RFPs. In some cases, even more almost bilateral negotiations with a couple of customers to make sure that we can demonstrate our innovation and thought leadership in this area. But I do think it's going to have a significant impact on demand as we look forward in the next five years to ten years. Operator : Sophie Carp, Guggenheim Securities. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good evening, and thank you for taking my question. Can you comment a little bit on your strategy with 8point3 Energy Partners at this point? Are you still pursing the sale of (52:12) and the situation with pricing and the project values that you see, are they impacted in any way? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. I mean, I can't go into a lot of details as it relates to 8point3, but we are still exploring strategic alternatives, which would include the sale of our interest. Specifically, it could include something more than that depending on the interest from a market perspective. I think as Alex indicated, and I said in my prepared remarks as well, is that we've captured tremendous upside by selling our high-quality assets outside of 8point3. And if you look at the delta of where the share price would have to be to effectively give us equivalent economics on an asset like Switch Station, it would actually have to trade above where the IPO was. And there's no indication of anything in that range. And I don't think we'll ever see the yield that we saw at that point in time coming back anytime soon. So I think where we stand we know that we can capture better \u2013 we can get better value capture for our assets with other buyers. It creates more of a competitive dynamic for the sell-down process. So I don't think strategically anything has changed from our perspective relative to 8point3. Our strategic valuations are still ongoing. I have no other updates beyond that. Operator : Our final question from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. Let me go back to the tariff issue. There have been some estimates from the SEIA and others that if this Suniva request were granted, it would cost something like 100,000 jobs in the U.S. solar value chain. Because you guys are both hardware vendors and project developers, I guess my \u2013 the way I would frame it is what do you think is the optimal outcome? Are you rooting for Suniva's request to be granted or not? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So, it's interesting. We're part of SEIA. We love SEIA. But I can take you back to the first trade cases, the anti-dumping cases that were put in place 2012-2014 timeframe, same argument was there. This would be a complete destruction of jobs. All these jobs that were being created were going to be a tremendous risk. We're going to lose hundreds of thousands of solar jobs. If you take that time and move it forward, nothing more than \u2013 the only thing that happened is the industry is continuing to thrive. Nothing fundamentally changed and disrupted the demand profile for solar. There were no jobs loss. There were jobs created over that period of time. So I know the rhetoric there and people like to lead with that, but I think you've got to step back and look at the reality. And I think if you look at the most recent history, you would argue that the reality is something much different than maybe what people are saying. What I would say is go back to statements we said in our last call. There is a tremendous oversupply in the industry, right? We believe in free and fair trade to the extent there's not fair trade then there's an element of enforcement potentially that needs to be put in place. We're not a part of the trade case. We're not anticipating to be a part of the trade case. You know, the process of the way it rolls out right now, there's still an evaluation of an injury of the termination. That'll be made sometime by the mid to late September. Once if there is a determination of injury at that point in time, they'll move forward into a remedy phase which lasts, again, another six weeks to eight weeks. We would potentially, if we do get involved, potentially be involved as it relates to input around remedies. I do think that a modest type of \u2013 if there is a determination of injury, a modest type of remedy will not be harmful at all to the industry and I think it'll continue to thrive and more jobs will be created. If the current proposed recommendations around minimum prices in tariffs go up into the $0.40 tariff range of minimum price is close to $0.70, I think that could have an impact. Something more modest, let's call it, $0.10 to $0.12, maybe $0.15. I already said $0.03 of module price is $1 of PPA price. So if you add $0.10, we have $3 of PPA price. Something going from $30 to $33, I don't think will be destructive at all to the underlying demand profile for solar. It won't change the \u2013 it won't create any type of risk to job creations and I think the industry will continue to thrive. We already referenced the storage impact. That's another kink in the curve of making solar more competitive and viable and sustainable. So look, we'll continue to evaluate. We'll continue to provide input as it gets to a remedy standpoint. But I don't see that there's \u2013 that the rhetoric that there's going to be some tremendous destruction of job creation in the U.S. I don't think that's going to happen. And hopefully what it will do is enable more manufacturing jobs in the U.S. I think that's another opportunity that this could result in and whether we do it in our plant in Ohio or others potentially bring more manufacturing in the U.S., I think that'd be a great thing.

This call is being webcast live on the Investor Section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Haymore, for our First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and technology update then Alex will discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2017. We will then open up the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual the results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It's now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by highlighting some of our third quarter financial and operational results. Firstly, we achieved record quarterly net bookings of 4.5 gigawatt DC, which brings our year-to-date net bookings to 6.7 gigawatts. The strong bookings demonstrates the tremendous customer acceptance of our Series 6 product and the impact of market factors that are leading to an acceleration of procurement timing by certain customers. Our financial results for the quarter were also strong with revenue of over $1 billion and EPS of $1.95, driven by the sale of both our California Flats and Cuyama projects. Turning to slide 4. Our Series 6 transition continues to progress according to plan and remains on schedule. We are now more than halfway through our 18-month Series 6 journey which we started in November of 2016. I am very pleased with the impressive results the team has delivered so far. At our Ohio factory, the frontend of our Series 6 line is now almost completely installed and most of the equipment is operational and in various phases of acceptance testing. We are also beginning the significant milestone as we run glass through the core semiconductor equipment including the CADTEL coater (03:10). At our Malaysia factory yesterday, our first vapor transport deposition coater arrived on site. And the process of installing the tools will ramp up in the coming weeks with the added benefit of the learnings from our Ohio factory. While we'll save further updates until our Analyst Day on December 5, we continue to be excited by our progress. Before continuing further, I'll briefly comment on the trade case. As we have said in the past, we're not a party to the proceedings, which excludes thin film. However, we did recently make our voice heard on this matter but only after several responding parties opposing import release, repeatedly cited First Solar in their briefs and testimony to the ITC. With our name being used in this way before a U.S. investigative agency, we couldn't stay silent, particularly when we recently were forced to eliminate hundreds of manufacturing and non-manufacturing jobs in the United States. As we said, we have consistently witnessed seemingly irrational market behavior from foreign companies who have continued to expand production capacity, despite years of low or negative returns on investment. We believe that an effective and reasonable remedy on crystalline silicon PV imports can indeed co-exist with continued growth in the U.S. solar demand in all segments of the solar industry. We believe that U.S.-based manufacturing is essential to sustainable economic prosperity, and we will support the U.S. government actions that best serve American workers, manufacturers and the solar industry overall. Continuing on to slide 5, I'll discuss our bookings in more detail. We have booked in excess of 5 gigawatts since our last earnings call and netted against this volume is approximately 500 megawatts previously booked with customers under framework agreement which has now been terminated. The net result is quarterly bookings of 4.5 gigawatts DC which, after deducting year-to-date shipments through September of 2.1 gigawatts, brings our total remaining expected module shipments to approximately 7.4 gigawatts. As a note, the delivery timing of these bookings stretches over the next several years and includes volumes planned for shipment into 2020. The strength of Q3 bookings is a reflection of the positive customer response to our Series 6 products, as highlighted by the number of Series 6 contracts included in these bookings. In certain cases, when contracting this volume, we have included flexibility which allows us to meet our customers' demand with either Series 4 or Series 6 modules. Approximately half of the Q3 bookings have this contractual flexibility. Prior to this quarter, the only Series 6 bookings were designated for our own captive projects. But with these recent contracts, we now have a substantial Series 6 pipeline with third-party customers. As mentioned last quarter, there has been a confluence of events that has driven a recent strong bookings performance. Firstly, global demand continues to be strong as solar becomes increasingly economical, relative to other sources of generation. Secondly, while not impacting the underlying demand fundamentals, we have seen the Section 201 trade case in the United States accelerate module procurement timing by some customers. Lastly, the recent surge of demand in China has created, in the near-term, a relatively tight supply of Tier 1 module manufacturers. Looking to the future, we anticipate the historical global module supply/demand imbalance to persist and therefore expect the global pricing environment for modules to remain aggressive. For this reason a successful transition to Series 6 remains a top priority as it is expected to provide us with the most competitively differentiated product and best position the company for long-term profitable growth. I want to highlight an important point on Q3 bookings. While most of the bookings for the quarter were third-party module sales, we expect to eventually add additional scope such as EPC and O&M services to some of these arrangements, which would increase our overall systems bookings number. Historically, a developer would contract for EPC and O&M services, concurrently with selecting a module provider. However, in the current U.S. market environment, the procurement process is in some cases inverted, with developers looking to secure module supply in advance of contracting for additional services. For example, our bookings in the U.S., includes approximately 85 megawatt DC of systems bookings for a project in Florida. The module bookings with this customer are much higher than 85 megawatts, and we are in the process of negotiating EPC agreements for the remaining volume. However, until the EPC agreements are signed, the bookings will be reflected as module-only sales and not shown in our systems project pipeline. Once any additional agreements are signed, while it will not be reported as incremental megawatt bookings, it will represent revenue and margin on top of the original module bookings. We're excited to have been awarded this volume with a strategic customer in Florida. Most importantly, this volume is representative of growing utility-owned generation market segment as our customer plans to own and rate base these projects. Another important and growing market segment is the utility-scale commercial and industrial segment. In the U.S., we signed a greater-than-400-megawatt DC supply agreement for a project that will further a major corporation's goal to run its operations with 100% renewable energy. More detail will be available in the future. Adding to our growing track record of successes with corporate customers, we have recently been awarded a greater-than-100-megawatt PPA for a project that will supply another major corporate customer with clean and affordable electricity. Once we finalize and sign the PPA, these opportunities will be reflected in our bookings. Both of these projects highlight the growing demand from corporate customers for solar power and the expertise that we can provide to meet their needs. The remaining bookings in the U.S. were primarily for module sales in the southeast. Turning to our international bookings, in Australia, we signed new module supply agreements of 240 megawatts. This brings our total contracted delivery pipeline to over 500 megawatts and highlights our leadership position in supplying large-scale solar projects in Australia. In Japan, we booked 21-megawatt DC systems project, which now brings our total contracted pipeline in Japan to over 240 megawatt DC. Illustrating the opportunity for more Japan systems bookings in the future, our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunities are greater than 300 megawatts DC. In other parts of Asia Pacific region, we have also had significant module sales in both Malaysia and China. With the bookings in the quarter, we have now sold through our approximately 3.6 gigawatts of Series 4 module supply, based on our current production plan. As we indicated in the last earnings call, we have been evaluating options that could extend Series 4 production beyond our current operating plan. These options could add up to 1 gigawatt of additional Series 4 supply in 2018. As we said previously, any decision to extend Series 4 production would not impact our previously announced Series 6 rollout plans. We intend to make a decision on this later this year and we'll provide an update at the upcoming Analyst Day. Turning to slide 6. I'll next highlight our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunities. Similar to prior quarters, this metric includes all of our advanced stage opportunities which have shipment dates that extend over the next several years. Despite the current quarter's strong bookings, our potential bookings opportunities with 6 gigawatts have been very resilient and decreased only 2 gigawatts relative to the prior quarter. For reference, the opportunities shown here are almost entirely for Series 6 modules. The growth in our mid-to-late stage Series 6 opportunities over the past several quarters demonstrates the extremely positive response from customers to our Series 6 product, both in United States and internationally. Included in the 6 gigawatts of potential bookings are over 2 gigawatts of systems opportunities. This includes U.S. utility RFP opportunities, over 800 megawatts of projects with corporate customers and international opportunities in Japan and Australia. A meaningful portion of this volume has already been awarded and is in contract negotiations. If eventually booked, shipments to these systems project would fall primarily in 2019 and 2020. Also keep in mind that we have a much larger number of early stage systems opportunities not included in this total. The number of mid-to-late stage opportunities, give us confidence in achieving our targets of an average of 1 gigawatt per year of systems business. Lastly, turning to slide 7. I'll highlight some key points from our recently published 2017 sustainability report, which is available on our website. At First Solar, environmental and social responsibility, are a part of our core values. These are values we embrace each and every day as we produce modules and construct power plants that provide clean, affordable energy. To illustrate this point, with over 17 gigawatts of modules installed worldwide, our PV solutions displace more than 12 million metric tons of CO2 per year, which is equivalent to powering more than 8 million homes annually based on worldwide averages. We are proud of the positive environmental impact our technology has done on society and the progress we continue to make. While solar technologies have a lower impact on the environment and fossil fuels generation, a distinguishing feature of our technology, a substantial benefit it possesses compared to other PV modules. On a lifecycle basis, our thin film modules have the smallest carbon footprint, lowest water use and fastest energy payback time in the industry. In fact, a recent third party study evaluated the environmental footprint of five different PV technologies and found that the impact of First Solar's PV systems are about two-thirds lower than the average PV system. Our lower carbon solar technology not only has positive environmental benefits but also provides a competitive advantage in commercial discussions. For example, as we announced earlier this year, we were awarded a 107-megawatt module supply agreement by Photosol as part of the third round of the French tender. Photosol's decision to select First Solar's module was not only a result of our competitive offerings but also because of the significant environmental benefits that our module technology offers. First Solar's PV technology enables customers to decouple their business growth from emissions, water use, and waste generation. As PV solar continues to become a dominant power generation technology, we expect that choosing low-carbon solar will become increasingly important for our customers, similar to what is already happening in France. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will provide more detail on our third quarter financial results and discuss the updated guidelines for 2017. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Before providing an update on our performance for the quarter, I'd like to highlight our 2017 Analyst Day which will take place on Tuesday, December 5, beginning at 10 :30 AM Eastern Time. The event will be webcasted live, and will include an update from our executive management team on strategic priorities related to our technology and capacity roadmaps, progress we're making in key markets, and our latest business outlook. There'll be a link to a live webcast of the event available at the Investor Relations section of our website, and our executive management team looks forward to the opportunity to provide you with the latest updates on our business. Starting on slide 10, I'll start by discussing our third quarter operational highlights. Module production increased slightly in the third quarter to 527 megawatts DC, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter. Production was 32% lower year-over-year resulting from Series 4 lines ramped down to make way for Series 6 production. Capacity utilization, which excludes the lines taken out of service, was 98% compared to 99% in the prior quarter and 97% in Q3 of the prior year. The full fleet conversion efficiency improved to 17% in the third quarter, a 10 basis point increase quarter-over-quarter and a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. Module conversion efficiency on our best line was unchanged versus the prior quarter at 17% but improved 40 basis points year-over-year. As we've indicated previously, we expect the Series 4 fleet average efficiency to level off near our current 17% efficiency as future technology improvement and investment are focused on Series 6. Continuing to slide 11. I'll discuss some of the income statement highlights for the third quarter, including some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Net sales in the third quarter were $1.1 billion, an increase of $464 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales results primarily from the sale of the California Flats and Cuyama project as well as higher third-party module volume. Solar California Flats project was an important milestone to achieve our financial guidance for the year, and in Q3, we recognized nearly 70% of the revenue and margin on the project. We'll have minimal revenue recognized in the fourth quarter, and project activity will pick up again in 2018 as we construct the remainder of the project with Series 6 modules. Cal Flats is another example of the growing corporate demand for solar power. With 130-megawatt AC of the project off take contracted Apple, this represents one of the largest solar projects supplying power to commercial end user. As Mark mentioned, we're in discussions with corporate customers on a number of additional utility scale opportunities and provide more detail at our upcoming Analyst Day. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales of solar power systems revenue, which includes both our EPC revenue and solar modules used in systems projects, increased to 72% from 63% in Q2. Third-party module sales increased to $300 million in Q3, up from $228 million in the prior quarter. Gross margin improved to 27% in the third quarter from 18% in Q2. This increase results primarily from the higher gross margin on the California Flats and Cuyama projects in Q3. The gross margin of our components segment improved slightly to 18% in Q3 versus 17% in the prior quarter. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude restructuring asset impairment charges, were $84 million in the third quarter compared to $79 million in Q2. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily due to higher plant startup costs associated with ramping up Series 6. We expect plant startup costs to increase in the fourth quarter as Series 6 work in Ohio, Malaysia, and Vietnam intensifies. Year-over-year, our OpEx, excluding restructuring and plant startup, decreased by 23%, highlighting the impact of restructuring efforts undertaken last year. Restructuring and asset impairment charges to accelerate our Series 6 transition were less than $1 million in Q3 compared to $18 million in the second quarter. Excluding restructuring-related items, adjusted operating income in the third quarter was $208 million compared to $32 million in Q2. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily due to higher revenue and improved gross margin. On a GAAP basis, our operating income for the quarter was $207 million. Tax expense was $8 million in Q3 and includes an $11 million benefit from the expiration of the statute of limitations on various uncertain tax positions. This compares to a $40 million tax benefit in Q2, which included a $42 million discrete tax benefit resulting from the acceptance of our election to change the tax status of a foreign subsidiary. Third quarter EPS was $1.95 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And this compares to Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.64. Next, turn to slide 12 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance ended the third quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $490 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position increased $467 million to $2.4 billion. The increase in our cash balance is primarily related to cash received from the sale of the California Flats and Cuyama projects. Net working capital in Q3, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $415 million. The change was primarily due to a decrease in project assets from the sale of the California Flats and Cuyama projects. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $344 million, an increase of $23 million from the prior quarter. The increase resulted primarily from issuing project level debt for a project in Australia. And as a reminder, essentially all of our outstanding debt is project-related and will come off the balance sheet when the project is sold. Cash flows from operations were $581 million in Q3 versus cash flows used in operations of $168 million in the second quarter. Third quarter free cash flow is $484 million, compared to negative free cash flow of $272 million last quarter. Capital expenditures were $98 million compared to $105 million in the prior quarter. The improved operating cash flow and free cash flow in Q3 was driven by the aforementioned project sales. Turning to slide 13, I'll review our updated full year 2017 guidance. With the sale of the California Flats and Cuyama projects in Q3, the largest components of our guidance for the year are now complete. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate the majority of our revenue to be generated from third-party module sales. We expect minimal system sales in the U.S. as the remaining revenue recognition on the second phase of California Flats will largely occur in 2018, and as we look to optimize other projects in our systems portfolio for Series 6. In terms of international projects, the sale of the small Japanese projects originally included in our 2017 guidance, is now expected to close next year. Regarding our project portfolio in India, our guidance continues to assume that we close a portion of these project sales in the fourth quarter with the remainder in 2018. With that context, I'll discuss the updated guidance ranges in some more detail. Firstly, as it relates to net sales, we're leaving our forecast unchanged. We've updated our gross margin guidance to approximately 18%. Our non-GAAP operating expense range is unchanged, but we've lowered the high end of our GAAP operating expense range by $10 million, as we expect lower restructuring expenses. Operating income guidance has been raised as a result of both the improved gross margin forecast and from the lower restructuring expenses. The flow-through impact to EPS is to raise our GAAP EPS midpoint to approximately $2.20 and our non-GAAP EPS to $2.50. Our non-GAAP EPS assumes a full year tax benefit of between $25 million and $30 million which is unchanged from our prior assumption. In comparison to our initial expectations coming into 2017, our year-to-date performance reflects not only the strength of our systems and module businesses, but also tremendous execution during the course of the year. Relative to our non-GAAP EPS of $2.86 for the nine months ending September 30, the $2.50 midpoint of our full-year guidance implies a loss in the fourth quarter of around $0.35. There are several factors impacting the fourth quarter which account for this loss. Firstly, plant startup levels in Q4 will be much higher than in Q3; and while this expense is necessary to ramp up Series 6, it does present a transitional impact. Secondly, as mentioned previously, we expect minimal systems business in Q4 due to project timing and as we optimize projects for Series 6. We continue to have a strong product pipeline and anticipate selling a number of projects in both the U.S. and international markets in 2018. And lastly, with Series 4 production taken offline earlier this year to support the series 6 transition, lower volume is also impacting sales. All of these factors combined to impact our fourth quarter, but our full-year earnings remain strong. Finally, we've left our net cash, operating cash flow, CapEx and shipment forecast unchanged. I'll now summarize our third quarter 2017 progress on slide 14. We had solid financial results in the quarter, driven by the sale of our California Flats and Cuyama projects. Our net sales were $1.1 billion and EPS was $1.95. Our ending net cash balance was $2.4 billion, an increase of $467 million from the prior quarter. We raised the midpoint of our non-GAAP EPS by $0.25 to $2.50. Our Series 6 transition is progressing well with the installation of the front end of the line in Perrysburg nearly complete and with the arrival of the first coater in Malaysia. Our net bookings are strong and exceeded 4.5 gigawatts and our mid- to late-stage opportunities were resilient and currently stand at 6 gigawatts. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the floor for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will take our first question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Congrats on the bookings. What are the key factors influencing whether or not you book the remaining gigawatt of Series 4? Can you describe also the terms of the Series 4 contracts for delivery in 2018? Our checks are coming back with \u2013 that you guys have meaningful cancellation fees. And then finally, given the flexibility of some of your contracts to ship either Series 4 or 6, what is the potential number of megawatts of Series 6 modules that could be sold in 2018? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right, Phil, I'll try to take those as best as I can. At first off, as it relates to decision points as it relates to continuing the production of the Series 4. We're continuing to evaluate the options and alternatives that we do have. One of the primary things (26:39) which we said is we won't do anything that's going to compromise our transition to Series 6. First and foremost, that's the most important thing that we need to do. And any decisions we make, we'll make sure that we preserve the original committed-to Series 6 production schedule as we highlighted for 2018 and 2019. Look, as we've created optionality within the \u2013 these contracts, it's given us the flexibility. As we indicated, about half of the volume that we have booked allows us to either fulfill those contracts with Series 6 and Series 4. If you take the 4.5 gigawatts in net bookings, it would highlight then that there's a meaningful portion of that that would be \u2013 potentially could be served with Series 6, which would then give you an indication that most of the volume through 2019 could be contracted with Series 6, assuming we made \u2013 did not make a decision to extend Series 4 production. Some of the contracts also go out to 2020, so I'm going to make sure that that's highlighted as well. The volumes go out that far. Also though remember that 2018 volume for Series 6 largely was consumed within our own development assets already. So most of that Series 6 shipment profile is mainly going to sit within 2019 and in 2020. Have we put provisions within those contracts, especially those that have mainly focused on Series 4, but also we've incorporated similar provisions in our Series 6 agreements, as we book that far out, we do want to make sure that there's \u2013 the contracts are an obligation by both parties to perform. There's implications for us if we don't perform and there's implications to our customers for whatever reason, if the contracts or the purchase orders were terminated. And so it's protecting both people's interest to ensure long-term fulfillment against those contracts. Again, we're going out much further on module sales than we would historically and so we have included certain provisions within our contracts that would protect both our interest and I guess also make sure that our customers' interests are protected relative to our ability to perform and deliver against those obligations. Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Great. That's helpful. And if it's possible, is it \u2013 can you give us a sense for the gigawatts in 2018, 2019 and 2020? Is it possible to give us a sense of that mix at all, Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: No, we're not breaking out the detail. I think the way to look at there's 7.4 gigawatts now that as you think about the balance of this year going out into 2018, 2019 and 2020, so that's a tremendous amount of volume that has been contracted at this point in time. As we said the 3.6 that has been originally identified in our production plan that is sold through at this point in time, so that entire volume has been sold through. And if you remember, this year we'll end up producing another \u2013 the run rate would indicate about 500 megawatts this year. Then what we had indicated for next year was a gigawatt of Series 4 effective and a gigawatt of Series 6. So that incremental gigawatt of \u2013 for that we could produce with Series 4 next year, it could take Series 4 production up to 2 gigawatts next year. Look, we'll have to make a decision, as we indicated in our prepared comments by the end of the year. We're looking at various events that could inform our views around that and the ability to fulfill those contracts and what's the best product mix to do that with, and I would expect to have a lot more information, as we indicated in our prepared remarks in the Analyst Day in the first part of December. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. I heard you \u2013 thanks for the question. Alex, if I heard you right, I think on the startup costs you mentioned that there would be a Vietnam-related start-up cost. Can you just talk about what that's for? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: As I think we talked about on our last call we have an old factory in Vietnam that was built but never commissioned, and as part of the optionality that we're keeping around continuing our Series 4, we are moving to use that factory for Series 6. So as we do that there'll be start-up costs associated with bringing that up in the same way they would be with taking the existing Perrysburg and Malaysia facilities over from Series 4 to Series 6. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I think as Alex indicated, what we said in our last earnings call that are effectively third Series 6 plant was going to be in Malaysia. We've made a decision now to move that to Vietnam, and what that provides now, is this gigawatt of optionality that we're referring to around Series 4. We could continue to produce more Series 4 in Malaysia for an extended period of time. That's a decision that we're still evaluating but making that decision to go to Vietnam has freed up some optionality around Series 4 production in KLM, Malaysia. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So first off, given the record bookings, is there a strategy that involves accelerating CapEx in Series 6 as opposed to just keeping Series 4 online longer or maybe potentially doing both in a parallel track? Just thinking or just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the Series 6 out-year ramp, given the initial demand seems to be pushing lead times out here. And then just as a follow-up, I'll squeeze this in now. On the margin trajectory, if we look at components it's been pretty consistent here in the past couple quarters in the high-teens which makes sense given the pricing stability in the market. If we take your prior comments around end of life margins for Series 4, it sounded like the first half of 2018, we'd see much lower gross margins than where you're tracking at today. If you do the 1 gigawatt optional Series 4 volume moving through the next couple of years, is it fair to assume though that 1 gigawatt optional volume would be in the range, margin-wise of what you're seeing today, as opposed to the end of life commentary you've made in the past? Thanks, guys. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right. I'll take the Series 6 acceleration comment and let Alex take the margin comment .Look, Series 6, at least in the near-term, if we roll through what previously highlighted by almost a year ago I guess, when did our guidance call, that we would roll out and ramp to about 3.5 gigawatts or so of production by the end of 2019 with an exit rate that would be north of that number, call it 4 gigawatts. The ability to do anything within that timeframe is largely constrained by lead time from our equipment manufacturers. So anything to really accelerate Series 6 within that window, call it over the next 8 to 10 quarters I guess, it would be very, very difficult. But when you go beyond that, as we think about in the 2020 and into 2021, there could be some optionality and some decisions that we could make around acceleration. But the problem is, it's why there's kind of simultaneous equations here, but the constraint still to get to Series 6 is the ramp down to Series 4. And so we have to play through that equation and that mix, we've got to solve and what we think is the right production profile for Series 4 and then that'll sort of give us the parameters and the goalposts I guess that we can make a decision around Series 6. So there's multiple constraints near term, it's the equipment lead time. Alternatively, there was also the transition from 4, and how much longer we choose to continue to run Series 4 in order to potentially look at options around the timing of accelerating Series 6. But to the extent there was optionality, it would be out in the 2020 timeframe. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. And Brian, on the margin point, so we have previously indicated that we are not spending money on improving the efficiency of Series 4. Our competitors are not standing still and we expected the Series 4 to be added to most challenged, just before we start production. So as we moved into 2018 under the current plan. Competitors won't stand still and at that point, we would have our most challenging gross margins. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have seen an acceleration of procurement in the U.S. And we've also seen a relatively tight Tier 1 supply demand market globally based on the current dynamics mostly in China. And that's had a stabilizing impact on pricing in the near-term. So in the near-term, that's why you're seeing margins hold up. I would also say that if we do extend the Series 4 production beyond our current plan in 2018, we would only do so if we have acceptable margins to us. So I think you can assume you would see a similar margin profile going forward into 2018. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing mechanisms in these contracts? I appreciate that you've got teeth in it for both sides. But is pricing fixed on these forward bookings here, and how should we think about that? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, they're very similar to bookings that we've had historically, right? So, there is a fixed price associated. There's fixed price from Series 4. There's a fixed price from Series 6. Now, we do have, this will primarily relate more to Series 6 because there's not going to be a significant difference of bin availability for Series 4. But we do have provisions in our contracts that would give us what we refer to as bin adder or price adjusters such that if we ship them a higher watt panel, then there's a price increase associated with that. But these are fixed prices that go out for an extended period of time, as we've indicated. They potentially have some bin adders, more that will be in the Series 6. There'll be some in Series 4 as well. But think of them as firm fixed prices, obligations by both parties to perform and implications to the extent that those parties do not perform. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Chirag Odhav - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. This is Chirag Odhav on for Krish. Can you guys generally see higher marginal prices leading towards lower IRRs for the project business? Do you expect this to make things a little less attractive for future projects? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: So if I look at the IRRs we're seeing in the market today, I think you have to look at the total underwriting assumptions in it (37:32). So the IRR headline number itself has stayed, I think relatively resilient despite potential headwinds around tax reform and interest rates and other things. So I think we're seeing IRR stay relatively stable. If I look to whether the module pricing is impacting those, clearly, the model is pretty simple, right? You've got your input costs, your revenue stream, and your return on capital. So if you change one of those, you're going to have an impact on one or other of the remaining two. So I think, clearly, there's going to be some impact. I think if you look at the increase in pricing we are seeing on the module side, it is not significant to the point where it's going to have hugely detrimental impact on IRRs. And depending on when your project was bid and the assumptions that you used at the time around forecast, interest rates, yield curves, cost of tax equity, other operating expenses, merchant curves (38:31) and other things, I think the general level of increase in module pricing is still allowing viable projects today. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I think the thing to remember, too, is that I think the module represents something close to about 20% of the overall LCOE. And so, it is a small component relative to the other 80% when you aggregate everything else up. So it shouldn't have a significant impact, but the reality is what was the assumption that was used when those PPAs were bid. If there were assumptions that module prices were going to fall very quickly and that there was an assumption of a continued oversupplied industry, that therefore, people would be selling at or below cash costs in order to liquidate inventory. Where pricing is now settling to, could have a more impactful impact to somebody's return expectations because of a very aggressive assumption they had when they bid into a particular power price. But on a normalized basis, if you're just looking at the delta from where module prices were at the low to where they are now, it's not going to have a significant impact. But if you were taking a low point and then further assuming price erosion against it, you could have a more significant impact from that standpoint. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, what percentage of your bookings historically have been module plus bookings? I appreciate the comments you made about negotiations you've had with some of your existing customers. So, should we assume 30%, 40% of these bookings would eventually get converted to module plus or could that be a smaller number? And then also, what percentage of your bookings are with some of the utility customers and corporate buyers versus some of the smaller developers and distributors that could potentially negotiate, renegotiate on pricing? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So, in terms of \u2013 I guess what I'll throw into the bucket for \u2013 when you say module plus, I'll throw in kind of EPC and O&M services into that discussion. As we indicated in the call, there's multiple hundreds of megawatts of opportunity against the bookings that we've recognized that we could capture additional services for OEM and EPC in particular. And what's happened is that there's obviously a desire, we're constrained, and there's a desire to lock up on module prices as quickly as possible. We're still in negotiations with some of our customers that would include additional scope beyond just the module. But it's a relatively significant number. But there's a lot of work still to be done to determine whether or not we can capture something beyond just the module side of the equation. So we'll work through that. As it relates to the C&I bookings, what we said in the call, I guess, 400 megawatts or so of module sales that were related to a customer \u2013 commercial industrial customer. There's 800 megawatts of late-stage negotiations against the 2-gigawatts of systems business that we highlighted that is for C&I. That segment of the market is relatively robust. We're seeing a lot of activity there and really, it plays strongly to First Solar's capabilities and brand strength, bankability, balance sheet strength, the buying decision-maker there I would align more to utility who's looking for utility owned generation. We're not selling into a developer who's only looking to develop and then sell down the asset as quickly as possible and not thinking about total lifecycle cost of ownership and performance and those types of things. We're selling to a much more sophisticated informed buyer that can clearly understand the differentiation capabilities that First Solar can provide them. So it's a very exciting segment of the market and one that we expect to continue to grow. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: And Vishal, you mentioned small developers that could renegotiate. I just want to reiterate that the contracts we signed today are firm obligations on both sides with penalties for failure to perform on both sides. So regardless of size of developer, we have taken bookings with contractual terms that we think will hold on, on both sides. There had been security deposits paid. So I don't see a significant risk of renegotiation. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Y. Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, mainly my questions are on bookings, right? So I guess first, if I remember, you guys are targeting around 2 gigawatt next year and maybe a little more than 3 gigawatt in 2019. So does that mean that you're fully booked out for 2020 since you mentioned that your bookings stretch out to 2020? And how \u2013 maybe the other way to ask is how linear is that booking? And then just quickly in terms of converting those projects from third-party module to lighting (43:43) systems sales. Does that mean that as you are successfully doing that, there could be pretty meaningful upside to this 1 gigawatt target \u2013 per year target that you laid out? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Sure. So, I guess on the bookings side \u2013 and then I'll let Alex take the second one. Well, if you take \u2013 what we said in the November of last year, we have about 2 gigawatts in 2018 \u2013 2 gigawatts in 2018, about 3.5 gigawatts in 2019, and then you got a run rate number that gets you to about 4 gigawatts in 2020, right? So you've got 5.4 gigawatts plus 4 gigawatts, so that's 9.5 gigawatts over those years. 2 gigawatts, 3.5 gigawatts and 4 gigawatts plus you still have 500 megawatts or so this year. And so you can add that into that number. So you're starting to get to a number north of 9 gigawatts. And what we said is that we contracted 7.4 gigawatts, is what we still have left, right. So I would tell you that assuming nothing else changes, assuming we do nothing on Series 4 and adding incremental capacity, assuming we don't do anything to try to accelerate some Series 6 into 2020, then we've got somewhere in the range of 2 gigawatts left to sell over that horizon. I mean that's kind of what the pure sense of the map will tell you. And that's the kind of backdrop of analysis that we're looking at right now, to look at various scenarios and determine what is the best thing to do to best meet the needs of our customers as well as drive to the optimal financial results. And the one thing I want to continue to remind people on is that variable contribution margin flows through to accretive EPS expansion. Right? So, we've said before, we showed you a slide last year, refer to those slides we showed you in the last guidance call, right, that we can leverage fixed cost in our manufacturing but more importantly, in our OpEx. So as you think about that contribution volume flow-through, it's going to flow through to a very attractive EPS impact, not only because of the fixed cost structure and their manufacturing OpEx but as most of you also know, we have a very efficient tax rate. And so, a lot of that incremental contribution margin flows through almost 100% to EPS expansion. So we're looking at all options. As you know, it's very complicated, a lot has happened very quickly, and we'll share more of that information and what our views are around that in the Analyst Day in December. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: And Edwin, on the gigawatt of systems business and the upside there. So we mentioned before that we're tracking to about 1 gigawatt a year on average of systems business, the self-development, and third-party EPC work. It's possible that in 2018, we may be under that average as we are looking to optimize our self-development platform for Series 6. However, in the near-term, if you look today towards that gigawatt, we're about two-thirds of the way there for 2018 today. There are a lot of opportunities, as Mark said, to bring that 2018 number up to the 1 gigawatt given this recent accelerated procurement dynamic where modules are being locked in ahead of other services around EPC and O&M. If we can bring that beyond the 1 gigawatt, we're very happy to do that, and we'll continue to work as opportunities in both 2018 and then beyond into 2019 and 2020. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. And I think the other thing, too, is that this is \u2013 obviously, it's a very impactful decision, strategic long-term in nature. I think our assessment around that and the rationale on how we think through that, to me, is better communicated in a forum such as the Analyst Day, right? So we can give more detailed, thorough discussion, quality of discussion around that. And so, I know everybody is going to continue to sort of ask the same question, but at this point in time as we've indicated, we are who we are. We'll give you more information in December. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Cindy Motz with Williams Capital Group. Please go ahead. Cynthia Motz - The Williams Capital Group LP : Hi. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. Well, I was going to rephrase that 2018 guidance another way, but I guess we will get it at the Analyst Day. So \u2013 but would it be fair to say that just everything you've been talking about, Mark and Alex, just the demand you're seeing from utilities and I guess C&I. And I was going to ask you about community solar, how that's going, about that you're feeling like better about 2018 and then also, in general, I was thinking about the sustainability thing you said that people are coming to First Solar because of the sustainability metrics and everything. Is that just overseas or is it in the U.S. as well? And then I had one follow up. Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. First of all, I guess I'll take the sustainability question first is that it is \u2013 it's really \u2013 it's impactful and it's driving where it really hits and resonates extremely well is with large scale commercial, industrial customers in particular, all right? I mean, their whole intended objective is obviously to focus on clean renewable energy and not only for their own consumption, but they're also looking at that from the standpoint of their supply chain. So some of our customers are actually making the requirements to have flow-through into their supply chain and using that as a criteria that they're making supplier decisions around. And so when our sustainability efforts come through and we highlight the benefits that we can provide to the environment, it really resonates extremely well with the number of our large scale commercial industrial customers. And sometimes that even get us into the table and into the discussion. It's just that concept in and of itself is sort of facilitating some conversations with our customers. The international side though we highlighted, the tender process that was done in France and it is more impactful. And actually I was over in Europe recently speaking at a conference and that even some of the other European countries are even looking at that as the criteria. And I think it may evolve deeper into other regions of the world and it's something that we think is, needs to be taken in consideration because when you look at the payback period relative to our technology, compared to other technologies, it's a much quicker, faster payback and if you really focus around (50:14) reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It's a better solution and way of doing that. Cynthia Motz - The Williams Capital Group LP : Okay. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. On the \u2013 Sorry, Cindy, so on the utilities seeing like community solar demand, I think as we mentioned in our scripted comments, there's over 800 megawatts of projects with corporate customers in that list. So, as Mark said, the sustainability is very helpful and we're seeing that drive the C&I interest \u2013 significant interest across the board for utility as well. There's a lot of interest in getting solar in \u2013 a lot of people have targets for end of decade and across the IPP space and the developer space is seeing interest to get in ahead of ITC expiree. So across the board, utilities, C&I communities, all of us seeing a lot of activity and a lot of driving force. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Joseph Osha - JMP Securities LLC : Hey. I made it. Thank you. If you look at your production plans for 2018 and 2019, what you've just said about Vietnam, the 3.5 gigawatts and so forth, it seems as if there might be room for a greenfield fab in here somewhere. I'm just curious as to your reaction to that statement and whether there might \u2013 that might be part of the planning process. Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: You know, we're looking at all options, and as we go further out into the horizon, that type of option does come into play more so than near-term. Near-term is the fastest way to get more Series 6, just use the existing brownfield that we already have. But as you go further into the horizon, a greenfield or a modified greenfield, it could be an expansion to one of our existing facilities. It could be a new building to \u2013 in Vietnam or it could be a new building in Malaysia or it could be a new building in Perrysburg, right, so it's an attachment to an existing manufacturing operation. It would probably be the priorities in how we would think through it, but clearly that's part of the decision making that we're evaluating, but again those would be situated further out in the horizon in 2020 and beyond. Operator : And this concludes today's question-and-answer session, as well as the First Solar's Q3 2017 financial results call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

(Private Wealth Management) Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the First Solar's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investor section of the First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore, First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. We will then open the call up for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures, such as free cash flow, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It's now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin today by briefly discussing some of our 2017 key accomplishments which are highlighted on slide 4. In the year that began with a great deal of uncertainty, with anticipated industry excess capacity leading to bearing module ASP projections, coupled with the challenges that came with our Series 6 transition, I am pleased with our focus, execution and ability to exceed our earnings and cash flow commitments for the year. 2017 was a record year with net bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC, with Series 6 representing 2.6 gigawatts DC of the bookings. Contracting this business is an outstanding accomplishment and provides improved clarity to ramp and grow our Series 6 production over the coming years. In addition to strong bookings in the U.S., we saw strength in international markets led by Australia, Japan, India and Europe, where we booked over 1.7 gigawatts. While strong demand in China and the 201 trade case in the U.S. helped to firm up the macro environment, our collaborative approach to working with customers and the progress we've made towards the launch of our Series 6 module were key contributors to achieving this record bookings. O&M bookings were also strong last year as we added nearly 2.9 gigawatts of projects, bringing our total O&M fleet under contract to 8.5 gigawatts. Notably, nearly two-thirds of the megawatts booked were in projects where we were not the developer. Successfully winning O&M on projects not developed by First Solar opens our addressable market, which helps create scale for O&M business and thereby enhances our competitive position. Our operating fleet continues to perform at the highest level with effective availability of 99.6% in 2017. There were also a number of notable achievements in our technology, manufacturing and EPC operations last year. Specific to our Series 6 product, as we highlighted at our Analyst Day, we manufactured our first complete module at our factory in Ohio late last year. This target was reached ahead of schedule and represents a tremendous achievement by our entire technology and manufacturing teams. While focused on the development of our Series 6 product, improvement to our Series 4 product continues to roll through our production fleet last year. Our full year 2017 Series 4 fleet average efficiency increased 50 basis points to 16.9% as compared to 2016. The increase in efficiency, coupled with reductions in material and labor costs, enable us to improve the cost per watt of our Series 4 modules by 14% from the prior year. Note this is significantly better than our 9% reduction targeted for the year. Recently, we achieved a significant manufacturing milestone as we produced our 200 millionth module since the inception of the company. This accomplishment is a tribute to the dedication and commitment of our manufacturing associates worldwide. We've had tremendous learnings along this high volume manufacturing journey, which has resulted in one of the most differentiated technologies in the industry. Since 2008, we've seen a greater than 40% improvement in line throughput, a more than 50% increase in module efficiency and reduction of cost per watt of over 70%. These results are truly remarkable. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress on driving down balance of system cost. Relative to our expectation at the beginning of 2017, we have lowered the projected balance of system cost per watt by 20% on major projects that we will be constructing in 2018. This improvement is a result of lower labor cost from utilizing Series 6 modules as well as taking a comprehensive value stream approach to driving down all aspects of BoS cost. With over 7.5 gigawatts of cumulative modules installed, the extensive experience of our EPC team provides not only tremendous benefit to our captive project pipeline but is also a key component of the power plant solutions we offer to corporate and utility customers. As a result of the strong Series 4 bookings, the cost per watt improvements made, and by executing on our key system project sales, we achieved 2017 earnings adjusted for the one-time impact of tax reform and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $2.59 per share which is on the high end of our guidance range. With over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow generated and an ending net cash balance of $2.6 billion, we further enhanced our industry best balance sheet. In late 2016 when we announced the acceleration of our Series 6 roadmap, one of our key objectives was to ensure sufficient liquidity throughout this process. Thus far, we are tracking extremely well against this objective as measured by our net cash at the end of 2017. The net cash position is even more significant when taking into account the fact that in 2017 we invested roughly $500 million in Series 6 capacity, representing approximately 35% of the total committed CapEx which includes capital for a second factory in Vietnam that was not in our original roadmap but we still have a significant capital investment ahead. We're in a strong financial position to execute on the roadmap. Turning to slide 5, I'll take the next step to provide an update on our Series 6 manufacturing plant. Beginning with our factory in Ohio, we have continued to make good progress since we last updated you at our Analyst Day. Our Ohio Series 6 line is now fully integrated and manufacturing modules for extensive testing and evaluation is ongoing. The line performance thus far is consistent with our expectations for this stage of the start-up and our next major milestone is the start of high volume manufacturing, which is scheduled to begin in the second quarter. In Malaysia, where our first equipment began arriving last October, we now have over 90% of the front-end tools installed and we are targeting the first complete module at this location in Q2. In Vietnam, the first factory is ready for tool installation and we've reached a key milestone in January when the coder arrived on site. Construction activities at the second Vietnam factory are ahead of schedule and hiring for the factories is progressing. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making across these three subsequent Series 6 factories with construction activities, factory readiness, tool delivery and tool install all advancing according to plan. Primary focus continues to be on maximizing Series 6 capacity. However, as a result of strong Series 4 bookings, we have decided to restart two lines of Series 4 production in Ohio, which were shut down in late 2017. With our prior workforce having transitioned to support the new Series 6 process, we are currently hiring new associates to run these lines. These additional lines will provide us with 180 megawatts of additional volume in 2018. Whether we continue to run these lines beyond 2018 will depend on market conditions. This incremental capacity raises our 2018 expected production to 3.1 gigawatts DC. Next, I'll discuss our bookings since our last earnings call. As highlighted on slide 6, we had net 2017 bookings of 7.7 gigawatts DC versus shipments of 2.7 gigawatts DC for the same period. Since the start of 2018, we have booked approximately 1.3 gigawatts of additional volume bringing our total future contracted business to 9.1 gigawatts DC. Including the 1.3 gigawatts of volume booked year-to-date, our total bookings since our Q3 earnings call are now over 2.3 gigawatts DC. Development project bookings are a key component of the 2.3 gigawatts of new business signed. Leveraging our advantaged Series 6 module, we have signed PPAs for nearly 600 megawatts DC with both utility and corporate customers. As discussed at our recent Analyst Day, demand for solar power from both utility and corporate customers is expected to grow significantly in coming years. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity and be a partner of choice for these customers. Focusing first on utility customers, we signed a PPA with Georgia Power for a 200-megawatt ac project that is expected to commence construction in November 2018 and reach COD by late 2019. We were awarded this volume as part of the 525-megawatt ac RFP for Georgia Power's Renewable Energy Development Initiative. Upon completion, it will be one of the largest solar power plants in the southeastern U.S. We look forward to continuing our partnership with Georgia Power and helping them meet the solar needs of their customers. Additionally, we have signed a PPA with APS to develop and construct a 65-megawatt ac solar power plant in Arizona with a 50-megawatt ac battery capable of delivering power for more than three hours. This project is expected to be one of the largest PV plus storage or PVS systems in the U.S. when completed in 2020. We believe this PVS project is an industry-first, demonstrating the ability of the combined technology to serve APS with a firm peaking resource which will allow APS to meet customer's electricity demands into the evening hours. We are excited for the opportunity to partner with APS on this flagship project to provide reliable, cost effective, dispatchable solar and thereby enhancing the economic value of solar energy. In addition to utilities contracting for solar via PPAs, we're also witnessing growing interest and increased approval for utility ownership for solar generation as highlighted by our recent partnership with Tampa Electric Company. As indicated previously, we signed a large module agreement with Tampa Electric Company last year and we have now contracted with them to add EPC scope to three projects which total 250-megawatts DC. We are excited about the opportunity to help them build out their fleet of rate base utility scale solar and we continue to discuss with them additional projects where we may add EPC services to our current module supply agreement. As the long-term owner of solar assets, utility buyers place greater emphasis on partnering with exceptional performance track record, a reputation for quality and a strong balance sheet. We believe we are well-positioned in this market as our strengths closely match their requirements and we expect this trend toward utility ownership to continue to accelerate. Moving to C&I, I would like to highlight our continued progress in this market segment. We signed 150-megawatt ac PPA with a major corporate renewable customer in the U.S. This agreement represents a significant purchase of solar power that will enable this customer to advance towards its 100% renewable energy goal. We will provide more detail on this transaction in the future. Similarly to utility customers, corporate renewal buyers are now not only focused on the economics and value of solar, but also heavily weigh other factors they believe give us an advantage with this customer group. Corporate customers are very focused on avoiding reputational risk which means they are looking for partners with a proven track record and financial stability. In addition, they value partners with a global reach and the ability to provide turnkey solutions. Internationally, our development pipeline in Australia continues to grow with the signing of the Beryl project located in New South Wales. This project is expected to be completed in the middle of 2019 and brings our contracted pipeline to over 100-megawatts ac in Australia. We continue to have a very active development portfolio in Australia with additional projects in our mid-to-late stage pipeline. Moving to slide 7, I'll provide an update on our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunities. At 6.8 gigawatts DC, the mid-to-late stage opportunities are more than triple the opportunities we had at this time last year. Since last quarter's earnings call, the number of opportunities have increased by a net 600-megawatts DC. With bookings of over 2.3 gigawatts DC during the same time period, gross total opportunities added exceeded 3 gigawatts. Included in the 6.8 gigawatts opportunities are more than 1.5 gigawatts of projects that we have signed but due to our disciplined approach have not yet been counted as bookings. The majority of these opportunities are expected to book over the course of the year as financing our other CPs (15:38) are closed. Also of note is that our mid-to-late stage pipeline provides visibility into contracting volume for the next several years. Over 4.5 gigawatts of the opportunities are for delivery in either 2020 or 2021, highlighting the time period in which we are discussing opportunities with our customers. System projects are another important component of the mid-to-late stage opportunities and comprise over 750 megawatts DC of these potential bookings. Similar to last quarter, this list includes opportunities with U.S. utilities, corporate customers and international projects in Japan and Australia. While not reflected as a potential booking opportunity in the 6.8 gigawatts shown, we are currently in discussions with various customers that have already purchased our modules to add EPC scope to nearly 900-megawatt DC of projects. These potential opportunities are in addition to the more than 250-megawatt DC already booked with Tampa Electric Company. While these EPC agreements will not be counted as bookings when signed, they'll be added to our contracted future revenue and be reflected in the contracted pipeline table in our 10-K and 10-Q filings. With 900-megawatts of EPC opportunities, almost 600-megawatts of new project development bookings and 750-megawatts of mid-to-late stage development opportunities, we are encouraged by our progress and remain steadfastly focused on strengthening our systems pipeline. Lastly, as recently announced, 8point3, our joint venture yieldco with SunPower, has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Capital Dynamics. This agreement follows a comprehensive multi-phase process, where more than 130 parties were contacted and expressed inbound interest and while multiple structures were considered. Based on the extensive nature of this process, we firmly believe the transaction with Capital Dynamics represents the most compelling option for all shareholders. With committed acquisition financing and Capital Dynamics' proven track record of acquiring renewable projects, we are confident that the transaction will close. We expect net proceeds from the sale of our interest in 8point3 of approximately $230 million. Please note that the actual net proceeds we receive upon closing will depend on the day the transaction actually closes. Upon closing of the transaction, the $50 million promissory note associated with our sale of interest in the Stateline project to 8point3 will be repaid. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Turning to slide 9, I'll begin by discussing our fourth quarter operational highlights. Keep in mind that the metrics provided are reflective of Series 4 manufacturing only. Module production increased slightly in the fourth quarter to 532-megawatts DC, a 1% increase from Q3. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, production is lower as a result of ramping down certain Series 4 lines in Ohio and Malaysia to make way for Series 6 production. Capacity utilization, which makes adjustments for the lines taken out of service, was 99%. Our fourth quarter fleet and best line conversion efficiency were unchanged versus the prior quarter at 17%. This will be the last quarter we report Series 4 efficiency since it will remain relatively unchanged going forward. And in future quarters, as Series 6 enters production, we will modify the operational metric to provide the most relevant information. I'll next discuss some of the income statement highlights for the fourth quarter on slide 10. This will include some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And please refer to the appendix to the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $339 million, a decrease of $748 million compared to the prior quarter. The expected decrease in net sales was due to both lower systems and third-party module sales. Systems project sales are much higher in Q3 due to the initial revenue recognition of the California Flats and Cuyama Projects. For the second phase of California Flats as well as other development projects that are scheduled to reach COD in 2018, which are optimized to Series 6 modules, there was minimal systems activity in Q4 of 2017. Projects such as Rosamond and Willow Springs, which are scheduled to be completed in 2018, have not yet been sold and therefore did not have any revenue recognized in Q4. Both of these projects are progressing well through the sale process. For full year 2017, net sales were $2.94 billion, a 1% increase versus the prior year. Relative to our net sales guidance for 2017, our actual sales were slightly lower as a result of certain project sales in India that moved into 2018. As mentioned on our last earnings call, there was some uncertainty as the timing of when these projects would be sold. And while we did close the sale of the 35-megawatts in 2017, the remaining projects are now expected to be sold this year. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our system revenue in Q4 was 39% as compared to 72% in Q3. For the full year 2017, 73% of net sales from our systems business compared to 77% in 2016. As I indicated at our Analyst Day in December, we have modified our segment reporting in order to better align with our internal analysis of the business and also to reflect the expected increase in third-party module sales as we ramp manufacturing capacity in the coming years. The module segment now includes only module sales to third-parties and the systems segment will include all revenue from the sale of solar power systems, including the module. These changes to our segment reporting will be fully reflected in our 10-K. Gross margin decreased to 18% in the fourth quarter from 27% in Q3, primarily as a result of the low gross profit projects realized. For the full year, gross margin was 19%. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude restructuring and asset impairment charges, were $99 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $15 million compared to Q3. More than half of the increase is due to higher production start-up as Series 6 activities accelerated. For 2017, adjusted operating expenses were $334 million, in line with our guidance. Combined SG&A and R&D expense decreased by 25% versus 2016 despite higher variable compensation in Q4 of 2017. And this reduction of $95 million is a significant one year reduction and demonstrates positive impact of our focused restructuring efforts. Excluding restructuring and asset impairments, we had an adjusted operating loss of $37 million in the fourth quarter compared to an adjusted operating profit of $208 million in the third quarter. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily due to lower net sales and higher production start-up expenses. For full year 2017, our adjusted operating income was $215 million. Before discussing income tax expense for the fourth quarter, it's important to understand the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation that was signed into law in December 2017. The new tax law, amongst other changes, lowered the statutory federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, imposed a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introduced new tax regimes and changed our foreign earnings subject to U.S. tax. Given the scope of our operations across module manufacturing, project development, EPC and O&M services and the global reach of our business operating across the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, India and Asia-Pacific, the impact of tax reform on First Solar is both complex and varied. Strategically, we believe the impact of tax reform will be a net positive for First Solar. We may see some short-term impact to the U.S. project development and financing markets, as capital structures and sources adapt to the new tax regime. We continue to evaluate the impact of new international tax structures on our international manufacturing and sales businesses. And we expect the lower corporate tax rate and immediate expensing of qualified equipment to be beneficial to our existing U.S. manufacturing base, as well as importantly making the option of adding additional U.S. manufacturing capacity more attractive as we look to scale the module manufacturing business. Specific to 2017 reported financials and 2018 guidance, due to the complexity and recent implementation of this tax reform, we continue to evaluate this impact. The provisional amounts that we have recorded will require additional analysis and further interpretation on guidance from government regulators. This means that we expect to continue revising our provisional estimates until we file our 2017 federal return later this year. Our 2018 guidance being provided today has also been updated to reflect our provisional view of the impact of tax reform. But in both cases, the final resulting financial impact of this tax reform may differ materially from our current estimates. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a provisional tax expense of $408 million which included a $401.5 million charge on the accumulated earnings of foreign subsidies and a net deferred tax expense of $6.6 million for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%. These items were offset by a tax benefit in the quarter bringing the total expense for Q4 to $399 million. The cash impact to this tax reform is expected to be much lower than the P&L impact. By utilizing existing tax credits, we estimate our cash payment will be approximately $101 million and we plan to pay this amount over the full eight year period allowed. As a result of the higher tax charge, lower revenue and higher production start-up expenses, our GAAP loss per share in the fourth quarter was $4.14 compared to GAAP earnings per share of $1.95 in Q3. The full year 2017 GAAP loss per share was $1.59. After adjusting for tax reform impacts and the effective restructuring and asset impairment charges, our non-GAAP loss per share was $0.25 in Q4 and our full year 2017 non-GAAP EPS was $2.59. Our $2.59 non-GAAP EPS for 2017 was near the high end of our guidance range even without including the international projects mentioned earlier that moved into 2018. I'll next turn to slide 11 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance at year-end was nearly $3 billion, an increase of $270 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position increased by $220 million to nearly $2.6 billion. The increase in our cash balance is primarily related to cash received from projects sold in the prior quarter and third-party module sales. The year-end net cash balance of $2.6 billion was higher than our guidance expectations of $2.3 billion as a result of lower development spending on certain projects due to timing, higher advanced module payments, favorable timing of collecting project receipts and working capital changes, partially offset by slightly higher CapEx. Net working capital in Q4, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $457 million. The change was primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable from module and systems collections, including final payments on the Switch and Cuyama Projects. Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $394 million, an increase of $50 million from the prior quarter. The increase resulted from issuing project level debt to fund ongoing project construction in Japan and Australia. And, as a reminder, essentially all of our outstanding debt is project related and will come off the balance sheet when the projects are sold. We had strong cash flows from operations in Q4 of $434 million, primarily as a result of payments from system projects. Operating cash flow in the prior quarter was $581 million. For 2017 full year, cash flows from operations were $1.34 billion which exceeded the high end of our guidance expectations. And operating cash flows were stronger for the year as a result of the same items that positively impacted net cash. Capital expenditures were $199 million in the fourth quarter compared to $98 million in the prior quarter as spending on Series 6 increased. For the full year, CapEx was $514 million, the vast majority of which was invested in Series 6 past expansion. Turning to slide 12, I'll review our updated full year 2018 guidance. Before discussing guidance in detail, it's important to keep in mind the expected distribution of earnings between the first and second half of the year. With Series 6 production planned to commence in the second quarter and ramp significantly in the second half of the year, we've always anticipated that first half of 2018 would be the trough in our earnings profile. Start-up expense is weighted towards the first half of the year. The timing of project sales and systems revenue recognition further magnifies the first half versus second half difference. The second half of California Flats as well as the Rosamond and Willow Springs projects will utilize Series 6 modules, which pushes more revenue and profit recognition into the second half of the year. The forecasted sale of projects in Japan is also expected to take place later in the year. Based on these circumstances, we expect approximately 25% of full year earnings to be recognized in the first half of the year with Q2 expected to be stronger than Q1. Depending on the timing of U.S. and India project sales between Q1 and Q2, there is a potential for a loss in Q1. With that context, I'll now discuss updated guidance ranges. We are raising our net sales guidance by $150 million to a revised range of $2.45 billion to $2.65 billion. The increase in net sales is a result of both the timing of the India project sales that we now expect to close in 2018 as well as the increase in Series 4 production in Ohio. Gross margin guidance has been revised down by 50 basis points to 21.5% to 22.5%, resulting from the updated mix of revenue. Operating expenses remain unchanged from our prior expectations. As a result of the higher revenue, we are increasing the midpoint of our operating income guidance by $15 million. There are certain updates below operating income that had a largely offsetting impact. Firstly, we're increasing our estimated tax expense for the year by approximately $20 million. Approximately 30% of that increase is a result of the new tax reform legislation with the remaining impact from the revisions to our forecasts. And, again, we've updated our guidance based on our provisional view of tax reform impact and the final impact could differ from our current estimate. More than offsetting the increase in tax expense is higher equity in earnings from the pending sale of 8point3, which was previously not included in our guidance. Combining the update to net sales, tax and equity in earnings forecasts leads to a revised EPS range of $1.50 to $1.90. This is a midpoint increase of $0.20 from the prior guidance. Capital expenditures have been increased by $50 million to reflect revised timing of some Series 6 capital outlays. The expected net cash balance at the end of 2018 was increased by $500 million for a revised range of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. The increase is a result of the higher than forecast ending 2017 cash balance and incorporates the expected proceeds from the 8point3 transaction of $280 million which includes the receipt of $50 million from the Stateline promissory notes. When we embarked on our Series 6 program, we were focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position throughout the transition. From a starting point of $1.8 billion of net cash in Q4 2016 and with forecasted Series 6 CapEx over a two-year period of $1.2 billion, we today expect to end 2018 with a net cash balance approximately $400 million higher than at our starting point at $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion. Finally, I'll summarize our fourth quarter and 2017 progress on slide 13. Firstly, we had tremendous success adding to our contracted pipeline in 2017 with net module bookings of 7.7 gigawatts. With year-to-date 2018 module bookings of approximately 1.3 gigawatts, we're also off to a strong start for this year. Secondly, our Series 6 roadmap continues to move according to plan. Our factory in Ohio remains on schedule towards commencing high volume manufacturing in Q2. We're very pleased with the progress we're making on our transition to Series 6. Thirdly, we ended 2017 in a strong financial position, net sales of $2.9 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $2.59 and net cash of $2.6 billion. And, lastly, we raised the midpoint of our EPS guidance by $0.20 to $1.70 and raised our ending net cash by $500 million. And, with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Can you hear me? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. We hear you, Brian. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sorry about that. Yeah. Just maybe first one for you, Mark. I thought the commentary around the development project pipeline, it sounds like you'd seen some better momentum. So, do you still see the 1 gigawatt baseline being the right target for 2018 and maybe, more importantly, for 2019 or should we be expecting some upside to that level at this point? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. Brain, the way I'd look at it, let's hold kind of the gigawatt view at this point in time. We internally are continuing to pursue all opportunities that we can in enhancing the systems pipeline. Whether it's development PPAs, whether it's utility-owned generation, whether it's working with large C&I customers, I'm happy with momentum that we're seeing right now. We're also starting to see \u2013 the announcement we had with APS on the PV plus storage, we're seeing a lot more of that opportunity in the marketplace right now. So, I think, there is a tremendous amount of momentum moving in that direction that we're very well-positioned and we have a pretty robust pipeline of projects that we're pursuing. I think what the best thing to do is right now is while we may be tilting to move above that number over the horizon, I think, let's stay at the 1 gigawatt and we'll continue to update you on our progress as we move forward. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, Mark, Alex. Thanks for the questions. First one here is on ASPs. We've heard some chatter that you may be trying to increase ASPs on existing bookings post-201. Module pricing is up incrementally following the tariffs. Do you have any wiggle room in your contracts to increase your ASPs for your 7.7 gigawatts of bookings through year-end 2017 or are they locked in? And also, does your 1.3 gigs in 2018 year-to-date reflect any of the higher pricing that the market has experienced? Secondarily, we're also hearing that there may be some additional Series 6 capacity coming available for customers. Is this primarily due to the additional Vietnam facility you talked about in December or are you contemplating yet another capacity expansion? I know you have a lot on your new plate with launching five facilities over three years but what would it take to add yet another gigawatt of capacity sometime in the next couple of years? Is that even realistic? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So on the ASP \u2013 sorry, that first, let me \u2013 again the way we've structured our contracts, that 7.7 gigawatt that you referenced, they were firm, legally enforceable obligations between both counterparties. So those ASPs were firm fixed price ASPs in both directions. So there is no room to move relative to that and we're very happy with how we contracted that volume. So it's always one of those things you could look back in hindsight and say should you have done anything differently. I'm very happy with what we did. I think we did everything we should have and we did the right thing and best positioned us not only to best serve the needs of our customers but to enable the company to continue to grow. As it relates to the 1.3 gigawatts that we booked since the beginning of the year I mean clearly the business that has not been booked in the 1.3 is a carry forward as we started beginning of this year with a clarity around the 201 case. We engage the market and we get market prices at that point in time. So is there room potentially around Series 6 in particular to get maybe slightly better ASPs than we would have recognized previously and then in the 7.7 gigawatts or I guess the 2.6 that we booked the Series 6 last year? Clearly, there is always that opportunity but again it's a balanced take around how we engage with our customers from that perspective. But it's always we want to make sure that we're giving them the best quality, best technology, enable them to be successful and to make sure we're getting a fair value for the technology that we're providing. As it relates to the Series 6 capacity, there are no firm commitments at this point in time to do anything but what we've already indicated during our Analyst Day. Now what I will say though and Alex alluded to this a little bit in his remarks, as we look at the tax reform and what's happening now with the U.S. corporate tax rate, when you look at immediate expensing, there's optionality potentially or there's scenarios I guess maybe is a better way to say that we would look to in the U.S. to add additional manufacturing as part of our overall scenario analysis across the global production platform. Looking at the U.S. has a different lens than it would have otherwise before tax reform and there is some capability that potentially says that we could get \u2013 if we made a decision to produce in the U.S. could we get some additional capacity between now and, say, the 2020 or beginning of 2020 timeframe? Could we get a little bit more capacity? Potentially. It depends on how things play out. That's a scenario that we're going to continue to evaluate. No commitment at this point in time, but it wouldn't be an order of magnitude of a gigawatt. We're talking a few hundred megawatts or so from that perspective, nothing around Series 6 that would capture a gigawatt of upside over say the next two years or so. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Mark W. Strouse - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good evening. This is Mark Strouse on for Paul. Thanks for taking our questions. So, regarding the revised revenue outlook for 2018, can you provide a little bit more color how much of that was driven by the timing of the international project versus the Section 201, the increase in Series 4 production? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. The increase is probably about $150 million rollover from the India assets. So you're going to see a relatively small piece come from the again relatively small added capacity that we're putting on into Perrysburg, the majority coming from the rollover of those India assets. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.: Thanks so much. Can you clarify how much of the bookings happened after the 201 decision was laid out? And then also if you could give us an update on where we're at in terms of the historical storage solutions that you've been working on and working with partners on? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: So I mean if you think about the actual \u2013 I guess the President made his final decision on 201 was at the end of January. So I guess if you really look at the timeline we're about a month \u2013 less than a month I guess from when that actual final decision was made. We had a significant amount of momentum going into the bookings, even before the announcement from the final decision. Clearly, there was indication of potential impact around the 201 case. Tariffs were being proposed by the Commissioners to the President. So there's been indication in the marketplace, stronger indications as we progressed through the second half of 2017 clearly. And as we indicated as well even in our mid-to-late stage pipeline, we've got over a gigawatt of basically negotiated volume that sits within that pipeline, just to various CPs (41:24). So what I would say is if you look at the profile of the bookings as they've evolved, let's say, from the middle of 2017 through today as well as plus what's in our mid-to-late stage pipeline, as we continue to move across that continuum, clearly, the indication, the overhang or the concern I guess maybe is a better way to say it of the impact of 201 continue to increase over that horizon. But the other thing I want to make sure is clear is we said this before. We have engaged our customers and we've done this in a risk sharing approach. And we have not tried to do anything that would be opportunistic or to create some form of windfall benefit to First Solar. We look at this overall industry as having tremendous growth and potential. It is a marathon. It is not a sprint. We want to have long-term relationships with our customers. We'll treat them fairly and we'll continue to give them the best technology in the industry and provide the best power plant solutions and maintaining those power plant solutions over their anticipated lifecycle. So, that's how we're thinking about kind of our customer engagement model and not to try to do something that will be short-term, opportunistic to adversely impact our long-term relationships. Operator : And we'll take our next question from... Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I'm sorry. I think there was one other question on PVS. I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I got that one as well. Look, I think the deal that we've done with APS, I think, it's unique in the fact that \u2013 and different than anything else that has been done so far. The PPA with APS is for 100% of the battery components of the energy generation. It's all for power that'd be delivered in the early evening hours. It was part of an all resource RFP, where we competed head-to-head with mainly gas peakers. They were looking for generation that was going to be dispatched in the, call it the, 3:00 to 8 :00 or even after 8 :00 P.M. type of window. So, that we're generating the PV during the day. We're storing the energy in the batteries. And then we're dispatching in a point in time of when there's the greatest need for that energy, in the evening hours. And so that's creating a completely different value proposition and kind of the changing the game around what are the fundamental economics of solar. It's not just looking at the power generation during the middle of the day. It's saying what can we do to create enhanced value by having truly reliable, dispatchable, controllable solar in the evening hours. So, I think that more and more utilities will continue to evaluate what we've done there. I think you'll see more momentum. We are continuing to see a tremendous amount of interest from our customers around thinking about storage. And whether it sits today as part of the power plant or to look at the long-term optionality around how to integrate storage at some future date that creates optionality that they may want to take advantage of in the future, especially in markets where the solar penetration is much lower than it is say in California or even here in Arizona. But it's those types of kind of forward-looking and thought leadership kind of value proposition that we're able to create with our customers. And I think there will be a lot of interest and people wanting to learn more about what we've done with APS, and we're already getting some inquiries from customers. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. A two part question. So I think at the Analyst Day you talked about 13.75 gigawatts of cumulative shipments between 2018 and 2020. I guess you've got 9.1 gigawatts of that booked now. Where does that go with the Ohio decision that you made? And then also, I think, it was buried in the footnotes, but can you just touch on the 700-megawatts of de-bookings that you saw during the year? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So, right now, the way I would look at the \u2013 if we look at the decision that we're going to continue to run two lines in Perrysburg, at this point in time, think of it as it's a commitment for this year. So there's another call it couple hundred megawatts that we would \u2013 in the supply plan relative to what we would have said in the Analyst Day. We will continue to evaluate that production as we exit this year. Do we continue to run it into 2019? Do we carry it into 2020? If we did it across all three years and you're talking in the range of about 600-megawatts, if we chose to do that. So that's \u2013 just think of it right now 200-megawatts, that's what we're committing to. We'll continue to evaluate when we make a decision to run that production longer than that. Relative to the 700-megawatts of de-bookings, the largest one that we had during the year was a project which went by a couple different names, either Tribal Solar or Fort Mojave, depending on \u2013 I'm not sure exactly how we called it in our SEC filings. So that was a PPA that we had with a California utility. And because of various reasons of viability around that project we ended up terminating that PPA. So that was a piece. And then there was a handful of module agreements that we entered into \u2013 almost framework agreements that, as we looked at the viability of those framework agreements relative to incremental demand that we were seeing in the marketplace for our Series 4 product, there was agreement between both parties that we terminated those framework agreement. So that's really what makes up the de-bookings that we highlighted in the footnote. Operator : And we will take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Mark, can you maybe talk about the margin guidance? Is it just Series 4 or is it something else that's driving the margin outlook for this year? And also relative to the 201 case announcement, have you seen any change in pricing for your products? Has prices gone down or up relative to what you guys were looking at late last year? And then as far as the 8point3 announcement goes, you guys at the time made some comments around a challenging outlook for the utility scale power market, just in terms of the forward pricing, et cetera. So what's your sense of how the margins in the utility scale market are looking right now relative to with the time of the Analyst Day? Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I'll answer the 201 and then Alex can take the question on margin and 8point3. One thing that I want to go back to, the one question around the de-bookings, I want to make sure that it's clear that those de-bookings were bookings that we had in our backlog. Actually, in one case, those booking came in, I think, in 2015. The Tribal Solar I think was around 2015. The other framework agreements were 2016, okay. They had nothing to do with any of the contracts that we have entered into in 2017. So as we've made comment that those are firm enforceable obligations with penalties, liquidation damages associated, these de-bookings had nothing to do with that because I know we continue to get asked the question, are these truly enforceable contracts? And I don't want the conclusion to be it's all de-bookings. So this is an indication those truly were non-enforceable contracts. Nothing, nothing that was de-booked had anything to do with anything we recognized in 2017. These were all much older contracts from that standpoint. As it relates to the 201 case, Vishal, as I tried to indicate before, we're trying to find a way that we can find a win-win for our customers. We want to make sure that their projects are viable, that we're getting fair value for the technology. It also allows us to be somewhat selective with who we choose to engage with in highly creditworthy type of counterparties and others. So we can be more selective from that perspective and giving the best technology that enables their business model which obviously enables ours as well. And the other thing is we're booking as we indicated \u2013 if you look at the mid-to-late stage pipeline, our bookings profile that's out in 2020 and really almost towards the end of 2020 and even into 2021, those are somewhat uncharted territory for us. So, for me to tell you what that pricing looks like relative to before and after the 201, it's hard for me to give you a line-of-sight for that, because that momentum has only started to happen over, I would say, the last quarter or so. So you can't really indicate \u2013 move it one way or the other, because we're largely sold out through 2018, 2019 and into the first half of 2020 right now. So our bookings opportunities are much further out in the horizon. What I'll tell you is that when I look at the ASPs that are out there, relative to our roadmap of Series 6 and where we're going with that technology, I'm pleased. I think it aligns up with all of our expectations in that regard. So I'll let Alex answer the other two. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, Vishal, regarding the margins, I mean the margin profiles that we gave in our Analyst Day, I think, still holds. So, what you're seeing perhaps a slight increase in margin for this year is a function of some of the systems projects that we have. We're still pleased with where the margins are in the Series 4 products, which are in line with what we guided to in December. Around 8point3 and the challenging outlook potentially of the utility scale market, I'd say, look, as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we ran a very comprehensive process, over 130 potential buyers contacted. And while we clearly would have liked to have got to a better outcome in terms of price, we do believe it's the best that are out there in the market. But it's a little bit different from how we look at a future utility scale deal. So, there's a bit of a difference in that situation. At the time we were out marketing 8point3, you had \u2013 NRG Yield was also in the market which added a little bit in terms of a less competitive situation. You'd always rather have less assets rather than more in the market at the same time. We also had the Southern Company that owned the majority interest in a lot of the projects in 8point3, were out marketing a piece of their broader solar portfolio at the same time. 8point3 has minority ownership in some of the projects and therefore that's different to a buyer who can (51:58) purchase a new project outright and have a controlling interest. You also have a mix of utility scale as well as there is REDI and C&I projects in that portfolio. The capital structure of 8point3 today had non-amortizing debt, so that was actually replaced in time as amortizing as you sold that portfolio. The asset level structures were already in place around the tax equities, less flexibility for a new buyer there, and there is also some less flexibility around providing on the (52:24) value stream to buyers around O&M, for instance. When I think about the result of 8point3 relative to I think about the viability of the ongoing utility scale business, I think, there are clearly some differences there which give me comfort that although clearly we would prefer a higher number on 8point3 relative to where we ended up, it doesn't give me significant doubts around our ability to successfully monetize our existing utility scale portfolio at the margins that we've guided to. Operator : And we will take our last question from David Katter with Baird. Please go ahead. Tyler Charles Frank - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Private Wealth Management): Hi, guys. This is Tyler Frank. I was hoping if you can discuss how we should think about margins over the longer-term. Since you have the contracts already locked in and I assume prices and if things go to plan with your cost roadmap, should we expect margin expansion going into 2019 and 2020, based off all the information you have today? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, Tyler, there is a lot of moving pieces in there and I'm not going to give you kind of a margin range. But what I'll say is, look, as we move forward, when we transition everything in the Series 6 as an example, we eliminate the form factor delta and the higher BoS cost, right. So now we've got a product that is a form factor equivalent and BoS neutral, right, potentially advantaged depending on the application and with an energy yield advantage. So, that creates a tremendously competitive product that as we move from 4 into 6 would give us an opportunity to see gross margin expansion. There's no doubt about that. In terms of what does that profile look like, there is still way too many moving pieces at this point in time to represent that. But the other thing I want to make sure that we've highlighted this in the Analyst Day, is the \u2013 if we're talking gross margin versus op margin, I think, op margin. And if we can manage to scale against our fixed cost structure, we're going to see very strong contribution margin leverage against a fixed cost structure through OpEx that's going to drive op margin expansion. So, growth and scale will be more impactful as it relates to op margin expansion, per se, than just the transition from 4 to 6 and whether or not where my ASP versus cost entitlement is around Series 6. That's going to be a critical enabler but equally if not \u2013 and like I said probably more importantly it's going to be our ability to scale against our fixed cost to drive op margin expansion. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session for today and also ends the First Solar conference call. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the First Solar's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore, from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on our website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. We will then open the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In the few cases where we report non-GAAP measures, such as free cash flow, or non-GAAP EPS, we have reconciled these measures to the corresponding GAAP measures at the back of our presentation. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Moments ago we issued a press release announcing that First Solar plans to construct a new Series 6 module manufacturing facility in Ohio, which will significantly increase our domestic production capacity. This decision in is in response to the continued strong demand for our Series 6 product and allows us to better address the growing U.S. solar market. Furthermore, it is a strong testament to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing within the global landscape. As highlighted on slide 4, this greenfield factory will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2 gigawatts and will be built essentially next to our current manufacturing operations in Ohio. Combined with our existing Series 6 factory in Ohio, which has a nameplate capacity of 600 megawatts, this additional facility will bring the total planned Series 6 production in the U.S. to 1.8 gigawatts and further solidify our position as the largest U.S. solar module manufacturer. We expect production to begin in late 2019 and the factory to be fully ramped by the end of 2020. The total capital expenditures to construct this facility are expected to be approximately $400 million and will be incurred over the next two years. The site selected could accommodate a second factory of equal size and we will continue to monitor market conditions and our relative competitive position as we evaluate the potential for adding additional capacity. There are three major benefits to building a new fully integrated manufacturing facility in the U.S. Firstly, recent U.S. tax reform and the favorable local and national business environment enhance the economic rationale for U.S. manufacturing. Secondly, the lower labor cost per watt of our Series 6 module reduces the labor arbitrage benefit of manufacturing in Malaysia or Vietnam relative to the U.S. Lastly, by locating the factory near our existing U.S. manufacturing facility, we will be able to efficiently leverage the capabilities and know-how of our experienced R&D and manufacturing teams. In terms of local economic impact, there will be a benefit from the capital spend to construct the facility, which is in addition to the approximately 500 new high-quality permanent manufacturing jobs that will be created directly by our operations. We also expect to significantly grow our local supply chain to support the higher production volume and, thereby, create additional new jobs and economic benefits. Furthermore, this growth will create economies of scale for our supply chain partners to enhance their cost reduction roadmaps. Turning to slide 5, an important item to highlight is that our new factory announcement will not have any impact to the previously-announced Series 6 roadmap as we exit 2020. As shown on slide 5, with this new U.S. factory Series 6 global nameplate capacity is expected to increase to 6.6 gigawatts. In combination with approximately 1 gigawatt of Series 4 capacity, we expect to have 7.6 gigawatts of total nameplate capacity as we exit 2020. Relative to the production plan that we provided at our Analyst Day in December, today's announcement, combined with the recent restart of two Series 4 lines in Ohio, is expected to add an incremental 1.2 gigawatts of supply over the next three years. We will provide additional details on the progress of the latest Series 6 factory on future calls. Turning to slide 6, I'll next discuss the progress we have been making to ramp our Series 6 factories. In terms of manufacturing readiness, which captures elements such as building preparation, tool installation, staffing and other activities, we continue to make excellent progress and we scored our readiness as green across all four of our factories. The most notable achievement to highlight is the start of production at our Ohio factory at the beginning of this month. To put this achievement in perspective, 18 months ago, when we announced the decision to accelerate our transition to Series 6, we were confident in the journey we had embarked upon. However, the new equipment and manufacturing process that needed to be designed and validated, we knew the journey would be challenging. The fact that we have been able to meet our initial target of mid-2018 production and begin shipping modules to projects is a tribute to the capabilities of our associates and First Solar's commitment to delivering results. Next, in Malaysia, we achieved a significant milestone earlier this week as we produced our first complete module. The factory continues to move steadily closer to the start of production in Q3 and is aided by the learnings from initial ramp in Ohio. We are likewise making good progress with both Series 6 factories in Vietnam. The front end of the line of the first factory is now 90% installed and the construction of the second factory is continued on schedule. While we are pleased with the manufacturing readiness progress, we are working through a number of issues related to our manufacturing ramp. For this reason, we have scored the three associated metrics of wattage, throughput and product readiness as yellow. The first thing to note is that the issues we are having are normal occurrences for this phase of factory ramp and we are proactively addressing them. Related to module wattage, we are encouraged by the steady progress and ongoing improvements that we have been making since we started the line. The current production entitlement yields 90% of the modules being produced at or above 400 watts, with the top bin of distribution at 420 watts. Over the next 90 days, we see a clear path to an average production bin of 415 watts and a top bin of 425 watts. Furthermore, the early module wattage gives us confidence in our long-term roadmap which takes us beyond 425 watts per module, as we discussed at our last Analyst Day. Throughput, which measures the number of modules produced each day, is the area where we are currently placing the greatest focus and working to improve equipment availability in order to increase production levels. Notably, the front end of the manufacturing line, which includes the most complex and unique processes, such as deposition and laser scribing, is performing well. However, the less technically-challenged back-end assembly processes are where the current constraints are. And therefore, we are placing the greatest focus on this portion of the line. As we indicated at the onset of the transition, we believe the greatest potential risk was not whether the core Series 6 module technology would function properly, but whether there would be schedule risk given the four factories would be ramping in succession under an aggressive timeframe. To put the schedule risk in context, it is not a matter of if we will reach the expected output levels, but rather a question of when we will get there. To the extent that some of our existing challenges persist, Series 6 supply in 2018 could be at the low end of our expected range. As originally planned, we believe that any near-term shortfalls in Series 6 can be managed and resolved effectively, given flexibility that we have in the module delivery schedules to our own self-developed projects. Overall, we are encouraged by how far we have come on this transition. But due to the complexities of the undertaking, the potential for near-term production delay still exists through the ramp period. The third manufacturing ramp metric provided is Series 6 product readiness, which captures product testing requirements, whether from the customer or other entities. While the product is meeting the design intent on all fronts, there is a score of yellow based on the completion of timing. We anticipate the certification may slip a few weeks past our original target. However, we remain confident that it will not be a question of whether we obtain these certifications, but rather a question of time before it's completed. One other note on product readiness is that our EPC customers and structured ecosystem partners continue to familiarize themselves with Series 6. They continue to roadmap new innovative mounting structures and to request capabilities that enable lower total systems costs. First Solar is evaluating Series 6 frame design variants that can also bring mounting application capabilities in response to this customer's input. In summary, while we're working through typical ramp and related issues, we are very pleased with our progress to-date. The execution to reach this point has been tremendous and we are encouraged by the manufacturing readiness of our factories and the current module wattage results. Next, I'll turn to slide 7 to discuss our bookings activity since our last call. As I mentioned previously, our decision to expand capacity was based on the strength of the demand for our Series 6 product. In roughly two months since our last earnings report, we have contracted 2 gigawatts of additional volume, which brings our total year-to-date net bookings to 3.3 gigawatts. After accounting for shipments through the end of Q1, we now have a balance at 10.6 gigawatts of future expected shipments at this time. While this level of visibility \u2013 with this level of visibility into shipments between now and 2020 combined with our mid- to late-stage pipeline, which I will discuss shortly, we feel confident in making the decision to add additional capacity. The largest single booking among the recent deals we have signed is a 750 megawatt module supply agreement with a leading U.S. developer. Combined with a separate agreement signed last year, we have now contracted with this customer for over 1.2 gigawatts of module deliveries in 2019 and 2020. Our other bookings for the quarter were primarily module sales and include deals with various U.S. customers as well as international bookings in Turkey, France and other locations. With more than 350 megawatts booked in Europe since the beginning of the year and over 580 megawatts booked during the past 12 months, we are making good progress in this region. Our continued progress in these markets is aided by our low carbon footprint, energy yield advantage and focus on customer engagement. While not included as new bookings, since our last earnings call, we have signed EPC agreements with two customers for a total of 380 megawatts DC. In each case, a module supply agreement was already in place and we've now added EPC scope. The first of these agreements was with Vectren to construct a 50 (12:55) megawatt DC project in Indiana that's expected to power more than 11,000 households. Construction of the project is expected to begin in the second half of 2019 with project completion in 2020. This utility-owned project will utilize Series 6 modules and highlights First Solar's plant design approach, which is tailored to the utility ownership values. We've also signed an EPC agreement with Longroad Energy for 315 megawatt DC project in Texas that is expected to be completed in late 2019. We look forward to future collaboration with Longroad as they continue to build out their U.S. development pipeline. In combination with our previously signed EPC agreements with Tampa Electric, we now have over a 620 megawatts DC of contracted EPC projects that we will construct over the next three years, in addition with over 500 megawatts of EPC opportunities that are not yet booked, we are still in discussions with customers. Turning to slide 8, I will next discuss our mid- to late-stage booking opportunities, which have grown to 8.3 gigawatt DC from 6.8 gigawatts in the prior quarter. With 2 gigawatts booked during that time period, the actual growth increase in opportunities is approximately 3.5 gigawatts. In terms of the geographical mix, the largest increases were in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. The increase in the U.S. opportunities were a combination of both systems and module opportunities with a combination of utilities, developers and corporate customers. In Australia, several project development opportunities have progressed to the point where they are now included in our pipeline. The remaining increase in opportunities made up of potential module sales, primarily in Japan and Australia. Similar to last quarter, the total potential opportunities include deals that are signed, but not yet counted as bookings. Approximately 1.2 gigawatts of such projects are included in the 8.3 gigawatt total and the final booking decision is dependent on the closing the financing or other CPs. The shipment timing of these projects is also noteworthy as more than 6 gigawatts or approximately three-fourth of the total mid- to late-stage opportunities have deliveries in 2020 or later. The profile of these potential bookings matches up closely to the timing of the additional capacity that we have announced today and provides good visibility into demand over the next several years. Lastly, we saw positive growth in the mix of system opportunities in our potential bookings versus the prior quarter. Systems project opportunities now comprise 1.9 gigawatts as compared to less than 1 gigawatt approximately two months ago. This increase is a result of the progress we're making in our project development pipeline in the U.S. and Australia. Taking into account the fact that we have booked approximately 600 megawatts of development business and signed EPC agreements of 620 megawatts primarily since the beginning of the year, our recent momentum is building, our systems pipeline is encouraging. With additional mid- to late-stage development opportunities of nearly 2 gigawatts, we have a strong foundation to meet our target 1 gigawatt per year of systems business. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Turn to slide 10, I'll start by covering the income statement highlights for the first quarter. Net sales in Q1 were $567 million, an increase of $228 million compared to the previous quarter. The increase is due to the sale of 155 megawatts of projects in India, 15 megawatts of projects in Japan and initial revenue recognition from the sale of the Rosamond project in the U.S. It's worth noting that although our first Series 6 modules produced will ship to the second phase of our California Flats project, which was sold in 2017, Rosamond is the first project we sold that will use exclusively Series 6 modules. As mentioned on last quarter's call, there was a potential for loss in Q1 if some or all of these projects did not close. But the execution of these deals was a significant contributor to revenue and earnings for the quarter. First quarter revenue also included $55 million related to the settlement of a California state sales and use tax examination associated with the EPC contracts. As a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our systems revenue in Q1 was 72% as compared to 39% in Q4. Gross margin improved to 30% in the first quarter from 18% in the prior quarter. The higher gross margin was primarily a result of the mix of higher gross profit projects recognized and the settlement of the sales and use tax examination. On a segment basis, our first quarter systems gross margin was 40% and our module gross margin was 6%. The system segment margin was strong as a result of the India, Japan, and U.S. projects sold in Q1. The decline in the module segment gross margin was due to lower Series 4 ASPs associated with supply agreements that were contracted several quarters ago. The average ASP of module sales in Q1 is not reflective of pricing on more recent bookings and we expect module segment ASPs to improve in coming quarters. Even as ASPs increase, the module segment gross margin through the remainder of the year is expected to be low, due to ramp-related costs at the beginning of Q2 and because initial Series 6 module production is targeted towards the systems business. And, as a reminder, our segment reporting was revised last quarter and the module segment now includes only modules to third-parties. The systems segment includes all revenue from the sale of solar power systems, including the module. Q1 operating expenses were $99 million, an increase of $2 million compared to Q4. Plant start-up increased by $17 million as a result of higher Series 6 preproduction activities across our Ohio, Malaysia and Vietnam factories. The higher start-up expense is mostly offset by lower SG&A and R&D expense, which results from a decrease in variable compensation, as well as efficient expense management. Operating profit for the first quarter was $74 million compared to an operating loss of $35 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in operating profit was a result of higher net sales and the higher mix of systems projects sold. Other income was $18 million in Q1 as a result of the $20 million gain on the sale of certain restricted investments associated with the reimbursement of overfunded amounts from our module collection and recycling trust. Income tax expense for the first quarter was $12 million compared to $399 million expense in the previous quarter. Q4 tax expense was impacted by U.S. tax reform and, as indicated previously, is subject to additional analysis and further interpretation in guidance from government regulators. We did not record any adjustments in Q1 related to our original provision. And we expect to continue revising our provisional estimates until we file our 2017 federal tax return later this year. Earnings per share for Q1 was $0.78 compared to a loss per share in the fourth quarter of $4.14. Adjusted for the impact of U.S. tax reform and the effects of restructuring and asset impairment charges, the non-GAAP loss per share in Q4 was $0.25. And please refer to the appendix of the earnings presentation for the accompanying GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. Moving on to slide 11, I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at $2.9 billion, a decrease of $110 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position decreased by $155 million to $2.4 billion. The lower cash balance is primarily due to increased capital expenditures in Q1 to support our Series 6 ramp, partially offset by the $102 million received from the reimbursement of overfunded amounts from our module collection and recycling trust. Q1 net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, increased by $150 million. The change was primarily due to an increase in inventories, accounts receivable and lower accrued expenses from variable compensation payments. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $438 million, a net increase of $44 million from the prior quarter. The increase resulted from issuing project-level debt in Japan and India. And essentially all of our outstanding debt is project related and will come off our balance sheet when the project is sold. Cash flows used in operations in Q1 were $45 million due to variable compensation payments and increases in inventory, partially offset by project sales. In Q1, customers of our international projects assumed approximately $60 million of liabilities related to these transactions. And if these sales had been structured differently, such that the project debt was not assumed by the buyers, operating cash flow would have been $60 million higher. The following simplified example help to illustrate this point. If we were to sell a fully constructed unlevered asset for $100, we would see $100 increase in revenue, $100 increase in net cash and $100 increase in operating cash flow. If we sell that same asset for $100, but leverage with $80 of non-recourse project-level debt, we likewise see $100 increase in revenue and $100 increase in net cash. However, the $100 increase in net cash is comprised of a $20 increase in cash and an $80 reduction in debt, which is assumed by the customer. Now, significantly, this means there is only a $20 increase in operating cash flow in this example. Therefore, the same asset, sold with the same economic profile and the same revenue and net cash impact can show a significantly different operating cash flow profile, depending on the transaction structure. Historically, we've sold either constructed unlevered assets or assets where the sale has occurred prior to construction and, therefore, prior to the drawing down of significant debt on the project. Despite the visual effect of showing reduced operating cash flow, as we develop assets and hold them on balance sheet for some portion of construction, especially in international markets, there are benefits to utilizing non-recourse project leverage, including managing FX risk, optimizing construction equity working capital and, ultimately, optimizing overall project value upon the sale. Finally, capital expenditures were $178 million in the first quarter compared to $199 million in the prior quarter, as spending on Series 6 decreased slightly. Depreciation and amortization expense was $24 million in Q1. Continuing on slide 12, I'll discuss our 2018 guidance. Our Q1 earnings provided a positive start to the year, but we're leaving our income statement guidance unchanged for the time being because of risks associated with project sales timing and potential cost impacts associated with steel and aluminum tariffs. The primary update we're making to our guidance is the project timing pertains to the sale of our Beryl project in Australia, which was originally anticipated in 2018 which we now expect to complete and recognize revenue on in 2019. While the revenue and associated earnings of this project are moving to 2019, we're not lowering our income statement guidance due to offsetting items in our Q1 results. Separately our Ishikawa project in Japan, which is included in our guidance for the year experienced weather-related construction delays in recent months, which increases the risk of completing a sale of project this year. We've identified an action plan to mitigate the impact of these delays. However, given the size of this project and the expectation that the sale and, therefore, initial revenue recognition will occur near to or at COD of the project, we believe it's prudent to highlight the risks. If the project sale does move into 2019, there would not be any change in the expected project economics. However, we could fall to the low end of our 2018 revenue earnings and cash guidance ranges as a result. Another potential risk to our 2018 guidance is higher steel or aluminum costs due to recent U.S. tariffs. The tariffs have a direct impact on certain items such as posts and torque tubes used in construction of systems projects as well as on the frame on our Series 6 module. We're also seeing indirect impact of these tariffs through higher commodity prices. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of these tariffs and are also actively pursuing mitigation strategies in order to minimize the impact to the year. As it relates to distribution of earnings over the remaining quarters of the year, we expect Q2 to be approximately breakeven. But similarly to our guidance for Q1, this could change either positively or negatively depending on the timing of the closing of certain project sales and the closing of the 8.3 transaction. A part of the reason we expect Q2 earnings be lower is that Q2 total OpEx is expected to be the highest of any quarter of the year. This is due to both start-up expenses peaking next quarter as well as the timing of some expenses that pushed from Q1. We expect Q4 to be the strongest quarter of the year due to higher systems sales. We're lowering our net cash guidance by $100 million to a revised range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion primarily due to the incremental $150 million of capital expenditures to support the new Series 6 factory included in this year's guidance. Note that the remaining $250 million of CapEx to new factory is expected to be incurred in 2019. Operating cash flow is $100 million lower due to the updates we're making to the Beryl project, which was originally assumed to be sold as an unlevered asset, but will now be financed with project-level debt. This adjustment did not impact net cash as there's an offsetting financing cash inflow. Lastly, as discussed previously, the structural project sales transactions can have a significant impact on operating cash flows. In addition to the structural project sales, the timing of the sale can also have a meaningful impact on operating cash flow guidance for 2018. For example, if we sell a project later in 2018 than anticipated and a project continues to draw down debt financing in intervening periods, the operating cash flow proceeds will be lower assuming the debt is assumed by the buyer of the project. Even though the economic substance of the transaction is unchanged, the classification of the cash flows may be different and this can impact our expectations for operating cash flow for the year. Finally, turning to slide 13, I'll summarize the key messages from our call today. Firstly, as Mark discussed, we're encouraged by the continued strong market demand for our Series 6 technology. With future contracts with modules shipments of 10.6 gigawatts and potential bookings opportunities of 8.3 gigawatts, we have strong demand visibility, which enabled the decision to expand capacity. We're excited to add to our manufacturing presence in Northern Ohio and we'll continue to evaluate further expansion in the future, subject to market conditions. Secondly, we're making progress on our Series 6 ramp and we reached important milestones this month as we started production, began the first commercial shipments. Thirdly, we're pleased with the results for the quarter and the strong project sale execution and effective core OpEx management which contributed to our earnings of $0.78 per share. Our net cash position remained strong at $2.4 billion even as we continue to invest in Series 6 capacity. And lastly, we're maintaining our 2018 earnings guidance and updating our net cash guidance as a result of the new capacity expansion announcements and project sale timing. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Sophie Karp. Please go ahead. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Sophie, are you there? Ashley, if we can go to the next caller then, please. Operator : We'll take our next question from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, guys. It looks like you're making great progress on the Series 6 ramp-up. When do you expect your first third-party shipments? If you said it in your prepared remarks, sorry if I missed it. I know it's always been kind of perhaps back half of this year, but now that you have a clear line of sight to ship to your own projects, you mentioned something about certifications may slip a few weeks. Does the first shipment to third parties depend on that certification and what was that original deadline and what is that date now? And then shifting to the progress you're making on Series 6, 90% of the modules at more than 400 watts, that's fantastic. Can you give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of the cost structure and progress you're making? Back at the Analyst Day I think at year-end 2016, you talked about 40% lower than Series 4. So, is that very much on target as well? And then finally, how do you expect the bookings to trend with the success that you're having with the Series 6 ramp-up? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right. So a lot there, I'll try to hit on it. As it relate to third-party shipments for Series 6 and again we originally planned the vast majority of the early production was going to go into our own self-developed assets and that's what is happening. The shipments to third-parties really don't start to happen until really the end of the year into the November, December timeframe, where we really start to see any meaningful volume starting to go into third-party shipments. So, again, we've allowed this optionality and flexibility with our own self-developed assets to absorb the volatility potentially around the ramp and potential implications that that may have or even the timing of various certifications. As relates to the certifications, again, to the third-parties I see no impact at all of anything going to third party, but the other thing I just want to put in perspective is that we have historically and we will do it again here, effectively do in-field certification. So, we've done with this before with Series 4 and we have continued to ship, and then do the in-field certification and so the initial shipments that are going out right now to one of our self-developed assets will use that same type of methodology. So, I don't want you to feel like the timing around certification and the fact that it's slipping a little bit really will have any impact \u2013 not only won't have any impact to third-party customer shipments because they're further out on the horizon, but even to our own self-developed assets, it won't be an issue from that standpoint. Series 6 volumes are \u2013 the cost side of the equation, but for what we're seeing right now with the potential stress points on aluminum, mainly with what's going on with tariffs and, in general, commodity price increases, there's a little bit of friction from that standpoint. So if I look at it, where are we stressed a little bit on our cost per watt assumptions around Series 6 is primarily related to the frame. Beyond that, I feel very good where we are. Again, we have to get to high volume manufacturing, much higher volume manufacturing than we're in right now, which will continue to help drive costs down as well. We feel good about that. Relative to the 40%, again, that was an exit end of 2016 type of number and we feel very confident with where we'll be with Series 6 once it is fully ramped. From a booking standpoint and what that profile should look like, and when you look at it right now, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, the incremental capacity that we've now added with Series 6, plus the decision we announced last quarter to run our two lines in Perrysburg for \u2013 actually restarting them because we initially had shut them down. The combination of the two of those will give us about 1.2 gigawatts production over 2018, 2019 and 2020, which, if you look at that relative to what we said in the Analyst Day, now says that our cumulative production over that horizon is about 15 gigawatts. You pull out 500-or-so megawatts that we shipped right now through the first quarter, it says we've got another 14.5 gigawatts of production that will happen over the next several years. And against that, we have 10.6 gigawatts booked, which means we've got 4 gigawatts to continue to book. Against that number, I've got 1.2 [gigawatts] that is signed right now in our mid- to late-stage, subject to CP. So you're starting to look at a little bit north of 3 gigawatts to have everything sold through in that horizon. When I look at the north of 8 gigawatts, back out 1.2 gigawatts, that leaves me 7 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage to realize 3 gigawatts or so of additional bookings to make sure we sell through all the way through 2020. A lot of work still to be done, but could we be in a position by the end of this year that largely has gotten that accomplished and then starting to put more points on the board beyond 2020, I mean that would be the goal and there is a path to say that that could happen. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sophie Karp with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hello. Good afternoon. Can you hear me now? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes, please go ahead. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Just to follow-up on the discussion on the bookings, as you continue to book this volumes, how much of a embedded pricing risk is there? Maybe are there different contract types that you're signing and just how much of, I guess, price declines do you anticipate when you think about it? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Well, look, Sophie, the way our contracts are structured, and they have been through the horizon that we've been talking about building the contracted pipeline, is they are firm fixed prices that also become associated with some form of payment security or down payment, whether in the form of an LC or cash, or something along those lines. And they're enforceable and there's obligations of the customer to take and there's obligations of First Solar to perform relative to those contracts. There are not any price adders or deltas, per se, but for a price adder for the bin. So if we contract at a 430 watt module and we deliver a 435 watt module, then there will be a price adder. If we deliver a 425 watt module, there would be a price deduction. That's really the only variability in the ASPs, other than the bin that ultimately is delivered to the customer relative to what was contracted. And there's provisions in the contract to allow for deltas on the contracted bin. It goes up and down. Other than that, there's really no variability into the contracted ASP. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Congratulations. Can you talk a little bit about guidance? I guess you had a big beat breakdown (36:27) compared to where you thought you would be, and so you didn't raise guidance. I know there were some risks there you mentioned, but just how you think about that all. On Series 6, I think, Mark, you were talking about, basically, I mean, like huge bookings, so I think better than everyone expected, with being sold out until 2020. Now, I think the Street can look at that and say, okay, they have nothing left to do. So, I guess, how would you counter that? What are we missing maybe on the margin side or what's the next step? Are you going to expand capacity more? I'm sorry, I always do this to you, but I'll leave it there. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So, Ben, I'll start with the guidance and Mark will talk about the Series 6. So on the guidance side, we had some upside to the quarter from the settlement of the sales and use tax examination, which was in our suite of risks and opportunities for the year, but not necessarily looked at for being in Q1. So that's an upside. And that's been offset partially by, as I mentioned, we've pushed out the Beryl project. So we're currently in the sale process for that asset and we expect now to close that in 2019. Based on the current position in the sale process, we think we'll meet or potentially exceed our clients' expectations around that project. However, as we've always said, we will look to optimize total project value over making a specific quarter or even a specific year of guidance. And right now, it's looking like we can optimize value on that asset by pushing it out. We've also got a couple of risks for the year. So Mark talked a little bit about the potential impact of Series 6 around the aluminum on the frame. We're also seeing steel, aluminum costs potentially increase across the EPC business as a function of tariffs and then the ancillary impact to the pricing of exempted or non-tariff steel, aluminum as well. And then lastly we have the Ishikawa project in Japan, which has had some schedule challenges related to adverse weather, and then we have a mitigation plan and we still think we have a good path to selling that in 2018. But if you look at all of those in totality, there's a lot of variability in the guidance for the year and we think that keeping the range where it is today gives us some flexibility should we see increase in traffic costs or potentially a slip out of the Ishikawa project into next year. So that's why we're keeping guidance for the year as it is. In terms of the guidance over the year, we guided to the first half that could be about a quarter of the earnings for the year. If you look at the first quarter that we recorded, you take the sales and use tax piece out and the breakeven guidance we are giving for Q2, you go to about that same place. So guidance for the year not changed, still a lot of variability in the year. But we are pretty confident we have a good path to the bottom range of the guidance. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I'll add this to the guidance, the thing is, Ben, as you know, we're obviously going to be very prudent as it relates to when do we take up guidance. And I think we're still early in the year and there's a lot of moving pieces and we want to always reserve that optionality as it relates to capturing better value for a development asset by selling it at the optimal time to capture that value equation versus trying to make it fit into a particular quarter or year. So, we're always going to be a little bit more balanced in that regard and we'll see how the year progresses and provide an update around that in our next earnings call. As it relates to Series 6 and, look, we're very happy with the bookings and we've added more capacity now for that reason, and not only for what's contracted, but also for what sits in our development \u2013 or excuse me, our mid- to late-stage pipeline at this point in time. We're continuing to add EPC, so we're taking, we showed another 380 megawatts or so this quarter that we booked on top of a module agreement that was already contracted. We have another 500 megawatts of EPC that we'll be able to most likely add to additional volume that we have contracted modules on and we're going to continue to look to that. So that's going to be another adder. Then another piece will be O&M, on all the volume that we're talking about now close to 1 gigawatt, we've added EPC to or will add EPC to here over the next quarter or so. We're also working to add additional O&M to that scope. So another revenue stream and earnings pool that will come on top of what we've already contracted on Series 6. The other piece of it is managing OpEx and scale, and I think the thing we continue \u2013 and I want to make sure people continue to model and think through is contribution margin flow through against a relatively fixed cost OpEx. So we now have a roadmap that says, as we exit 2020, we'll be north of 7 gigawatts. And we start modeling that and looking at incremental contribution margin against a fixed cost OpEx that's relatively flat, it drives op margin expansion and EPS expansion as well. So, those are things I think that people need to look at. And the other thing I want to make sure people understand is related to Series 6. We have a lot still in front of us. We're happy with where we started at this point in time, especially on the module wattage and efficiency, I'm extremely pleased with that. The risk that we all focused on the most was the front-end of line, and the front end of line is performing extremely well. We got some issues on the back end, we're trying to work through and that's more of a throughput issue. But the reality, though, is that as you think through the entitlement around the efficiency and, ultimately, where the costs can go for Series 6, it's not done. So I know Phil asked the question around 40% lower than where we were on Series 4. There's still a meaningful opportunity to continue to drive down the costs on Series 6 and to continue to drive the efficiency up and further enhance the overall competitiveness of the product. So, those are all things that we'll give updates in the future. But if you had to ask me, maybe where people need to think about in the business model as we move forward, those are probably the main points that I'd mention. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, first off, Mark, you seem more constructive on topping the 1 gigawatt in the systems business bogey in recent quarters. I know there is some moving pieces in terms of specific projects this year. But given the recent trends and the EPC traction you're seeing, is that 1 gigawatt bogey still the right target for 2018 \u2013 maybe less 2018, but thinking about 2019 and beyond? And then, secondly, on the new Ohio plant, just a couple of modeling specifics, if you could help us out, Alex. The $100 million for this year, fair to assume the other $300 million in CapEx comes in, in 2019. And then at Analyst Day, I think, you guys had said $50 million in start-up and ramp penalty costs in each of 2019 and 2020 related to capacity expansion. How does that change with this new plant for those years? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right. I'll take the systems business question, Brian, and Alex will take the other two. Yeah, look, I'm very happy with where we are right now on the systems business. We've always said that the gigawatt is the target annually and we could trend above that number any given year and we've also said that maybe, over time, as we continue to see more progress maybe the number goes up. And what I'm seeing right now there's clearly a potential that that could happen, especially with what we're seeing in some of the international opportunities, beyond just what we're doing here in the U.S. So I think, the combination of the two says that there could be an additional upside to the systems business as we look over the horizon. And we will be selective. I mean, there is a very unique and specific opportunity set that we're going out after and where we want to position ourself in the market as well as the geographies in which we want to do development, particularly, and our systems business, in general. But subject to kind of those guardrails, I'm very happy with the systems business movement and there could be an opportunity that we'll do better than that over the next few years. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: And Brian, on the numbers, so just to clarify, it's $150 million of CapEx increase for this year and $250 million, which we'll spend in 2019, so total approximately $400 million. And on the startup side, we originally, at the Analyst Day, guided to $170 million of both ramp and startup combined in 2018 and about $50 million in 2019. We're adding $10 million to that number for 2018 today, so current guidance is $180 million combined. Now, we haven't updated for 2019 or beyond yet, and we may do so later in the year. But for now, the only update is $10 million addition to 2018. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much. Could you talk a little bit about how many new customers you booked business with this year? How many opportunities you're seeing to actually bid into products that are adding capacity on existing projects? And then, if there are any incentives to offset the incremental expense on Ohio capacity expansion. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Okay. So, Colin, on new customers, we haven't historically reported on that specifically, but what I can tell you just \u2013 I'll just use for example some of the announcements that we just made in terms of customers. The Vectren, the first deal that we've done with Vectren, Tampa Electric, which we announced the first deal a quarter or so ago. First time we've done business with Vectren, the U.S. developer that we talked about, 1.2 gigawatt that we've done 700-plus this year and 500-or-so last year. That's essentially a new customer, we really haven't done anything with that customer. When I get out into the international markets, we highlighted volumes in Turkey, which again is a customer that we haven't done a lot of volumes with in the past. Australia had some of the momentum that we got going on in Australia. We're expanding there. Japan, we're expanding there. So when I look at the profile of new customers, while we don't report on it specifically, one of the things that's enabled us to grow the pipeline that we have in terms of contracted bookings as well as the mid- to late-stage is a very diverse customer set and a lot of customers that we have not done business with historically. And part of it is because the excitement that's been created with Series 6. So the product that we have now is looked at as competitively advantaged in the marketplace. And there's even, to some extent, more of a pull versus a push with some of our customers wanting to come to us and work with First Solar because of the technology that we're bringing to market from that standpoint. I didn't understand \u2013 I also talked to the incentive question, but you said something about adding capacity. Help me understand that in terms of customer. I thought I heard you say customers adding capacity. I'm not sure of the question. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: If there's are existing sites where land has been used, what we have started to see a little bit of is folks either replacing modules or adding capacity around those existing sites within existing interconnects. So I'm just wondering if you've seen a significant amount of activity in that. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I mean, we haven't seen a lot of that. We've actually done some of that in some of the international opportunities where we found ways to add incremental DC in certain cases. Clearly, there's opportunities where customers have done development of particular site and the interconnect's been sized to something that's larger than the actual capacity that was being built in the first phase and then gets expanded beyond that. So, those really do happen from time to time. As it relates to any potential repowering, at least from a First Solar perspective, we haven't seen much of that all. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, Colin, on the Ohio side, so the range of state and county level local incentives, we haven't listed exactly what those are. But they include a range of job creation incentives, training incentives, sales and property tax abatements, most of which have been largely finalized, but have potentially got either local voters or things to completely finalize those. So they're largely in place, and there's a wide range. The other thing I'd say is that one of the reasons we can expand U.S. manufacturing capacity is associated with the lower corporate tax rate, and tax reform. And part of that tax reform has been the ability to immediately expense sales or equipment, so less a direct incentive, but also another reason that's made this more competitive relative to international manufacturing. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. And what I said in my comments as well, I mean, look, the relative competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing right now is really exciting to me and really to some extent overwhelmingly in terms of its relative position. It's not just the corporate tax rate and incentive and everything else that have been brought to the table, but just the labor productivity and advantages that we can get here in the U.S. relative to what we can see in some of the international markets, and just the general support we can get at the state level or the federal level support with the tax structure or whatever it may be. U.S. manufacturing coupled with our Series 6 product that \u2013 less labor content per module, it's very competitive to do U.S. manufacturing right now, and it also helps us reduce the logistics, the freight costs, delivering to customers here in the U.S., our ability to serve our customers more timely and responsiveness around that, and we're very happy about the ability to add more manufacturing capacity in the U.S. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about the state and local incentives and when do you think they might start to flow in for the new factory? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So Michael, there is not much update I can give you beyond the range of those, they're in the process of being finalized. But we'll update you further on later call as we get more clarity. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah, the other thing \u2013 I mean I would just say, to some extent, some of the incentives that we're getting are comparable to the incentives we would have had when we first started manufacturing in Ohio. And a lot of them will relate to property tax abatements and other reductions that will happen over time. So the numbers, when we're actually able to communicate them, they'll be a large number, but in aggregate. But you also have to look at the timeline of which you'll see the benefit, they'll carry on for many years. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Edwin Mok with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Edwin Mok - Needham & Company, LLC: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. So I guess two last questions, first, on the new U.S. capacity, I think you talked about like higher automation for Series 6 and, therefore, lower labor costs. But then I would suspect there may be some higher potential other things that might be higher costs, I guess. Is that what you're thinking about? Is it more costly to produce here or is it less costly to produce here? And then having that additional capacity in U.S., does it help you be more aggressive on bidding for system projects? And then just one quick question on OpEx, if you take up your OpEx start-up costs by $10 million, then you will actually lower your OpEx for the year, right, excluding start-up costs. Is that correct? And kind of to Mark's point about leveraging the model long term, is this like $283 million (52:48) OpEx a level that you think you can sustain even as you ramp to that 7 gigawatt of capacity that you eventually will be selling? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So I'll let Alex take a handful of them. I will just kind of the first one as it relates to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. Yes, Series 6 is lower labor content per module produced. So that helps relative \u2013 and again, you have better labor productivity in the U.S., so a combination of less labor content and then better productivity effectively creates almost a level playing field with our manufacturing in Vietnam and Malaysia. The other thing that we get though is localization of the supply chain. And so having a local supply chain now that we have higher production volumes that we can run through their supply chain, which drives economies of scale to our suppliers which enables them to further reduce their costs, which drivers flow through benefit to First Solar is extremely impactful as well. And you couple that with lower freight cost to deliver to customers. And then the reality is that, yes, while we have a tax holiday in Malaysia, when you look through that holiday period and you look at the normalized U.S. tax rate relative to the normalized Malaysia or Vietnam tax rate, it's favorable from that standpoint. So there's many different aspects that has enhanced the overall competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. And like I said, we're very happy to be able to expand manufacturing in Ohio. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: So, for the Series 6 in Ohio directly impacts our recent bid (54:22) on systems projects. I don't know that having more U.S. manufacturing relative to other international manufacturing changes our ability to be on the systems side. I would say overall Series 6 is a very competitive product and having that product enables us to be more competitive in systems business, be it domestically or internationally. But one of the key things that we talked about OpEx on scale. So, yes, we're going to be up about $10 million of start-up this year, which does mean we are managing our core SG&A effectively that will be down slightly from previous guidance. This year we're going to be running still at around $0.10 per watt of OpEx. And if you look at our growth over time we aim to grow the company at 7-plus gigawatts of capacity without significant increases in OpEx. So, there'll be a minimal increases around some of our variable costs including sales expense. But outside of that, we would look to bring that number down by 50% or more to get down to, call it, a $0.05 per watt of OpEx number out when we're at that kind of 7 gigawatt range. And also remember that when we talk about that OpEx number we're including freight and warranty in that number, which is not the same if you look at most of our competitors. So, to do apples-to-apples comparison, you'd have to strip that out of our number. So, as Mark mentioned, there's clear value in scaling and the benefits of OpEx in the incremental contribution margin that we can get through managing that OpEx profile carefully.

Strouse - JPMorgan Securities LLC Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Abby. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Following their remarks, we'll then have time for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by discussing the global PV market. As you are aware, since our last earnings call, there has been significant developments in the global market, primarily stemming from policy decisions in China. The near-term impact has been an almost immediate collapse and probably seen across the crystalline silicon supply chain. While we have seen planned maintenance pull forward or other actions taken to better align near-term supply with demand, there's still an oversupply across the value chain which is driving declining module ASPs in both China and certain international markets. While it's still too early to fully assess the long-term effect these decisions will have on industry as a whole, the end result most likely will be more competitive PV power prices which will lead to demand elasticity both in China specifically and the global market in general. Additionally, we will likely see industry consolidation as uncompetitive technologies and financially unstable companies struggle to compete. While we will continue to carefully monitor these recent developments, we remain focused on leveraging our competitive advantages and executing our differentiation strategy. First and foremost, our cad-tel technology and specifically our Series 6 product is a competitive advantage. In an industry that suffers from a lack of differentiation, Series 6 has the potential to achieve a distinctive combination of low cost and high efficiency. While there is still a great deal of work ahead to realize its full potential, our unique technology is a key competitive advantage. In addition, as we look over the horizon of an oversupplied market, our nearly 11-gigawatt pipeline of future contracted shipments is a position of strength. While I will talk more about this in a moment, nearly 80% of our available supply from now until the end of 2020 is booked. This is a substantial pipeline of contracted volume that provides good visibility to future demand at an uncertain time in the market. Finally, another competitive advantage unmatched in the industry is our balance sheet which enables us to invest in our business and be opportunistic at a time when greater stress is likely to be placed on competitors who are already highly levered. Our net cash at the end of Q2 was a record $2.7 billion, even after significant year-to-date investments in Series 6 capacity and project development activities. While this is an industry that has experienced periods of overcapacity and difficult market conditions in the past, the long-term potential for solar energy still shines brightly. Furthermore, as a company, we have never been better positioned to deal with the current near-term challenges given our Series 6 product, contracted bookings and balance sheet strength. Before providing an update on our progress related to Series 6, there are some important points to keep in mind pertaining to our financial results for Q2. First is that when we began our transition to Series 6, a year and a half ago, we anticipated that 2018 and in particular the first half would be the trough in our earnings power. With Series 6 production largely slated for the second half of the year, we knew we would be at the low point of our module availability in a period with elevated levels of ramp and startup costs. Additionally, the second quarter was significantly impacted by the timing of closing of certain project assets. As we've seen in the past, there is a great deal of uncertainty associated with project sale timing and the effects on a single quarter can be pronounced. Given this quarterly variability, we provide financial guidance on an annual basis as we believe this is the most meaningful way to evaluate our performance. Lastly, certain initial Series 6 production issues that we have experienced during Q2 impacted our results. Lower than targeted throughput and yields resulted in fewer module available at project sites and a higher module cost per watt. While we see these ramps related impact primarily as near-term issues rather as long-term structural challenges, they nonetheless cause a delay in some project revenue recognition and resulted in a decrease in our full year margin outlook. Alex will provide discussion around the financial results in more detail later and provide an update to guidance. Now turning to slide 4, I'll provide some more context related to our Series 6 ramp and the manufacturing issues mentioned. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we have made thus far and remain confident of the long-term capability of the Series 6 product from a cost and an efficiency perspective. To give you a sense of the progress we are making, at the time of our last update in April, we had only recently started production and initial commercial shipments from our Ohio factory. Since that time, we have commenced production at our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia with our third Series 6 factor in Vietnam not far behind. In Vietnam, we are completing factory acceptance tests of the equipment, and we expect the first module production in late Q3 with commercial shipments to follow in early Q4. Construction of our second Series 6 factory in Vietnam is also progressing according to schedule with tool installations beginning later this quarter followed by first production in 2019. In the U.S., we are progressing with our second Series 6 factory that we announced on our previous earnings call. We held the groundbreaking event for the new factory in early June and the 1.2 gigawatt nameplate factory is anticipated to commence production in late 2019. Overall, there has been significant progress made in the past three months and the organization is intently focused on building out our (07:22) capacity. As it pertains to the manufacturing ramp of our Ohio and Malaysia factories, we have made substantial progress over the past 90 days. Production at the Ohio factory is now running at approximately 60% of nameplate capacity and our Malaysia factory has ramped very rapidly to over 40% of nameplate. However, even with this progress, the planned Q2 production was below our expectations. Our biggest challenge remains the throughput on the back-end of the line bustling (07:54) through final pack out. The layout at the back-end of the line was built according to the tool set availability specification which resulted in few required buffers. As we started to ramp the back-end of the line with a tool set availability not yet at a mature state, we realized there were multiple single points of failure in the line that could shut down production. Effectively, the line was not adequately buffered given the current format of the tool set. We are in the process of installing inventory accumulators to properly buffer the back-end of the line. Once completed in our Ohio factory, we will use our Copy Smart approach to roll out to Malaysia and Vietnam. Over time, as the tool set availability improves, while the inventory accumulators will remain in place, the need for inventory buffers will decline. The impact of reevaluating the back-end, identifying the required buffers and installing the inventory accumulators across our manufacturing facilities in addition to adversely impacting Q2 has resulted in a reduction of approximately 200 megawatts to the full year Series 6 production plan. It is important to note that despite the 2018 volume reduction, with the actions we are taking we anticipate to exit the year at the originally anticipated throughput levels and enter 2019 on track to our previously announced Series 6 production volume. Keep in mind that the issues we're working through do not impact our long-term outlook for Series 6. Relative to our long-term expectations, I wanted to make a comment on the toolset which incorporates approximately 200 tools across the front-end and the back-end. Through our initial production, we have validated a cycle time in performance of each tool and the capabilities meet or exceed our plan requirements. This validation helps to critically inform our views on long-term expectations. Module wattage continued to improve steadily and is currently averaging 415 watts per module as compared to a production entitlement that yielded most modules near 400 watts at the end of our last call. Our top bins are currently at 420 watts per module and are approaching 425 watts. With a robust pipeline of advancement to come, we have line-of-sight to continue improvement in the fleet average efficiency. Overall, our efficiency and watts per module are on track relative to our expectations for the year. Series 6 product readiness has taken a significant step forward since last quarter with the completion of both UL and IEC certifications. We indicated previously that achieving these certifications was primarily a matter of time and completing both certification is an important milestone. We have not yet scored this metric green as a matter of due course given the relatively recent introduction of the Series 6 product. As we gain more experience throughout this year, we expect to advance this metric to green. Continuing on slide 5, our higher (10:46) bookings activity for the past quarter. Since our last call, bookings have continued to be solid as we have contracted nearly 900-megawatts of new business. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 4.1 gigawatts and our total future expected shipments to 10.9 gigawatts. To put our future expected shipments into context, almost the entire 10.9 gigawatts is expected to ship between now and the end of 2020. Given this same time period, our anticipated supply of both Series 4 and Series 6 modules is 13.8 gigawatts which implies approximately 2.9 gigawatts remaining bookings to fully contract through the end of 2020. Factoring in the over 750 megawatts of contract signed, but not yet counted as bookings, the remaining bookings number to the end of 2020 drops to less than 2.2 gigawatts. While we still have considerable work ahead to fully contract the remaining 2.9 gigawatts of supply, we currently have 5.1 gigawatts of mid to late stage opportunities with shipment requirements before the end of 2020. An important element to highlight relative to our year-to-date bookings is both the stability of our Series 6 pricing and the pricing advantage of Series 6 versus Series 4. For example, the average ASP of Series 6 modules booked this year is essentially consistent with the 2017 Series 6 bookings average module ASP. Note this is especially noteworthy given the current year bookings offer shipments through the end of 2020. Furthermore, when compared to 2018 Series 6 and Series 4 bookings, Series 6 average ASP is 6% higher than Series 4. We're also continuing to make progress in building our systems pipeline as we highlighted by two new PPAs we booked in the U.S. One PPA for 75 megawatt AC was awarded by utility in California and has an expected completion date in 2021. A second PPA for 73 megawatt AC was obtained through a recent pipeline acquisition and will be our first project in South Carolina. The PPA is with South Carolina Electric & Gas and the project has an expected completion date of 2020. We're excited by this entry into a new part of the Southeast United States and a region that has an excellent solar resource. While this was the only project acquired with a signed PPA, the pipeline acquired also includes a number of mid to late stage opportunity development projects, which in aggregate total approximately 600 megawatts. As I mentioned earlier, our balance sheet strength allows us to be opportunistic. We will continue to evaluate other project or pipeline acquisition opportunities so long as they meet our return thresholds. While not yet counted as bookings, we have also signed an approximately 60 megawatt AC PPA with a utility in Western United States for a project that will provide power to a corporate customer. We'll provide more details in the future, but this project is a prime example of our capabilities to address the renewable energy goals of corporations and partnership with utilities by leveraging efficient and reliable large scale off-site generation. Previously, we're able to bring these same capabilities to bear when we partnered with NV Energy to power data centers for switch with clean affordable electricity. In addition to the signed PPA, we are in advanced discussions with utilities for two additional projects that would supply over 100 megawatts AC of power to corporate customers. All three of these opportunities highlight this important growth opportunity as many companies increasingly commit to 100% clean energy. Outside the U.S., we also continue to see growth in our systems portfolio this past quarter with approximately 30 megawatts AC of additional systems bookings in Australia. In addition to new development project bookings, we also recently converted an additional 65 megawatt DC of previously contracted module line to an EPC sale. When we add EPC scope to previously booked module sales, we do not count these agreements as new bookings. However, they do provide incremental future revenue and margin. This is the fourth project that we will construct for Tampa Electric with an expected completion date of this project in 2019. Year-to-date, our total net system bookings are now 1.3 gigawatts which comprises of over 750 megawatts of development project bookings and more than 500 megawatts of EPC contracts which we converted from module sales. In addition to the system projects discussed, the remaining bookings for the quarter were module sales primarily to customers in the U.S. Other module agreements were also signed with customers in India, the Middle East and Europe. Continuing on to slide 6, I'll next discuss our mid to late stage bookings opportunities which on a net basis is unchanged at 8.3 gigawatt DC. When factoring in the bookings for the quarter, a number of which were included as opportunities in the prior quarter, our mid to late stage pipeline actually grew. On a geographical basis, North America increased with a roughly corresponding decrease in opportunities in Asia Pacific. North America increased primarily as a result of acquiring the project development portfolio in the Southeast U.S. mentioned previously. Keep in mind in addition to the more advanced project opportunities which are included in the 8.3 gigawatts, there is a robust portfolio of early stage projects not reflected here. Similar to last quarter, the total potential opportunities include deals that are signed but not yet counted as bookings until financing or other CPs are closed. As mentioned, there are over 750 megawatts of such projects, including the PPA with the Western utility already discussed. With respect to the expected shipments timing of the mid to late stage opportunities, we have 5.1 gigawatts of opportunities in 2019 and 2020 against the remaining supply in this time period of 2.9 gigawatts. Early stage projects not included in this number provide additional opportunity to sell the remaining volume. Next, I'll provide an update in progress we are making on our systems project pipeline. As we discussed at our Analyst Day last December, the systems business remains a core part of our strategy and on average we are targeting around 1 gigawatt per year of developed business in the next few years. As it pertains to development, we remain focused on key markets such as the United States, Japan and Australia where we can pursue a differentiated strategy that can lead to capturing value and compelling returns. Select EPC opportunities in the U.S. will also remain a priority as these agreements enable greater customer engagement and we believe enhance our value proposition for utilities wanting to own their own generation. As highlighted on slide 7, we're making good progress towards achieving our annual development target. Note that the timing of revenue recognition on system project will vary from the shipment timing shown on the slide. However, it is a good indication of the current status. As illustrated, we have nearly reached the 1 gigawatt target in 2019 with contracted development projects. And we have the potential to exceed that market where we were able to close the mid to late stage opportunity shown. Both EPC projects plus potential EPC conversion opportunities take that toll even higher. In 2020, we're more than halfway to our target with the potential to significantly exceed that market. Keep in mind that there are always contracting risks associated with mid to late stage projects and we do not expect that we'll ultimately book all of this mid to late stage opportunities shown. However, this does highlight our progress on building our systems business over the next few years. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Before discussing the quarter in detail, there are some key points to note as it relates to the first half of the year. From the outset of the Series 6 transition, we anticipated that this timeframe will be the lowest point of our earnings power due to lower module production levels and elevated startup expenses and ramp costs. In Q2, these expected elements combined with a quarter of unusually low sales. This is due to both the aforementioned Series 6 throughput and yield issues which impacted module cost and availability for projects already sold as well as to a delay in closing certain new project sales. Despite these challenges, we've been able to maintain our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year while implementing plans that fully address these early stage manufacturing ramp challenges. It's also worth noting that in our February earnings call, we guided to an expectation of approximately 25% of our full year earnings being recognized in the first half of the year. With year-to-date EPS of $0.32, we are tracking slightly behind our expected earnings distribution across the year but remain on track to achieve our full-year earnings per share guidance. Turning to slide 9, I'll start by discussing selected income statement items for the quarter. Q2 net sales were $309 million, a decrease of $258 million compared to the previous quarter. Systems revenue as a percentage of total quarterly net sales decreased slightly to 66% in Q2 versus 72% in Q1. As indicated, the lower net sales in Q2 resulted from certain project sales pushing out of the quarter, lower revenue recognition on projects already sold, and a decrease in third-party module sales due to shipment timing. As it pertains to the timing of system sales, we indicated on the Q1 call there was potential for a significant impact Q2 earnings if the closing of certain project sales moved out of the quarter. While we saw delays in the sale of two projects, in both cases this is only a timing impact and in neither case do anticipate any impact to overall project economics as a result of this change in timing. With regards to revenue recognition on projects already sold, various issues with the California Flats project were the main reason for lower than expected revenue in Q2. Firstly, Series 6 module availability constraints due to both throughput constraints and delays in the release of module shipments pending final product certifications limited the amount of work that could be completed on the project. Secondly, there was a small decrease in the project size due to lower than planned module bin classes. While we'll still be installing the same number of modules as initially planned, the lower wattage per module results in a lower total DC capacity. Thirdly, the cost plan for the project was increased due to both higher module costs and acceleration costs resulting from the timing of module shipments. The combination of these factors serves to decrease total expected project revenue and increase total expected costs which reduce both the project percentage of completion from work performed in Q2 as well as leading to a Q2 adjustment if the project to-date is revenue recognized. Second quarter gross margin was negative 3%. The module segment was impacted negatively by low sales volume and ramp related costs. Bear in mind that the module segment sales is composed entirely of Series 4 volume as already Series 6 volume is entirely allocated to our systems business. However the module segment COGS is comprised of both Series 4 COGS and Series 6 ramp related costs as these are allocated to the module segment. In Q2, the module segment was burdened by over $20 million of ramp costs as well as several million of scrap charges related to initial Series 6 production. Note that for the full year, we still expect ramp costs to be approximately $60 million. And during the period, while we're ramping our new technology, we expect to see continued noise between our two reporting segments. The systems segment gross margin was affected by the change in estimate for California Flats revenue and cost plan mentioned earlier as well as the higher mix of revenue from EPC projects versus development assets. Q2 operating expenses were $96 million, a decrease of $3 million compared to last quarter. Plant start-up expenses decreased by $13 million as a result of lower Series 6 pre-production activities in Ohio partially offset by increases in the Malaysia and Vietnam factories. The decrease in start-up expense was partially offset by higher SG&A. Our Q2 operating loss was $104 million compared to an operating profit of $74 million in the first quarter. The Q2 loss was primarily a result of the unusually low sales, impacts of gross margin for over $20 million of ramp cost, and more than $24 million of plant start-up expense. There was an income tax benefit of $6 million in Q2 as compared to a tax expense of $12 million in Q1. As it relates to U.S. tax reform enacted last December, we did not record any adjustments in Q2 related to our original estimates. However, as a reminder, we continue to evaluate our provisional estimates until we file our 2017 federal tax return later this year. The sale of our ownership interest in 8point3 closed in the second quarter and we recorded a gain on the sale that resulted in Q2 equity and earnings net of tax of $40 million. The combination of the aforementioned items resulted in a net loss for the second quarter of $0.46 per share compared to earnings per share of $0.78 in Q1. Moving to slide 10, I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at $3.1 billion, an increase of $256 million from the prior quarter. We had a record net cash position of $2.7 billion at the end of Q2, a sequential increase of $238 million. The higher cash balance is primarily use of proceeds from the sale of our interest in 8point3, partially offset by capital expenditures to support our ongoing Series 6 capacity expansion. Pertaining to the sale of 8point3, we received net proceeds of $240 million after the payment of fees and other amounts. In addition, we collected the remaining outstanding balance of $48 million associated with a promissory note that was issued when interest in the Desert Stateline project was sold to 8point3. Second quarter net working capital, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes the cash and marketable securities, decreased by approximately $230 million. The change was primarily due to the collection of accounts receivables and an increase in deferred revenue from module prepayments, partially offset by an increase in inventories. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $456 million, a net increase of $18 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily associated with issuing project-level debt in Australia. And as a reminder, essentially all of our outstanding debt is project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the projects are sold. Cash flows from operations were $129 million due to the collection of accounts receivable and the receipt of module sale prepayments. Cash received for the sale of our interests in 8point3 and the repayment of the Stateline promissory note will classify as investing cash flows. Capital expenditures were $195 million in the second quarter compared to $178 million in the prior quarter. The cumulative spend on Series 6 capacity is now approximately $800 million out of a total expected spend of around $1.8 billion, the 6.6 gigawatts of capacity. And lastly, depreciation and amortization expense was $30 million in Q2 versus $24 million last quarter. Continuing on to slide 11, I'll next discuss our updated 2018 guidance. Before discussing the specific updates, there are some key points and assumptions to highlight. Firstly, we have narrowed our sales guidance range to reflect the impact of some systems revenue recognition moving into 2019. As mentioned previously, this timing of new project sales has no expected impact on the overall economics of these projects. We're lowering our expected gross margin range to reflect 2018 cost impacts, including Series 6 cost per watt increases mostly associated with aluminium cost to the module frame as well as increased POS costs. And we see offsetting non-operating impacts result in maintaining full year EPS guidance. Secondly, it's important to reiterate certain risks we highlighted on our last earnings call with regards to our Ishikawa project in Japan. Our full year guidance continues to assume the project is sold in 2018. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, the project experienced weather-related construction delays earlier this year from which it is not fully recovered. We continue to work through a mitigation plan and to see progress in construction but there remains substantial risk as to whether the sale will be completed this year. Given the size of this project and the expectation of the sale and therefore initial revenue recognition will occur near to or at COD of the project. We believe it is prudent to highlight the risk. If the project sale does move into 2019, we continue to expect there would not be any change in the anticipated project economics. However, this change in timing to a 2019 sale would likely result in 2018 revenue and earnings near the low end of our guidance ranges. And, thirdly, as it relates to the distribution of earnings between the third and fourth quarters, we expect Q4 to be the strongest quarter of the year from a revenue and earnings standpoint. We expect the remaining earnings for the year to be split approximately one-third, two-thirds across Q3 and Q4. Having discussed some of the key assumptions underlying our guidance, I'll now cover the specific updates to the ranges. Starting with net sales, we're narrowing the range to a revised forecast of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in order to reflect a revised timing of revenue recognition on certain systems project. Note this is not an overall reduction to expected systems revenue but rather a shift in timing between 2018 and 2019. Our expected gross margin has been lowered by 100 basis points to a revised range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Reduction accounts for the increase in module cost per watt and changes to the California Flats revenue and cost plan discussed. The operating expense forecast, which includes plant start-up, has been lowered by $10 million to a revised range of $390 million to $400 million. Plant start-up expense is unchanged at $120 million and the reduction is a reflection of our ongoing management of core operating expenses. Our outlook for operating income has been revised down by $15 million at the midpoint to a new range of $120 million to $160 million as a result of the lower revenue and gross margin, partly offset by the reduction in operating expenses. Below operating income, we've increased our forecast for net interest income as well as increasing our forecast full-year tax expense to approximately $35 million, a result of jurisdictional mix of income. Our guidance also assumes minimal additional equity and earnings for the balance of the year. Putting these revisions together, our earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at $1.50 to $1.90. The operating cash flow range has been increased by $100 million as a result of the revised timing of project development spending and expected improvements in module accounts receivable collection. As are reminder, both the structure of project sales and the timing of the sale can have a meaningful impact on our operating cash flow guidance. As we discussed last quarter, if we sell a project later in 2018 than anticipated and the project continues to draw down debt financing in intervening periods, operating cash flow proceeds will be lower assuming the debt is assumed by the buyer of the project. With Ishikawa and other international project sales expected in the second half of this year, we could have some revisions to our operating cash flow expectations, even when the economic substance of transactions are unchanged. Capital expenditures have been reduced by $50 million to a revised range of $800 million to $900 million, primarily due to timing of Series 6 spend and reductions in non-Series 6 CapEx. As a result of the higher operating cash flow and lower capital expenditures, we're raising our net cash guidance by $200 million to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. And our shipment guidance range has been lowered by 100 megawatts to a revised range of 2.8 gigawatts to 2.9 gigawatts to reflect the 200 megawatt reduction Series 6 shipments, partially offset by an increase in Series 4. And, finally, turning to slide 12, I'll summarize the key messages from our call today. Firstly, while there have been immediate impacts to module pricing in international markets from the recent policy decisions in China, we remain focused on executing our strategy. Our differentiated technology in Series 6 product, our strong contracted bookings and our unique financial strength allows us to thrive even in market conditions that may prove challenging for competitors. Secondly, whilst our second quarter results were impacted by Series 6 ramp related issues of module availability, factory throughput, and higher cost per watt, we've maintained our earnings guidance for 2018 and to not foresee these issues having longer-term impacts to Series 6 cost, efficiency or capacity. With module wattage that is currently at 420 watts on our top bins, improving throughput levels and a third factory that is expected to start production later this quarter, we're encouraged by the positive Series 6 momentum. And, lastly, we continue to make solid progress in booking new business as evidenced by the approximately 900 megawatts of new volume contracted since our prior earnings call and total future contracted shipments of 10.9 gigawatts. In particular, with recent PPA awards, we continue to make good headway in building a systems portfolio that we expect to average approximately 1 gigawatt per year over the next few years. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : And we will take our first question from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mark W. Strouse - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Mark Strouse on for Paul. So I actually like to start with \u2013 so you disclosed you'd booked a little less than 1 gig since the last earnings call. But are you able to say what the bookings had been since the Chinese policy announcement change? And maybe if you can give details on that, just kind of anything high level you can say regarding customers potentially holding off on projects, just kind of waiting to see what the floor and pricing ultimately will be. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, if you look at what we highlighted on the earnings presentation deck, just from the end of quarter since June, right, so we're 26 days into it, we booked 400 megawatts of volume. So, of the 900, 400 was booked in the month of July. The 500 before that \u2013 a high percentage that also was booked in the month of June. So, there was only about a month between our last earnings call and when policy decision was made which effectively was May 31. So, we have been continuing to see good momentum. Actually I was dealing with our Head of Sales, Chief Commercial Officer today and he's got customers in and given us a list of opportunities which they need modules for. And we're actively engaged in that conversation for hundreds of megawatts for this particular customer. So, I haven't seen at least at this point in time yet a meaningful slowdown. You can also see it in our mid to late stage opportunities that we've highlighted. We still have over 8 gigawatts of opportunities sitting there. So, that hasn't come down. And we're seeing a lot a lot of opportunity on the PPA side. So, we're bidding actively. We're seeing a number of PPA particularly here in the U.S. relatively successful on what we've seen so far. Obviously it's a very competitive environment for PPAs on the development side and you're not going to have a very high hit rate but relatively pleased with that activity. And we are putting some points on the board as we highlighted on the call of 750 megawatts or so, so far on the development side. And we've got a number that we've been shortlisted on and we're in active negotiations with customers to finalize some PPAs that we'll hopefully be able to report on the next earnings call. So, generally it's still doing pretty good. Now that's the U.S. market. As you get outside the U.S. market, I would say there's probably more of a pause of wait and see maybe a little bit. Clearly, after the announcement was made, we saw ASPs drop very quickly, started to see them stabilize a little bit but clearly there are some customers now that probably will wait and sort of see when it plays out over the next couple of quarters and see where PPA prices go. The nice thing about us, we don't necessarily have to engage. If we have an opportunity with the module in an environment that we're very well positioned because of the energy advantage with our temperature and spectral response advantages, we'll engage opportunistically and selectively and we'll make sure we get the right ASPs. But we're in a good position right now relative to the uncertainty of the market. Operator : Our next question will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, Mark, Alex. Thanks for the questions. In your prepared remarks, you guys had talked about some issues with throughput and yields. I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on each. So as it relates to throughput you talked about Ohio I think being at 60% and Malaysia being at 40%. And I know you plan to be at 100% by year-end or at least that's what it sounded like based on what you had been saying. But could Ohio or Malaysia be at 100% earlier, so can we see that perhaps in Q3? And it sounds like it's a framing back-end issue there. As it relates to (37:22), sorry, Mark, you had mentioned that the fleet average is 415 watts now. Do you expect the fleet average \u2013 what do you expect it to be in Q3 and in Q4? And how do you expect your efficiencies to progress? Because we had been, in some of our checks, seeing that you're actually perhaps improving faster than expected but wanted to get a feel for if there's a step function change that we could see ahead or should we expect a more kind of continuous kind of gradual improvement here? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I'll take the throughput question first. And again the issue that we're having is really around \u2013 it's the back-end and it relates to the availability of the toolset, right. So, when you look at the toolset and if you say what are the most critical components to ensure full entitlement of the nameplate capacity that we need to achieve there's really three components. And when I look at it from the standpoint of order of importance, the first two and most important is really going to be cycle time on the tool and performance on the tool. Those are critical. So, if we aren't hitting cycle time and if we aren't getting the performance out of the tool, there isn't a lot that we can do to try to help enable that, right, other than redesigning tools or other issues that we have to think about to sort of address both of those. Cycle time and performance around the toolset from the front-end all the way through the back-end is at or better than our expectations. So, that's extremely important. The third component that we look to for the toolset is the overall availability. And the overall availability at mature state will specify capability around the tool. We believe the overall availability will still enable us to get to where we need to but we're not at a mature state yet with the toolset. And the way we manage through that is we're putting buffers into the back-end of the manufacturing process. So, think about it as we have a single point of failure on the production line today. If that tool goes down, everything upstream is shutting down and we're starting the downstream processing, right? So, that tool is critical because it's a single point of failure. We have to have the availability and we've identified where those points are and what we're going to do is we'll buffer it with inventory. So, if the particular tool goes down, we are starving the balance of the production and we can continue to run the production as an example, right? Now, when I look at the tool capability \u2013 if I look at Perrysburg as an example, we've had a number of times where we are running at effectively 90% to close to 100% of nameplate capacity at that particular time and we measure it in hour increments. So, we'll look at hour increments of production and we'll say, what is the output that we achieved during that particular hour? We can have multiple hours, two, three, even four hours where we're running effectively at nameplate capacity. But then something goes down. And soon as that single point of failure occurs, we will see the production go from almost 100% of capacity down to 20% of capacity, right? And so, that's what we're working through and we've redesigned and we've put some buffers in the back-end of the line that will help address that and will enable us when we do have an event occur as we continue to ramp-up the toolset availability to its full entitlement that we won't have the adverse impact that we're seeing right now as it relates to throughput. And we're working through that right now. We won't have all of the buffers in the inventory in place until probably end of Q3, more or less the beginning of Q4. So we will continue to see a little bit of headwind and that's why we've reflected that in the reduction to the production plan. And then once we do Perrysburg, we'll replicate all of that as we roll out into KLM and Vietnam. So that's the story around throughput. And we will get to where we need to be at the end of the year. It's just a matter of addressing the issues that I highlighted. As it relates to efficiency, we're starting to touch a 425 watt bin which is really important. And we will continue to see, from the average right now of 415, we'll see that step up and then to 420 and then ultimately up to 425 to get closer to the average. I will say one thing though that the impact of the throughput, we have not prioritized \u2013 we refer to them as ETAs, so engineering tests that we do. We have prioritized throughput to ETAs and ETAs will also be helpful as we optimize and drive efficiency up. So we haven't got the full foot on the gas pedal yet on all the activities that we need to do to drive the efficiency side of the equation because, again, we're prioritizing the throughput over running some ETAs that will help us on the efficiency side. But, again, steady progression, real happy with 415, progressing towards 420 as we get into the next quarter, love the fact we're starting to touch 425. But I think that's how we ought to think about it as we move through the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe the first one is just on the manufacturing, given the pricing collapse you referred to, Mark, and the fact that Series 6 is pricing higher than Series 4. Just wondering if it makes sense or if you're contemplating any shifts specifically to Malaysia, the one facility you haven't committed to a timeframe for shifting from Series 4 to Series 6. Does that potentially get accelerated and come offline sooner given the cyclical dynamic we have here? And then just a follow-up would be around just cost competitiveness here again on that same topic. We're seeing global module ASPs trending toward the mid-$0.20 per watt range. I think there's a general assumption in the marketplace that your targeted cost per watt for Series 6 will be in the low $0.20 per watt when fully ramped in mid to late 2019. Correct me if I'm wrong on the timing. But what are you kind of thinking in terms of what your cost advantage versus peers looks like given real-time pricing? Has that potentially shrunk versus your original base case assumptions? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'll just talk through on the prioritization, how we think about Series 4 production in KLM 1, 2. We are looking \u2013 we are continuing to reassess and evaluate not for the horizon through 2020. We're looking and spending time on it. How do we best position the most competitive posture that we can have as we enter into 2021? And so, what we're thinking through is, what are all the critical dependencies knowing the uncertainty that 2021 can have? And as we continue to book our volumes up through 2020, we're looking across that horizon out beyond 2020, into 2021, in particular. And, ideally, we're going to want as much Series 6 production as possible. Scale is going to be important. We got to get to efficiency and the cost entitlements where we need to be and Series 6 is going to be a critical enabler of that. So as we think through those various levers, we will continue to evaluate our current commitment around Series 4 and the timeline of which we'll run production in particular to KLM 1, 2 relative to opportunity to drive more Series 6 volume into 2021. So still to be determined. We haven't made any conclusions. We're happy with what we have booked for that business right now but \u2013 for that volume. So we'll continue to evaluate that, again, more from how do we best position ourself for success long-term into 2021 and beyond. As it relates to cost competitiveness, what we assumed when we did our analysis, and again, I also want to make sure that when you think about that $0.25 number that you referenced, you got to add $0.02 or so, compare that to our $0.20 or what people think the numbers are, the low 20s, right? So, let's \u2013 or you take $0.02 off my number. I don't care how you look at it, right? If it's $0.25 for them, we're at $0.18 or if you're targeting us at $0.20 and their $0.25 becomes $0.27. So, make sure that's in your math and a lot of times people don't always include the logistics costs and the warranty costs. That number is relatively in line, maybe $0.01 or $0.02 lower than what we had assumed when we did our business case around Series 6 and where we thought we could get in the competitive position that would create for us. And the other side of that equation you got to keep in mind is the energy upside. So, we'll capture it and we'll be cost advantaged and we'll have the energy upside and we'll capture the value on that side of the ledger as well. So, yeah, the market is (46:25-46:29) and we're positioning ourself for long-term success and we're very happy with what Series 6 will enable for us. Operator : Our next question will come from David Katter with Baird. Please go ahead. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is Ben for David. How are you guys? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Hey, Ben. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hey. I just wanted to make sure I heard something correctly. So, you said that you signed the new bookings which were small, and maybe you can talk about why \u2013 I guess because they're so far out in the future, but they were at the same ASP as (47:07) before Series 6. Is that what you said? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Ben, it's really hard to hear. What we said \u2013 the comments I made in my prepared remarks were the bookings that we're seeing right now on year-to-date on Series 6 is about 6% higher than what we have booked on Series 4. So think about it adding $0.02 or so, right? If you think about where the ASPs are, the ASPs on Series 6 is about $0.02 or so higher than Series 4. And remember, Series 6 is about 40% lower costs. So when you combine the two and you look at the margin entitlement, the fact we're capturing the upside on ASP which we knew we would with the larger form factor and quality of the product and still enable that lower cost entitlement, I think, we're very happy with what we're seeing so far. The other thing I said is that the ASPs that we're recognizing in 2018 are essentially consistent with what we recognized in 2017 but the volume that we're booking this year is carrying us further out. We're booking 2018 volumes that are carrying us into 2020. We didn't book as much volume in 2017 for 2020's shipments. And so as you would normally expect, further out in the horizon, ASPs would trend down a little bit. But I'm very happy that we got a relatively consistent ASP in 2018, similar to what we have in 2017 and we'll carry that profile of shipments all the way through 2020. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. I had two questions. One is if you can just address the impact of the IRS extension for both your pipeline and your customers and then any comments on either de-bookings or contract renegotiations that your customers had with you? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. So I guess on the ITC extension, we think it's probably a positive in the long run for the system business. I think in the longer-term it may delay some of the utility ownership of solar as you're going to see continued competitiveness of PPAs with ITC versus utility-owned generation and rate basing. And that's where you're going to have a delay of a transition which may actually delay what could be a longer, more optimal capital structure moving away from tax equity which is less efficient and more expensive rather to a more traditional infrastructure financing option. But I think in the short-term, yeah, we see it as a positive. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: As it relates to the customer and the contracts, nothing new there in terms of what we said before. There are allegations between both parties. There's security associated with it. There's termination penalties associated with it. I think we looked at it again. I think we're 90-plus-percent, 95%, maybe higher than that of our contracted pipeline of module sales which I think is around 8 gigawatts. All has security associated with it. Again, I think spirit of which we negotiated these contracts with our customers was again somewhat risk sharing and an understanding of fair economics that would enable their projects to be successful. And that's the way we're moving forward. And our customers are honoring those obligations as well. Operator : And our final question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks so much for sneaking me in. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in the development business, particularly as it relates to integration of energy storage and what you're seeing in terms of pricing from your competitors and how difficult it is to close projects at this point? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So development is obviously \u2013 it can be \u2013 it depends on where you are. It depends on how the RFP is structured. It depends on what bid bonds have to be posted in order to bid, what dollars are at risk, the tenor of the PPA of 15 years versus 20 or 25. I mean, every opportunity on the development side can differ relative to its attractiveness and relative to its competitiveness, relative to how aggressive things can be. And we've got to be very selective in that regard because you can't get into certain opportunities where you got developers, especially if it's a free option, and you got developers that are just going to make crazy assumptions around the installed cost or they are going to assume some huge hockey-stick on a merchant curve. And a merchant curve may have an assumption of a carbon tax embedded in or may have an assumption of storage already incorporated even though the asset doesn't have the capability to create firm power. I mean there's some \u2013 all kinds of dimensions and flavors that can happen that are out there that can really drive some really aggressive assumptions. What a developer is only worried about is capturing that PPA and flipping it to somebody else and then let them worry about it over the long run. They'd make their money and they move on, right. So it can be very competitive and we've got to be very selective with where we play and how we play and site selection and interconnection positions can be critical at times. And then so we have done selection. That's also why I said in my comments that I don't want a very high win rate on development. If we're winning a very high percentage of development we will probably have taken on a lot of risk and we don't want to do that, right. As it relates to storage, again, given what's going on and where you hear, like, similar to the deal that we did with APS, other deals that are happening with Xcel in Colorado and some of the views of PV plus storage and the capability of time shift and creating firm power it's becoming more and more mainstream and most of the utility RFPs that we are doing. Whether it's PPA or whether it's rate base or whatever else it may be, it's becoming more and more power in place and we would expect that to happen. And that's a good thing because now it just further expands the market opportunity for storage. Now we still believe that there can be an interim stuff that with creating flexible storage, using design reserves, capabilities that we have, that you can actually have a much higher penetration of PV before you get into serious issues and need for storage. But we're giving utilities a choice. We can demonstrate flexibility and we've done a work recently with a consultant with one of the large utilities. And we've demonstrated to them the full capabilities of flexible PV and how it can honestly drive down operating cost. And I think that was an insightful study that was done. We're hopeful we can actually make that a public announcement here near-term. And I think other utilities will open up their perspectives around PV. And whether they go straight to storage or go more to a flexible storage platform with design reserves, the options will be there. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Co., Inc. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Operator : Please standby. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investors.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2018. Following their remarks, we'll then have time for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Our financial results for the third quarter were solid with net sales of $676 million and earnings of $0.54 per share, driven by the sale of development projects. From an operations standpoint, we have started the first commercial shipments of Series 6 from our factory in Vietnam and progress to date on the initial ramp has been good. Commercially, we continue to be very pleased with the strong demand for our technology as demonstrated by our net bookings of 1.1 gigawatts since our prior call. It is important to note, we have booked over 1.6 gigawatts since the May 31 solar policy change in China. Before delving into the specifics of the most recent bookings, I think it's important to highlight some of the trends that we are seeing and which support the near-term and long-term growth of utility-scale solar globally. As has been the case for some time, the low cost of solar power continues to be the primary driver of demand. Beginning with U.S., solar procurement from utilities and corporate customer is strong and growing. According to a leading third party market research firm, 8.5 gigawatts of utility-scale solar was procured in the first six months of 2018 alone. Looking forward, we expect this procurement trend will continue to be robust. Based on our tracking of utility integrated resource plans as well as other public announcements, we expect utilities outside of California to procure more than 15 gigawatts of solar in the coming three years, a number that has increased by several gigawatts over the past year. Much of the growth is coming from regions such as the Midwest and the mid-Atlantic which are still in the early stage of utility-scale solar adoption. Several announcements over the course of this year highlight the trends of U.S. utility-scale solar growth. For example, AEP announced the plan to add more than 3 gigawatts of solar as a target of 60% reduction in CO2 emissions. Similarly, in its 2018 integrated resource plan, consumer energy in Michigan proposed a 5 gigawatts of solar and the plans to retire all coal generation by 2040. Most recently, NIPSCO, the second large utility in Indiana decided to retire all of its remaining coal power plants in some cases as much as 15 years earlier than previously expected and replace them with over 1-gigawatt of solar. NIPSCO cited the low cost of renewable energy as a key factor in this decision. Notably, all three of these utilities are in regions that have not historically been associated with solar but where the low cost of solar power now provides a compelling economic alternative to thermal generation. When you factor in additional procurement in California, which has passed the mandate for more than 60% of renewable power by 2030 and has decided to close its last nuclear power plant by 2025. The potential for solar growth in the U.S. over the next several years is even greater. It's important to note that nuclear power plant closure was not made solely on the basis of solar's favorable economics. The limited flexibility of the nuclear plant to adjust to market price signals relative to solar was another key factor in the decision. Within the renewable sector itself, another factor supporting the growth of utility-scale solar in the U.S. is its increasing competitiveness relative to wind. As the production tax credit continues to step down and with the recent IRS guidance establishing ITC Safe Harbor requirements, it's expected that solar deployments will outpace wind in the U.S. through 2023. The transition is expected to be particularly noticeable among corporate buyers of renewable energy who in recent years have tended to procure more wind than solar. With multiple gigawatts in our development portfolio, we expect to be able to take advantage of the recent IRS Commence Construction Guidelines and enhance the value of these development opportunities. Outside of the U.S., economics also continue to drive solar growth in many markets. For example in India, the LCOE of solar power is around $20 a megawatt hour less than coal. Similar economic benefits as well as growing concerns about carbon emissions have led to a resurgence in solar demand across many parts of Europe. Last year, Spain awarded 4 gigawatts through a tender process and many more gigawatts are being planned in Europe, in some cases, on a merchant basis, as a result of the low cost of solar energy. In France, EDF recently announced its solar power plant with intentions to develop and build 30 gigawatts of solar from 2020 to 2035. And another factor that may have a significant impact on solar procurement in coming years is the potential for increased electrification of transportation. While it is uncertain how quickly the transition to EVs will occur, momentum is building and there is a potential for significant solar deployments driven by this shift. With this context around what we're seeing in the macro environment, I'll now turn to slide 4 to discuss new bookings since our last earnings call. In total, our net bookings since the prior earnings call were 1.1 gigawatts, which brings our total year-to-date net bookings to 5.2 gigawatts. Continuing the trend in the first half of the year, systems bookings were especially strong this quarter with more than 350 megawatts of new development projects. After accounting for shipments of approximately 700 megawatts during the third quarter, our future expected shipments, which stretch into 2021, are now 11.3 gigawatts. We are largely sold out to the end of 2020 when taking into account our new bookings in combination with opportunities that are signed, but not yet counted as bookings. Our systems bookings are comprised of two PPAs that we signed with leading utilities in the U.S. The first of these projects was a 50-megawatt AC project that we will construct for PacifiCorp in order to provide affordable solar power to a Facebook data center in Oregon. We are excited about the opportunity to partner with PacifiCorp and contribute to powering Facebook's operations with 100% renewable energy. The project is expected to achieve COD in 2020. The second PPA for the quarter was a 227 megawatt AC agreement signed with a major utility in the southeastern United States. This project is intended to support a collaboration between the utility and its corporate buyer to meet renewable energy objectives. It's a tremendous opportunity to be part of this project, which is expected to reach COD in 2021. Additional details will be available in the future. Both of these projects are prime examples of our differentiated capabilities that enable us to address the renewable energy goals of corporate buyers in partnership with utilities by leveraging efficient and reliable large scale offsite generation. Since our first C&I PPA with Apple, we have now contracted nearly 1 gigawatt DC with corporate buyers to support their renewable energy goals. With the increasing number of companies joining the RE100, we expect C&I demand will continue to grow and we believe that we are strongly positioned to serve the needs of this segment. In addition to these project development bookings, we also signed a 50 \u2013 excuse me \u2013 we also signed an EPC agreement with Tampa Electric to construct a 50 megawatt AC project in Florida. This marks the fifth EPC agreement that we have signed with Tampa Electric, and we continue to look for ways that we can partner together. Note: this is not included in an incremental booking as we have signed the module agreement for this project last year. The remainder of our bookings for module sales in the U.S. and various international markets, new international bookings of nearly 300 megawatts are particularly notable in light of the challenging price environment in certain markets. In contracting this volume, we remain disciplined with regard to pricing and continue to focus on our points of differentiation. This differentiation includes focusing on regions where our technology has energy advantage, deep customer relationships, and opportunities that favor our leading eco-efficient technology. As we move forward, we will continue to leverage these strengths to capture the best opportunities across all of our markets. Lastly, before moving on to other topics, I'll briefly highlight the progress we are making in our O&M business. Year-to-date, we have booked 2.3 gigawatts of new projects, bringing the total fleet under contract to nearly 11 gigawatts. With nearly 80% of this year's bookings coming from projects where we are not the developer, we continue to capture additional value with our O&M offerings. The single largest booking this year is a 530-megawatt agreement with Tampa Electric to provide O&M services across several project sites. We began initially with Tampa Electric as a module agreement arrangement has grown into the scope to include EPC services and, now, O&M services. We strive to be a solar partner of choice for utilities and this is another example of how we can leverage our capabilities to meet our customers' needs. Continuing on to slide 5, I'll next discuss our mid- to late-stage bookings, opportunities, which now total 7.9 gigawatts DC, a decrease of approximately 400 megawatts from Q2 due to the strong bookings reported today. On a geographical basis, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 6.7 gigawatts DC. However, we also continue to have a significant number of opportunities in both Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Similar to prior quarters, the total potential opportunities includes deals that are signed, but not yet counted as bookings until certain conditions precedent are closed. The total is now more than 550 megawatts, a slight decrease from the prior quarter due to the projects that were booked. Included in this total is a 150-megawatt DC PPA opportunity in the Western U.S. In addition today, which is not reflected on the slide, we signed another PPA that is over 140 megawatts DC in size, which when included, brings this total to approximately 700 megawatts. Our Q3 systems bookings of approximately 450 megawatts DC, we now have 2.5 gigawatts DC of future contracted systems shipments. Combined with the 2.6 gigawatts of mid-to-late stage opportunities, which now includes 300 megawatts DC of projects that are signed, but subject to CPs, we feel we have good line of sight to our 1-gigawatt yearly systems goal. Continuing on to slide 6, I'll next provide an update on our Series 6 production ramp. The most significant development to highlight from the past quarter was the start of our production at our first Vietnam factory in September. With this milestone, we now have three facilities in three separate locations producing Series 6 modules. Commercial shipments began from this location earlier this month. And the factory is demonstrating throughput levels at 35% of full capability in only two months since the start of production. The factory ramp was accelerated relative to Ohio and Malaysia by applying prior learnings, including starting production with an improved model framing tool. With each successive factory ramp, we expect the length of time needed to reach full production levels will be progressively shorter as we implement best known methods captured from the prior factory ramps. Our second factory in Vietnam is also making good progress towards the start of production. Construction on the facility is now complete and more than 80% of the tools have been delivered. We originally anticipated that the factory would start production in the second quarter of 2019, but based on the tremendous effort of our manufacturing and engineering teams, we now expect production will commence in the middle of Q1 2019. Finally, construction of our second U.S. factory in Ohio remains on track. Relative to our Ohio and Malaysia Series 6 factories, since our last earnings call, we have made good progress ramping each of these plants. Our Ohio factory is now demonstrating throughput levels near 90% of its full capability as compared to 60% at the time of our last call. Our Malaysian factory is demonstrating throughput levels at 75% of full throughput capability versus 40% previously. In Ohio, we are finishing the installation of the last inventory accumulator to adequately buffer the line. In Malaysia, we are just starting the installation of the accumulators and expect completion by year end. We also continue to make good progress upgrading the toolset, primarily focused on improving availability for both factories. For example in Ohio, we have completed approximately 70% of the tool upgrades identified. The combination of the accumulators and toolset upgrades are expected to enable both of these factories to demonstrate full throughput capabilities by the end of the year. Module wattage in our lead factory in Ohio continues to improve steadily with approximately 50% of recent production at 420 watts per module or higher when running at full process entitlement. This compares to wattage of around 415 watts at the time of our future earnings call. We are now seeing top bin reaching 430 watts per module versus 425 watts as of the last call. Module wattage for our Malaysian and Vietnam factories is lower than Ohio as we are still in the process of matching the efficiency between the factories. Note, during the initial factory ramp, we do not run our anti-reflective coating products. We ramp our non-ARC product first to focus on throughput and performance. A key driver of matching efficiency to our lead factory will be the transition of our anti-reflective coated product. In addition, because these factories are still in the early ramp phases, bin distributions are much wider than our lead factory. Over time and as we match the process between the factories, we expect the fleet average efficiency to increase and bin distribution to narrow. Lastly, before I hand the call up to Alex, I'd like to briefly highlight some of the remarkable work that First Solar as a thought leader in the industry is helping to facilitate related to grid flexible solar. At our Analyst Day last December, we introduced the concept of Solar 2.0 which moves beyond the traditional view of solar as an energy-only contract to valuing solar as a flexible and dispatchable resource. As we highlighted at the time, flexible solar can enable solar penetration rates without the need to add storage. As part of our comprehensive engagement with stakeholders on this topic, we recently sponsored a study conducted by E3, which simulated the impact of flexible solar on an actual forward utility system. The results of the study are impressive and indicate that operating in solar flexibly as a scheduled resource provides significant additional value to the utility, any form of expected reduced fuel and maintenance cost for conventional generation reduced curtailment of solar output and reduced air emissions. The study simulated the utility-scale solar deployment at a level up to 28% annual solar energy penetration and the benefits increased as the level of solar penetration grew. While we discuss more about this topic on future calls, we invite you to view our recent press release on the topic and visit the E3 website to access the study. I'll now turn the call over to Alex who will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2018. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Before turning to our financial results for the quarter, I'd like to highlight that we'll be hosting a call in late Q4 to discuss our outlook and financial guidance for 2019. A press release with the date and detail of the event will be issued approximately two weeks in advance of the call. As Mark mentioned, we had solid third quarter financial results driven by the sale of several development projects. I'll provide some more context beginning on slide 8. Third quarter net sales of $676 million, an increase of $367 million compared to the previous quarter. The higher net sales were primarily a result of closing the sale of the Willow Springs project in the U.S., the Manildra project in Australia, and selling some smaller Japan assets. Note that each of these projects achieved initial revenue recognition in Q3 based on the respective project percentage of completion. In addition, we recognized high revenue from the California Flats Project as compared to the prior quarter. Systems revenue as a percentage of total quarterly net sales increased to 82% in Q3 versus 66% in Q2 as a result of the project sales mentioned. Third quarter gross margin grew to 19% as compared to a negative 3% in the prior quarter. The improvement was due to the mix of higher gross profit projects recognized and a $25 million reduction to our module collection recycling or EOL liability, partially offset by higher third quarter Series 6 ramp charges of $48 million. Our systems segment margin was 24% in the third quarter and the modules segment margin was a negative 5%. As it relates to the modules segment gross margin, bear in mind that sales were still comprised entirely of Series 4 volume as early Series 6 volume was allocated entirely to our systems business. However, the modules segment COGS is comprised of both Series 4 COGS and Series 6 ramp-related costs. And these are allocated in the modules segment. The net reduction to the modules segment gross margin from ramp-related costs partially offset by the EOL adjustment was $23 million. Third quarter operating expenses were $71 million, a decrease of $25 million compared to Q2. Plant start-up expenses decreased by $10 million as a result of lower Series 6 pre-production activities in Malaysia, partially offset by increases for initial Vietnam factory. In part, the lower start-up was due to accumulated learnings from the prior two Series 6 factory start-ups which we've been able to apply to Vietnam. SG&A was lower versus the prior quarter primarily due to a benefit from the reduction to our module collection and recycling liability, and lower variable compensation. Q3 operating income was $59 million compared to an operating loss of $104 million in the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in operating income was primarily due to higher net sales, improved gross margin, and lower operating expenses. Income tax expense of $2 million in Q3 as compared to a tax benefit of $6 million in Q2. To relate, the U.S. tax reform enacted last December, we have not recorded any adjustment through Q3 related to our original estimates. We expect to finalize our accounting related to tax reform in Q4 based upon finalization of currently proposed tax regulations and the filing of our federal and state income tax returns. The combination of the abovementioned items resulted in earnings of $0.54 per share in Q3 compared to a net loss in the second quarter of $0.46 per share. Moving to slide 9, I'll next discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, a decrease of $405 million from the prior quarter, primarily as a result of capital expenditures for the ongoing Series 6 capacity expansion and the timing of receipts from system projects. Third quarter net working capital which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $215 million. The change is primarily due to an increase in unbilled accounts receivable. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $466 million, an increase of $10 million from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily associated in current project level debt in Japan and Australia, partially offset by debt assumed by the purchase of the Manildra project. As a reminder, essentially all of our outstanding debt is project-related, and will come off our balance sheet when the projects are sold. Cash used in operations was $225 million, primarily due to the timing of receipts from systems projects. Keep in mind that when we sell an asset with project level debt that is assumed by the buyer, the operating cash flow associated with the sale is less than if the buyer had not assumed the debt. In Q3, buyers of our projects assumed $56 million of liabilities related to these transactions, and year-to-date, that total is $116 million. Capital expenditures were $238 million in the third quarter, compared to a $195 million in the prior quarter. The cumulative spend on Series 6 capacity now exceeds $1 billion, out of total expected spend of around $1.9 billion, so 6.6 gigawatts of capacity. And lastly, depreciation and amortization expense was $34 million in Q3 versus $30 million in the last quarter. Turning to slide 10, I'll next give you our updated 2018 guidance. Before covering the detailed updates to our guidance range, there are some key business updates to discuss. Firstly, as we highlighted on last quarter's call, there was the potential for our guidance to be lowered based on the sales timing of our Ishikawa project in Japan. Despite the weather-related issue experienced earlier this year, all modules have been installed and construction of the project is nearing completion. However, based on the timing of the sale process, we now expect to complete the sale of the project in 2019. While this does impact our 2018 outlook, the sale in 2019 allows us to optimize transaction and realize the full expected value of the project rather than potentially sacrificing project value to ensure closing this year. The impact to delay in the sale of the Ishikawa project is expected to be partially offset by the sale of two other smaller Japan projects. Selling these projects in Q4 has been part of our opportunity portfolio and with the revised timing of the Ishikawa sale in 2019, it now makes sense to aim the complete sale process for these projects in 2018. Secondly, we expect a reduction on our module sales for the year, as a result of some changes in shipment timing, as well as a reduction in certain international shipments. And thirdly, as we progress through the year, we determined that while the cost for our initial start-up activities for Series 6 is lower than originally expected, the savings is expected to be more than offset by higher ramp costs. As a result of this distribution of Series 6-related expense, we expect cost of sales to be higher due to the increase in ramp costs while operating expenses will be lower due to reduced start-up. So, with these in mind, we're revising our 2018 outlook as follows. Starting with net sales, we're lowering the range to a revised forecast of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion in order to reflect lower module sales and the revised timing of the Ishikawa project sale which is expected to be partially offset by other Japan projects mentioned. Our expected gross margin has been lowered by approximately 200 basis points to a revised range of 18.5% and 19.5%. The reduction accounts for the increase in ramp and related costs from $60 million to $100 million, lower margin from module sales, and the change in mix of systems projects to be sold. The operating expense forecast has been lowered by $45 million to a revised range of $345 million to $355 million. Plant start-up expenses decreasing by $30 million to $90 million for the full year. The remaining reduction in OpEx is primarily due to capital management of core operating expenses. Our outlook for operating income has been revised down by $40 million as a midpoint to a new range of $90 million to $110 million, as a result of the low revenue and gross margin partially offset by the reduction of operating expenses. Below operating income, the most significant update is the forecast of full-year tax expense, which is now expected to be approximately $15 million. The decrease from our prior expectation of approximately $35 million is a result of reduced operating income as well as the change in the jurisdictional mix of income. Our guidance continues to assume minimal additional equity in earnings to the balance of the year. And putting these revisions together, our earnings per share guidance is now $1.40 to $1.60. The operating cash flow range has been lowered by $200 million as a result of the revised timing of project accounts receivable collections and lower module sales. With some projects receiving Series 6 modules later than initially planned, this is concentrated work later in the year and resulted in some cash collection timing moving from 2018 into early 2019. Capital expenses are unchanged at $800 million to $900 million for the full year. As a result of the decrease in operating cash flow, we're lowering our net cash guidance by $200 million to a range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. And lastly, we're lowering our shipment guidance for the year by 200 megawatts to a revised range of 2.6 to 2.7 gigawatts. And that change is due to the lower module sales mentioned previously. Finally, turning to slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from our call today. Firstly, we had very good execution and solid financial results in the third quarter as we closed several projects sales and managed our OpEx effectively. As you've seen over the course of the year, the timing of project sales can produce uneven quarterly results. As we move forward, this trend is likely to continue, particularly as it relates to international project sales to may be sold near its completion of construction. Secondly, as we continue to make progress with our Series 6 manufacturing round, we now have a third factory shipping Series 6 modules and demonstrated throughput continues to improve across all sites. We've also accelerated start-up production of our fourth Series 6 factory. And lastly, the strength of demand for our Series 6 product remains the highlight. With bookings of 1.1 gigawatts since our previous call and total future contracts of shipments of 11.3 gigawatts, we have strong visibility to future demand. In particular, with over 350 megawatts of PPA award included in our new bookings, more than 1.6 gigawatts of systems bookings year-to-date, we continue to make excellent progress in building a systems portfolio that we expect to average approximately 1 gigawatt per year over the next few years. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question today will come from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Since the end of May, module pricing continues to fall lower. We're getting to very low levels now. And I know your cost structure can compete with it. But I wanted to ask a few questions around this topic. So is the current environment putting any economic pressure at all on your 2019 or 2020 bookings for either Series 6 or Series 4? I know your contracts were legally binding, but what kind of pressure, if any, are you receiving from your customers? We hear the pressure may only be on Series 4 which is a much smaller percentage of your overall bookings. Additionally, how much of your current bookings are for Series 4 and how much Series 4 capacity is left to book? And then finally, would you contemplate winding down Series 4 capacity earlier than expected? I recall back in December, you guys extended that capacity, but would you consider ramping that down earlier than expected and then in turn accelerating the Series 6 expansion there? Thanks. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: All right. Philip, there's quite a few of them. So hopefully I'll get them all. Let's start with the economics on the 1.1 gigawatts which 700 or so megawatts was module and the 350 megawatts or so that we highlighted was our systems business. So, when you look at the module business \u2013 and again, of that 700 megawatts, about 300 megawatts of it was outside of the U.S. Slightly more than half of that volume was actually Series 4 of that 700 megawatts. So, there was a big chunk of Series 4 in there. And then most of the international number that we cited was international and that was a Series 6. I am \u2013 again, we tried to highlight in the script, in the prepared remarks that we have a very good luxury of focusing on where we can capture the highest value, where we can capture \u2013 where have point of differentiation, where we can capture the energy yield that we have in certain markets, where we can capture the eco-efficient or eco-friendly attributes of our module and focus on those markets. And so, when I \u2013 when you look at that and you look at the economics and what we saw for both Series 4 new bookings and Series 6 new bookings, and you've got to remember the Series 6, in particular bookings are starting to go up further into because we're sold out through 2020. So, we're starting to see more latter half of 2020 kind of buying books that we saw this quarter. We saw a nominal reduction to the ASPs in this quarter. Our sales teams have done a fabulous job of positioning the product, capturing the best value from the customer. And I'm talking nominal being 10% deltas on ASPs, right. From what we booked last quarter versus what we booked this quarter on both Series 4 and Series 6. So I'm extremely happy with that. The team has done a great job of getting the best value for that product. And the way I would look at that is where we're pricing Series 4 with the new bookings will be kind of mid-teens type of margin which I'm happy with. And then I'm getting about \u2013 and if I look at my last quarter bookings I got about a 10% premium of Series 6 over my Series 4 price. So that's obviously very, very positive. So from that standpoint the volume is great and the actual underlying ASPs and the economics relative to the headlines. I understand what's going on in the market now here as well sometimes from our customers. I understand pricing in some markets is very aggressive. We're not seeing anything today. And if we do, we're not going to book it because I don't need to, right? So we're booking good economics with good customers and we have great relationships with. So that's kind of a new bookings aspect. As it relates to the contracts, as I said before, the contracts were negotiated with customers with a risk sharing approach and creating binding obligations between both parties to perform. And to the extent if the parties do not perform, then there's implications around that to that party, right? We have LDs. If we don't deliver, per requirements, our customers will have a cost associated with termination and forfeiture of deposits and those types of things, right? As it relates to Series 6, I haven't had one customer come to me in the United States, and have any discussion relative to that. So we haven't seen that. And the customer understands if they want to do that, then it's very clear what the implications are and won't force our rights underneath the contract. We had a couple of examples internationally that we, for example, in a couple of markets that have turned soft. We had one example with a customer that we were selling modules into China. And given what's happening with the policy changes in China, they didn't move forward with the contract and we took their 20% security. Right? So, again, we will enforce the rights underneath our contracts. We had \u2013 there was a small number of megawatts that we had in India because of what's happened with the new tariffs. I'm talking small megawatts \u2013 it was less than 10 megawatts \u2013 that we shipped the vast majority of the contract, and there was a small residual amount that didn't ship based off of the timing of the cutoffs of when the tariffs would be applied. So, we didn't fulfill that contract, the 10 megawatts to that customer. And we've had a little bit of noise because of what's happened with economic turmoil in Turkey, but that customer is going to redeploy those modules to opportunities outside of Turkey. But that's the backdrop of what we've seen relative to our contracts. As it relates to Series 4 with the current bookings that we just had, we're sold out of Series 4. So, we've got more than enough demand around Series 4. So, there's no more Series 4 volume that we need to worry about contracting. Now, we will \u2013 I said this before. As it relates to some of our contracts, we have optionality of delivering Series 4 versus Series 6 for some of our customers. We need to focus on what creates the best position of strength for First Solar in 2021, and a higher mix of Series 6 is going to be better for me. Scale is important; drives contribution margin. So, I want as much capacity of Series 6 in 2021. Now, it may mean that I may negotiate with some customers to move some volume that's contracted in Series 4 over into Series 6 in order to \u2013 and potentially push some of that volume into 2021 in order to enable me to scale and to capture the highest Series 6 production profile that I can in 2021. So, those discussions could be happening with customers and we'll continue to look at that. So, as it relates to our decision around that, we may provide a little bit more color on our guidance call in December, but some of those conversations are having \u2013 we are having with our customers in the background. Operator : Your next question comes from... Stephen Haymore - First Solar, Inc.: Would you please go to the next... Operator : ...Sophie Karp with Guggenheim Securities. Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering as far as systems demand in the U.S., are there any particular areas, states in particular, that you see that are stronger than others? I know some of your competitors have also been a highlight in Texas and some other Southeast States. So, I'm kind of curious where you see demand coming from in the next few years. Thank you. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I think \u2013 for us in particular, Southeast is a really strong market. As we highlight, one of the larger PPAs that we announced as part of our booking this quarter was with a utility in the Southeastern U.S. We \u2013 last quarter we also announced we had an acquisition of a portfolio of projects in the Southeast which also came with a PPA and we're real happy with having more development sites in the South Carolina region, in particular. We're doing a lot with TECO; you saw that. So, the Southeast region is a very strong region for us across Texas, and then obviously, into the Southwest continues to be a good market. But the one thing I would say, and we kind of highlighted this in the \u2013 especially as you look across the horizon, to your question, over the next couple years, solar is only going to be increasingly more and more competitive through 2023. And if you look at some analyst reports, especially when you go beyond 2019 into 2020, over the next several years, you're going to see the vast majority of utility-scale renewables being solar. And so, I had, actually \u2013 I'll use an analogy that one of my customers used who does both solar and wind. Their view over that horizon is if you look at the map of the U.S. today and red being solar and blue being wind, there'll be a convergence of red all over the blue. So the red will continue to grow mainly \u2013 around most of the U.S., except for maybe the Midwestern states where there's very strong \u2013 Central states where there's a very strong wind resource. So as you look at it over the next several years, you're going to start seeing competitiveness of solar across many different geographies. I was talking with a customer recently, even in the Northeast where wind is a good resource, the economics are penciling out better for solar right now. So I think we're strong in a couple of traditional markets today, but that's only going to expand and grow; and, we highlight what we're seeing with AEP and what's going on in Michigan and Indiana. So across Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, those are all states that are in early innings and we're seeing tremendous amount of opportunity for solar deployments over the next several years. Operator : And our next question will come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question, Mark. It is a little bit difficult at the moment to get a handle on what the normalized gross margins are and what your earnings power through the cycle is here. It looks like the cycle itself is somewhat kind of attenuated by this visibility you have. So I'm hoping that you're getting to the point now where you're able to forecast the earnings power within the band for a couple of years, at least. Is that starting to come into focus? And when can we understand what your gross margin kind of structure is? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. Paul, certainly, internally we obviously forecast it out. I don't see us providing guidance out multiple years. We'll provide guidance to 2019, specifically, later this year. But if you go back to the Analyst Day that we had in December of last year, we gave an outlook at that point trying to break down the various components of the value chain that we have through the module development piece through EPC and through O&M. And we gave indicative gross margin numbers around that. And we said at the time that that was being used for guidance for the year, but you could think about that as an indicative view of how we looked at the business in the long term. You're right that the current visibility we have over the next few years, based on the contracted pipeline, is very helpful for us, and I think the message we gave in the Analyst Day still holds, which is those are good indicative ranges to use when you think about gross margin across the various segments. We've talked about the amount of the development business that we look to have around that gigawatt a year mix of self-developed project assets plus EPC business. So, you can use that. And then, internally, clearly as Mark said, we are focusing on putting ourselves in the strongest position we can for 2021, such that when we're through this period of current contracted backlog, hopefully fully over to Series 6, to our most advanced product at (40:42) that point, we still maintain a competitive position even in a market where we'll naturally see ASPs come down. And we're seeing that competitive environment be strong at the moment. So, for the long term view, I would still guide you back to what we talked about last year and, obviously, there's considerable strength over the next couple of years based on the contracted pipeline we have today. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing I would just add to that is that I do \u2013 we do try to hopefully get people to continue to think about not only at the gross margin level, but what is the op margin expansion that we can see as we see higher contribution margin coming through from growth, right, as we continue to expand the platform. One of the challenges we have right now is we're only producing a little bit less than 3 gigawatts when you combine the Series 4 and the Series 6. And the Series 4 is two-thirds of that number, and that's obviously not our most advantaged product. So just as that mix shifts from all the Series 6, and then we start growing from 3 gigawatts and to 4 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts and 6 gigawatts and to 7 gigawatts with a relatively flat OpEx profile, there's an opportunity for a meaningful op margin expansion which I think everyone needs to take into consideration. Operator : The next question will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two of them. I guess first off, last quarter if I recall correctly, you called out lower margins due to some higher ramp cost on the back end of Series 6. So wondering what's incremental here in 3Q since it sounds like you're calling that out again as one reason for the outlook change here? And then I had a follow-up. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I think on the other ramp, I think, actually the last quarter we were at $60 million for the full year and that was a number for the prior quarter. I think we started the year right around $60 million or so of ramp. So we hadn't changed the ramp last quarter, so and the guidance didn't reflect any change to the ramp. What happened this quarter, partly because we ended up starting our Vietnam factory, first Vietnam factory, and we'll start our second Vietnam factory sooner than we had anticipated, is that the profile has shifted from start-up into ramp. So start-ups come down $30 million. The full-year number now for ramp is $100 million. So it went from $60 million to $100 million. So there's about a $40 million increase in ramp. $30 million of that is just the kind of geography shift between start-up and the ramp. There is about a $10 million of incremental ramp cost. Some of that is partly \u2013 we're still working in both Malaysia and Ohio. Our framing cell is still \u2013 it's basically manual back-end process. And the throughput through there is still not where we want it to be. And as well, we also had to hire some incremental labor in order to deal with the revisions that we made to the frames. So, there's some of that costs that \u2013 that's in there. But the way I would look at it, Brian, outlook to outlook, ramp, what we guided to last call, the $60 million that was consistent with Q2 \u2013 excuse me, Q1 and now it's going from $60 million to $100 million, but $30 million of it was geography shift and $10 million of it relates to some incremental ramp that we are seeing mainly associated with Malaysia and Ohio. Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. No, that's helpful color. Appreciate that. And then just my second question was around free cash flow. I know there's a bunch of moving pieces here but the \u2013 the end result this quarter was pretty negative. And then if I look back a little bit further at the overall cash flow profile since your Analyst Day in December, there's been like a $350 million to $400 million swing in free cash flow to the negative as cash flow from ops is down and CapEx is up. So, wondering how you're thinking about the profile into 2019 and if you're confident that free cash flow can get back to positive next year or if that's maybe still too aggressive of you right now to assume just given the recent trajectory. Thank you. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. Brian, I'm not going to comment on 2019 but I'll \u2013 we'll give you numbers later in the year. I think when it comes to the off-cash fees, there's a lot of noise based on how we've been selling assets. So, I wouldn't focus particularly on that. But what you're seeing a lot on the free cash and on the cash position overall is a significant decrease at the moment, just based on timing. So, as we've been shipping Series 6 product later to certain sites, that means one of the EPC agreements we'll get milestones later. And when they're in the billing cycle, we're receiving cash later. So, we've got a dip in the quarter here which may actually go through the end of the year as well just based on the timing of construction. So, we're actually seeing receipts from the some of the larger projects we have potentially spilling out over the end of the year in 2019. And you're going to see a reflection of that in terms of the unbilled amounts on the balance sheet as well. We've also added in Perrysburg too. So, if you go back to beginning of the year on the CapEx side with an initial guidance we have in December that CapEx is going to have significantly booked with adding in the new Perrysburg plant as well. And then lastly, we've also structured a couple of deals recently where we have pretty back-end loaded cash flow profiles. If you look at the cost of carry from a project perspective, relative to the opportunity cost and the cash in the balance sheet at the moment, we've been using some of that cash optimizing some of the project returns and timing of cash flow receipts from projects. So you're seeing a lot on the project side that's causing noise for the year. And then later in the year, we'll give you an update on 2019. Operator : And our next question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. (46:31), so, just on Series 6, so I'm clear, because you have \u2013 I heard you say, Mark, the pull forward, our Vietnam starting up faster, so you have some extra cost there. And then you have the framing cost. And so, I just want to sure that we leave this call understanding where you are in the technology level, and at the same time, the cost level, so we can model that out. So, are you there... Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yes. Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: ... with the technology? And this is a onetime thing, and then the cost is where you would expect it to be? And then, we've pulled forward some Vietnam because you guys did better than you expected? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. So, let's talk about \u2013 part of the question was around the ramp delta, right, from what we had last quarter to this quarter. So, the vast majority of the ramp delta, $40 million, $30 million of that was just a geography move from startup into ramp, because we were successful at pulling forward Vietnam into production faster. And we're actually going to pull forward Vietnam, too, sooner \u2013 faster as well. We highlighted to that as well. So, that's just a geography shift in terms of where the cost goes. $10 million was the incremental ramp cost, for the reasons that I said, mainly for \u2013 associated with Malaysia and Ohio, mainly on the back end for the framing cell and some of the manual processes that we had to put in place there. So \u2013 and then that is all being normalized away. So, as I indicated as well, in Perrysburg, we were at \u2013 we have one accumulator left to do, which will help sort of buffer the back end a little bit more, which will help drive higher throughput. But more importantly, we're 70% through on the tooling upgrade \u2013 tool set upgrades that we need to do. So, we have identified and prioritized a number of upgrades that we need to do for the tool set. We're 70% through on that. So, I'm happy with where we are there. As we indicated, Perrysburg, even with not having been fully buffered, but clearly the benefit of having buffered a significant portion of the line, we went from kind of a 60% capacity number to around a 90% capacity number. So, I'm really happy with that. Malaysia made similar progress. And as we progress through the balance of the year, we'll have accumulators installed at both factories. And as we indicated, we should be exiting the year where we need to be on both of those factories; so, feel good from that standpoint. As I said before, the tool set when we looked at it \u2013 when we communicated in the last call, two most critical things to me were really cycle time and performance of the tool set, and everything is still performing extremely well from that standpoint. So very confident that once we get \u2013 finish the buffering, get the availability where it needs to be, both of those factories should be running well. The other thing that we indicated was the \u2013 when we started at Vietnam, it already has an enhanced \u2013 has a different framing cell. And as a result of that, it's much more resilient in capability. And therefore, we're seeing better performance in Vietnam, and every new factory that we have going forward will have that revised framing cell and \u2013 plus other modifications that will be made. So that should help us ramp and get to full entitlement of our second Vietnam factory, and then obviously, Perrysburg after that. So \u2013 and we're starting to reach 430-watt modules. And so, I think when you look at it from that standpoint, we feel good. On the technology side, the one thing that I still \u2013 we need to tighten up the distribution. So we're seeing the top end starting to approach 430 watts, but we're still seeing tails in the bottom end that are not where we want to be. And part of that, as I alluded to in my prepared remarks, is that we will start \u2013 normally we'll start and we'll ramp through with our non-ARC product. And as a result of that, it's going to be a lower-efficiency product, for sure, because ARC is going to give you \u2013 if you had a 400-watt module or so, you're going to get 12 watts from the benefit of ARC. So that delta will drive to a lower bin. It's about two bins lower for a non-ARC product. Plus, it also drives higher costs. So the more non-ARC that they make does add about $0.01 to my cost profile. Now, when we get everything up and running and on \u2013 fully on ARC and we've got a new ARC application in a product that we're using that will \u2013 effectively we'll get to \u2013 almost 100% of our production will be on ARC. That $0.01 goes away. So near term, I got a $0.01 mix issue between ARC and non-ARC. And then, as we indicated in the last call, I've got \u2013 we are dealing with issues around tariffs that are impacting the cost of steel and the cost of the frames. So the frames, $0.01 or north of that of impact that we're dealing with on the module cost that's a headwind for us. So, we're dealing with a little bit of headwind there, and I'm dealing with a little bit of headwind just because my throughput is not where it needs to be. But as we drive the throughput up, we go from a non-ARC to an ARC product, and then we're still working through some solutions to try to get the cost out on the frame, get out from underneath the tariffs, source differently, other options that may happen that can drive that cost down, then we'll be able to get to where we need to be on that standpoint. So, I don't want you to leave the call with a view that we haven't \u2013 we still have some cost challenges. They're well understood in what we need to do, but we're going to have to deal with \u2013 and one that's probably structurally going to be the bigger challenge would be in the frame. Operator : The next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. First question here, just going back to the systems side of the business, obviously you've had continued success. Can I ask you \u2013 in terms of margins, obviously, we've seen pricing come down on the module side. How are you thinking about the margin profile persistence as you continue to scale this up and you see a little bit of a different geography? Is it still kind of in the same ballpark that you all have seen historically? Part one. And well, maybe the second question, I'll throw it out now. On the actual Series 6 panel, you kind of hit at it a little bit a second ago, but you kind of alluded to on the call the competitiveness of the panels themselves actually improving a little bit. Any sense of the magnitude, overall, versus what you'd been contemplating perhaps earlier this year, just as you think about it? Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: I'll let Alex take the system one. As it relates to the competitiveness of Series 6, we're very happy with how it's positioned in the market and the value that it's capturing. As I said, just on our bookings this last quarter, Series 6 versus Series 4, we've got a 10% premium of our Series 6 product over our Series 4 product, which when you couple a 10% premium with, I would say, a much lower cost profile entitlement, then that's a very attractive product. And the indications that we're getting from our customers \u2013 and I was recently at SPI, and one of our structure providers came over to me and was just very excited about Series 6 and the implications it has on helping them drive cost out as well on their structure, as well as the installation velocity and what we're hearing from our EPC partners. They're very happy with the ease of the installation, the ease of the wiring and the connections associated with it. So, we're seeing the same thing in our own projects that we're self-developing and executing on right now. So, what I'm seeing on Series 6 right now has been very much in line, maybe slightly more favorable than what we had anticipated, but the product's been very well received in the marketplace. Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. Julien, on the gross margin side, I refer you back again to the Analyst Day last year. I think at that point, we talked about our contracted pipeline having greater than 50% gross margin on the pure development piece. Now, the way we did that makes it clear as we broke out what we thought the entitlement for the module was, assuming a third party module sale, the total EPC, and then the residual development piece is a very small number. But on that development piece, we are seeing contacted margins greater than 50% on the existing pipeline, and new contracted development asset from the development piece, we are seeing over 20% gross margin. So, clearly, it's come down over time, but we're still seeing, I'd say, healthy gross margins on the development piece there. The other thing to say is that it depends a little bit who the buyer is and what the structure of the deal is. So if it's a contested auction in California for a busbar long-term PPA where there's a huge amount of competition. We may no longer be the best buyer because they're not going to sacrifice a successful gross margin profile for volume. But what we're seeing is there are a lot of opportunities out there for us to deploy the skills that we have and the team, and the opportunity set that we've built up over time in both sites and human capital. Through more complex PPAs, for instance, with C&I buyers, who have a different profile rather than contracting a significant amount of product and assuming that maybe some PPAs will fall away and just re-contracting them. Renewable energy buyers, corporate buyers have a much more reputation in focused procurement process where they're looking to make sure that everything they procure will actually go through, so the stronger counterparty risk piece that they place and that positions us very well for that. And then finally, also on the UOG side where again we can bring talent to bear and skills to bear that we have as a company that aren't necessarily the same across the board, and we can see successful margins there. And we don't look through where the procurement is happening, but in general, I'd say that especially with the backlog we have today of systems procured, we're not going to go out and chase margins down for the sake of volume when we're seeing enough opportunity, acceptable margins today to maintain today that gigawatt a year that we talked about. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. And the only thing I'll add is that \u2013 look, I think there is still quite a bit of demand for high quality assets. And so, when you look at the capital stack and across whether it's the tax equity side, I think it's becoming \u2013 where we thought that it maybe would be less competitive given some the tax reform that happened last year. We're not seeing that at all. We're seeing even more getting involved in the tax equity side here in the U.S. The cash equity, there's a lot of money being raised around the world that people are looking to deploy in either great quality assets from that standpoint. And we're even seeing on the debt side, aggressive pricing from that standpoint as well. So, all that accretes higher value to the projects and the value that we can capture. And we've got a very strong pipeline right now, not only here in the U.S., but Japan assets in Australia. I'm very happy with what we have, and we're going to continue to build upon that. I think the Safe Harboring opportunity that's in front of us. And again, an opportunity to deploy our balance sheet to carry multiple gigawatts of opportunities out in 2023 is going to be a very good position for us to be in. Operator : Our final question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. With capacity expansion and CapEx already locked in and product development pipeline now pretty much above the 1-gigawatt-per-year target, can we expect \u2013 this is use of cash question. Can we expect M&A or maybe capital return next year? And then regarding M&A specifically, do you see any opportunities for project pipelines or are there any technologies or new verticals of interest out there that you might be looking at? Alexander R. Bradley - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. Look, we continue to see most things that are happening in this space. We're always very happy to look at development portfolios. And I think Mark mentioned earlier we acquired a small development portfolio on the southeast this year. We're always happy to look at both early stage and contracted assets. So we'll continue to do that. In terms of technology, given that we have a unique and different technology relative to most players in the market, it's hard to see what could be out there that would be untouched to us. But there are things that we'll look at. And for instance we did make an acquisition last year that's helped develop our anti-reflective coating technology and it's been advantageous there. So we'll continue to look at things around the core technology. The other thing that comes up often is storage. As of today, we haven't seen anything that we think is differentiated enough to make it worth a lot investing in the source technology. We clearly will make sure we invest in understanding how to integrate storage and how to contract storage in a plant. But today I don't necessarily see us investing in the core storage technology. On the second piece there on capital return, we'll continue to look through the future opportunities and uses of cash. And we've talked before about having a waterfall and how we look at that funding our core operations, the capacity expansions, any M&A in developing business, and then having a reserve given the cyclicality of the industry that we're in. So, we'll look a bit more through that. The other piece I'd say is towards the end of this year. We're going to be talking a little bit more about the opportunity to Safe Harbor because we look out to the end of 2019 there could be considerable opportunity for us to Safe Harbor either through our module business or through using some of the balance sheet and that could give us a strategic advantage not available to other players without the financial resources we have. So, we want to always make sure that we're looking to use that cash as advantageously as possible. But if we go through that full waterfall, we can't see an opportunity to expand the business. And we have laid out a CapEx profile against the current capacity profile. If the future of solar is as we believe, there's no reason that that is a stopping point for us from a capacity perspective. So, that's something we're going to continue to monitor and look at when would be the right time to consider additional capacity, which obviously we prefer to do versus returning capital. But if we get to a point where we can't feel we could use that cash accretively at acceptable returns through the profile, then we'll, at that point, look at options to return capital. Mark R. Widmar - First Solar, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I'll add to in terms of the kind of use in entirety is that one of the things now that as we move forward with Series 6 and where we are, and obviously, there's a number of programs still on our efficiency roadmap, we're going to obviously look at our California team which is our advanced research team just to continue to think about the next evolution. Where is the next evolution with our current technology? Where can we take its fullest potential to go above and beyond? Now, as we do that, there may be opportunities that \u2013 opportunities may come up that some form of an acquisition or capability or \u2013 that we don't have today. If you guys remember one of the things that helped us with our core technology to where we got it today was the acquisition of the IP from GE a number of years ago. Alex referenced the acquisition of a new anti-reflective coating that's obviously beneficial to our product, not only from the standpoint of giving a better benefit to \u2013 a better efficiency benefit to the product, but also enabling us to capture almost 100% of the market with that product. And so, I would imagine as we think forward, especially with the creativity and capability of our advanced research team in California, there'll probably be some other opportunities as we think about, again, how do we evolve this technology to its fullest capability. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today and today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Haymore from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Haymore, you may begin. Stephen Haymore : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the Company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update; Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year and provide the latest updates around 2019 guidance. Following their remarks, we'll then have time for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by briefly discussing our EPS results for 2018. EPS of $1.36 came in slightly below the low-end of the guidance range we provided at the time of our Q3 earnings call.  While Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview, I wanted to highlight two items that had a material impact on the quarter. Firstly, late in the year we incurred increased EPC costs in order to meet deadlines for certain U.S. projects. Inclement weather and the late shipments of materials to sites adversely impacted plant construction and project commissioning schedule. The potential of project completion delay was particularly acute at one of our projects in California. To ensure the project capital structure proceeded as plan, we incurred significant acceleration cost to meet key schedule milestones.  While the project owner shared in a portion of these costs, acceleration cost impacted Q4 results by more than $10 million. Maintaining the strong relationship was a key priority and therefore we made an investment in our partnership and long-term relationship with this customer.  Secondly, in Q4, we continue to make good progress with our Series 6 factory construction start-up and ramp. As a result, we started production at our second Vietnam factory in the first week of this year three months ahead of our original plan and 45 days ahead of our latest expectation. The continued factory ramp across all sites combined with the earlier-than planned start-up of our second Vietnam factory put pressure on our supply chain to support the accelerated schedule.  To maintain continuous operations across the entire fleet, we decided to airfreight certain raw materials to our factory, which adversely impacted the fourth quarter by more than $10 million. Accelerating the Vietnam start date helps to provide resiliency to our 2019 Series 6 production plan. The production could lead to additional revenue, but more importantly, it creates optionality for downtime investment to increase throughput via tool upgrades or production buffers or to run engineering test articles to increase module efficiency. Turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll provide additional comments on 2018. Despite the year where the solar market faced excess capacity and pressure on module pricing, primarily as a result of policy changes in China we are able to make steady progress and strengthen First Solar\u2019s competitive position. In 2018, we added to our contracted pipeline with strong net bookings of 5.6 gigawatts DC, a greater-than 2 to 1 book-to-ship ratio which provides improved future visibility as we grow our Series 6 production over the coming years.  Systems projects were a significant portion of these bookings and we signed 1.3 gigawatt DC of new PPAs last year. In addition, we added EPC scope to 500 megawatts of previously booked module sales, which combined with our development bookings positions us to meet or exceed our targeted 1 gigawatt per year systems business. Our 2018 bookings were also highlighted the strong demand for utility-scale solar from C&I customers. Approximately 500 megawatts of our total 1.3 gigawatts of development project bookings where PPA signed with the utilities were corporate customers are the intended consumers of the energy to be generated by these projects.  Additionally, this trend has continued into 2019 with our recent booking of a nearly 150 megawatts PPA with a corporate customer. We expect corporate demand for solar projects to continue to grow in coming years and we believe that our strong reputation and ability to offer turnkey solutions will position us to compete effectively for future opportunities.  International wins were a meaningful portion of our 2018 bookings with more than 700 megawatts booked primarily in Europe. While strong domestic demand for our Series 6 product has limited our ability to support international market opportunities, we expect international bookings to grow as we continue to invest in our regional sales team and add planned Series 6 capacity.  2018 was a record year for O&M bookings as we added nearly 3.5 gigawatts of new business bringing our total O&M fleet under contract to over 11 gigawatts at the end of the year. We remain encouraged by the opportunities to continue growing O&M and to leverage the fixed cost associated with this business.  From a manufacturing perspective, we made progress starting and ramping Series 6 capacity over the course of 2018. During the year, we started production at three Series 6 factories which collectively manufactured a combined 0.7 gigawatt DC of modules. The production runrate at these factories at the end of 2018 was over 2 gigawatts which is a significant achievement considering initial production did not begin until April. Construction of our four Series 6 factory was completed in late 2018 and recently started production.  Lastly, our fifth factory is under construction and progressing according to plan with an anticipated start of production in January 2020. To concurrently manage all the activities related to the construction, start-up and ramp of the five different factories with a major undertaking that positions us to meet our strong demand for Series 6 in 2019.  Also note is in the late 2018, we reached the 20 gigawatt shipment milestone. This reflects cumulative shipments since the founding of First Solar and highlights the extensive deployment of our cad-tel technology worldwide. Overall, our operational and financial results in 2018 have created a solid platform as we move into 2019.  Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019ll next discuss our most recent bookings in greater detail. In total, our net bookings since the prior earnings call in late October were 1.6 gigawatts including 1.3 gigawatts which were booked since the beginning of January. After accounting for shipments of approximately 900 megawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments which now extends into 2023 are 12.1 gigawatts.  Our most recent bookings include two PPAs that were signed totally more than 300 megawatts DC. The first of these PPAs was signed with MCE for the expansion of the Little Bear project in California. The second PPA was signed with a major utility customer in the Western United States, and the project will support a collaboration between the utility and its corporate buyers to meet the renewable energy objectives.  Included in our new module bookings is a greater-than 1 gigawatt agreement with a major customer in the United States for shipments in 2021 and beyond timeframe. This booking highlights the continued strong demand for Series 6 in the United States, particularly as certain customers look for opportunities to safe harbor modules to preserve the higher ITC.  While we are pleased with our 2018 bookings of 5.6 gigawatts and the greater-than 2 to 1 book-to-ship ratio, it\u2019s important to put our 2019 bookings expectations into perspective. Relative to our module competitors, we are in extremely favorable position essentially being filled out over the next eight quarters.  Generally, our customers, particularly in the international markets do not contract for module supply multiple years in advance, given the project development cycle and the time horizon in which they have project certainty. While we are encouraged by our bookings year-to-date, and target a 1 to 1 book-to-ship ratio in 2019, our bookings maybe more back-end loaded given our available supply is in the 2021 and beyond period. On the O&M side, as we highlighted earlier, in 2018, we added nearly 3.5 gigawatts of new projects, a high percentage of these bookings was attributed to third-party wins defined as projects where we are not the developer, but in which many cases include our module technology. Third-party O&M not only expands our addressable market, but also helps to create economies of scale for our O&M business.  Some of the reasons for our continuing success in winning third-party business are highlighted by an example of how we are able to leverage our O&M expertise to address the customers\u2019 need in a way our competition was not able. In 2018, we were approached by a customer seeking help with two large utility-scale solar power plants in its portfolio that were under contracts with a competing O&M provider and were underperforming. These projects utilized our competing module technology and were not constructed by First Solar EPC. Based on the customer\u2019s experience with our O&M services, they asked us to investigate cause of the underperformance. By leveraging our industry-leading expertise, as our O&M team we identified the root cause of the underperformance and created a detailed action plan to improve performance. The recommended corrective actions are expected to improve the annual energy output of the combined plant by approximately 3%, which translates into more than $1 million of annual revenue to the owner. As we continue to leverage our significant O&M experience to meet customer needs, we expect that third-party wins will continue to be a key part of our growing O&M fleet.  Slide 6. And I\u2019ll provide an updated view of our mid to late-stage bookings opportunity which now totaled 7.3 gigawatts DC, a decrease of approximately 500 megawatts from the prior quarter primarily as a result of our strong recent bookings. However, when factoring in the bookings for the quarter, 1.4 gigawatts of which were included as opportunities in the prior quarter, our mid to late-stage pipeline actually grew by approximately 900 megawatts DC. North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 5.5 gigawatts DC. However, Europe has shown a meaningful increase since the prior quarter driven by resurge in markets in France and Spain. Opportunities in Asia-Pac region have remained relatively stable. Even with the more than 300 megawatts of recent systems bookings, our potential systems opportunities remains strong at 1.8 gigawatts DC. These potential systems bookings are comprised of projects in the U.S. and over 300 megawatts in Japan.  Continuing on to Slide 7, I\u2019ll next provide an update on our Series 6 capacity rollout. The most notable achievement to highlight since our prior earnings call is the start of Series 6 production at our second Vietnam factory, our fourth Series 6 factory in total. As mentioned previously, production commenced in early January, several weeks ahead of our target start date.  Similar to our first Vietnam factory, the initial ramp has been accelerated relative to the previous facility by applying the cumulative learnings which including starting production with an improved module framing tool. Construction is continuing at our second Series 6 factory in Ohio. As announced previously, we expect to start production in early 2020 and construction is on track to our schedule.  Once completed, we will have five factories with annual Series 6 capacity of 5.6 gigawatts, an impressive accomplishment since announcing the transition to Series 6 in November of 2016. Since the third quarter earnings call, we have seen steady improvement in our Series 6 throughput and wattage across our entire fleet. When comparing February\u2019s month-to-date performance to the month of October, you can see the significant improvements made.  Note, our second Vietnam factory is excluded from this comparison as it was not operational in the base comparison period. Megawatts produced per day is up 65%. Capacity utilization has increased 30 percentage points. The production yield is up 7 percentage points. And finally, the average watt per module has increased 2 amps or 10 watts.  Since October, the percentage of modules with anti-reflective coating has increased 33 points. These significant accomplishments can be credited to the outstanding work of our engineering and manufacturing associates.  We are encouraged by the meaningful progress we have made over the last months of 2018 and how we started 2019. We continue to plan for full year production of between 5.2 and 5.5 gigawatts. As a reminder, this target production includes approximately 2 gigawatts of Series 4 module. In order to meet these production commitments, we continue to rollout tool upgrades and optimize the production line throughput across the various sites.  This is a dynamic process that continued to incorporate learnings from each of the factories as we have ramped and is moving according to schedule.  I would like to make one final point before I hand the call over to Alex. I mentioned in October, First Solar was a sponsor to an innovative study by E3 which highlighted the value of flexible solar to utilities in the form of expected reduced fuel and maintenance cost or conventional generation, reduced curtailment of solar output and reduced air emission.  This study has been published. We have been pleased with the positive response and feedback from across the industry. For example, Public Utilities Fortnightly, a leading industry publication recognized the study as one of the 2018 top innovators. Our efforts to demonstrate our thought leadership are not only limited to the United States, recently, we supported this study by Solar Power Europe that provides evidence to support the benefits of utilizing low-cost utility-scale solar to keep the European grids stable and reliable. Efforts such as this will take on increasing importance in order for the European Union to meet its 2030 renewable energy targets and we look forward to remaining engaged in that process. Whether in the United States, Europe or other regions, we will continue to provide support and thought leadership to advance the understanding of how utility-scale solar enhances the reliability of power grids around the world.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Alex who will provide more detail on our fourth quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2019. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before getting into the financials for the quarter in detail, I\u2019ll first provide additional context around the factors that led to 2018 results falling below our guidance. There were four key issues that impacted our ability to meet earnings guidance. Firstly, 2018 net sales were $100 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance due to the timing of module sales and delays in systems revenue recognition. The lower systems revenue is associated with inclement weather and also material delivery delays to the projects.  Secondly and thirdly as Mark mentioned earlier, we experienced increased EPC cost across several U.S. projects partially driven by schedule acceleration to achieve year-end customer milestones. And we experienced elevated inbound freight costs to expedite raw materials to Series 6 production. And fourthly, 2018 ramp and related costs were $113 million compared to our guidance of $100 million.  So, with that context in mind, I\u2019ll begin by discussing some of the income statement highlights for the fourth quarter and full year on Slide 9. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $691 million, an increase of $15 million compared to the prior quarter. The higher net sales were primarily a result of the sales of two projects in Japan. For full year 2018, net sales were $2.2 billion and as mentioned relative to our guidance expectations, net sales were lower due to the timing of both module sales and delays in system revenues.  As a percentage of total quarterly net sales our systems revenue in Q4 was 83% which was nearly flat compared to Q3. For the full year 2018, 78% of net sales came from our systems business compared to 73% in 2017.  Gross margin was 14% in the fourth quarter and was impacted by ramp charges of $44 million as well as in-bound freight costs and EPC acceleration costs. For the full year, gross margin was 18%, an increase of $113 million of ramp and related charges which equates to a 5% sequential impact. The systems segment margin was 22% in the fourth quarter and the module segment margin was a negative 25%. And as it relates to the module segment gross margin, keep in mind that sales were composed almost entirely of Series 4 volume and Series 6 volume continues to be allocated almost entirely to our systems business.  However, the module segment cost of sales was composed with both Series 4 after sales and series 6 ramp-related cost of $44 million. Adjusted to the impact of ramp-related costs, Series 4 module gross margin was in line with our expectations.  Operating expenses were $87 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $17 million compared to Q3. Q3 OpEx benefited from a reduction to our module collection and recycling liability, while Q4 was impacted by higher SG&A from project-related expenses. For 2018, operating expenses of $352 million neared the midpoint of our guidance range.  Now highlighting our efficient management of OpEx in 2018, our combined SG&A and R&D expense decreased approximately $30 million or 10% versus 2017. Operating income was $11 million in the fourth quarter and $40 million for the full year. Compared to our guidance for the year, Op income was lower than planned as a result of the lower revenue and higher cost of sales discussed. Other income was $32 million in the fourth quarter from the gain on sale of certain restricted investments. Investments in solar associated with our module collection and recycling program and was seldom parts reimbursed of the funded amounts.  Note that the smaller side of restricted investments for similar purposes was completed earlier this year in 2019 were reflected in our first quarter results. We recorded a tax benefit of $4 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we recorded tax expense of approximately $3 million. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.54 in the third quarter. For the full year, earnings per share was $1.56. EPS was below the low-end of our guidance range due to the timing of revenue recognitions to certain module and systems sales and the higher EPC ash rate and ramp costs discussed earlier.  I\u2019ll next turn to Slide 10 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow summation. While cash and marketable securities balance at year-end was $2.5 billion, a decrease of approximately $183 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position decreased by a similar amount to $2.1 billion at the midpoint of our guidance range.  The decrease in our cash balance is primarily related capital investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity, factory ramp activities and the timing of cash receipts from certain systems project sales. Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $467 million, virtually unchanged from the prior quarter. Within the quarter, project debt issued to fund our project construction in Japan and Australia was essentially offset by liabilities assumed by the buyers of two Japan projects sold.  Nearly all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the project is sold. Net working capital in Q4, which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by $178 million versus the prior quarter. The change was primarily due to an increase in module inventory which is related to a capacity ramp and unbilled accounts receivables.  Cash flows used in operations were $186 million in the fourth quarter and $327 million for the full year. As a reminder, when we sell an asset with project level debt that is assumed by the buyer, the operating cash flow associated with the sale is less than if the buyer not received the debt.  In Q4, our projects assumed $124 million of liabilities related to these transactions, and for the full year that totaled $241 million. Capital expenditures were $129 million in the fourth quarter compared to $238 million in the prior quarter due to the timing of spending on Series 6 capacity. For the full year, capital expenditures were $740 million compared to $662 million invested in Series 6 capacity expansion. Cumulatively, Series 6 expenditures incurred at the end of 2018 were $1.1 billion.  Continuing on Slide 11, I\u2019ll next discuss the updated assumptions associated with our 2019 guidance. We are largely maintaining our guidance ranges for the year with minor adjustments to ramp and start-up costs which had an offsetting impact from gross margin and operating expenses. While these changes are relatively small, there are couple of important points to highlight. Firstly, there has been recently significant focus around the BG&E bankruptcy and impacts the company that have contracted all stake agreements with PG&E.  First Solar has one 75 megawatt AC project where PG&E is the contracted offtaker. However, believe any risk associated with this asset is limited, given the project size, total development capital invested today, and the competitive PPA price where First Solar could potentially have greater exposure in several unsold projects where SCE is the contracted offtaker. We are currently in the process of marking some of these assets to sale and to the extent five of these projects assume any increased risk premiums associated with SCE as the offtaker, this could result in lower project value. Although we don\u2019t see this as a significant to the sale value of these projects given their competitive PPA prices, and the key market interest the contracted solar assets that we\u2019ve seen in recent potential sale processes, it is an item we think should be highlighted.  Secondly, we are lowering our gross margin guidance by 50 basis points to a revised range of 19.5% to 20.5% as a result of higher expected ramp costs. Offsetting the decrease in gross margin is a $15 million reduction to start-up costs within our operating expense guidance. The increase in ramp costs and offsetting decrease in start-up costs are result of the earlier-than planned started production at our second Vietnam factory.  Revised range of ramp-related charges is now $35 million to $45 million and plants start-up is $75 million to $85 million. Combined ramp and start-up costs of $110 million to $130 million are unchanged from our prior forecast.  Thirdly, if reemphasize you on our December outlook call, the profile of earnings is expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year. Slide 12 contains two charts that illustrates from a revenue and cost perspective some of the factors that are expected to impact the quarterly earnings distribution.  In both cases, we are not providing the actual volume sold or actual module cost per watt, only the relative percentages. The first chart shows Series 6 module, third-party sales by quarter. Notably, only 10% of the volume sold in the first quarter and only 25% in the first half of the year. Not surprisingly the supply increases across the year, we expect through the volumes of sales increase in Q3 and Q4.  The second graphic shows the quarterly profile of our Series 6 module cost per watt produced relative to the 2019 full year average. The data illustrates the cost per watt for the first quarter of 2019 which has the lowest throughput and module wattage levels for the year is projected to be approximately 30% higher than the 2019\u2019s full year average.  Module cost per watt is expected to improve in the second quarter but will still be 5% higher than the average. The greatest benefit of our improved ramps and efficiency is anticipated in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, the cost per watt is expected to be 5% below and in the fourth quarter 10% below the 2019 full year average.  In addition to the Series 6 sales and customer profile, there are two additional factors which we expect to contribute to lower earnings in the first half of the year. The first is the timing of ramps and start-up challenges which are heavily weighted to Q1 and Q2. We expect more than $40 million of combined ramp and start-ups in the first quarter. The second factor is the timing of project development sales, similar to our expectation at the time of our December outlook call, project and development sales are expected to be weighted to the second half of the year. And we also expect to close the sale of our Ishikawa project in Japan in the fourth quarter.  Taking all of these factors into account, points to why I expect both a loss in the first quarter whereas low earnings in Q2 with the majority of earnings coming in the second half of the year. For the full year, we still see EPS guidance in the range of $2.25 and $2.75 driven by Series 6 production ramps and cross border improvements as the technology continues to scale.  And finally., I\u2019ll summarize our fourth quarter and 2018 progress on Slide 13. So as we had earnings per share of $1.36 and year end net cash of $2.1 billion. Secondly, we had continued success adding to our contract supply plan in 2018 with net module bookings of 5.6 gigawatts. For the year-to-date 2019 module bookings were approximately 1.3 gigawatts, we are off to a positive start for the year. Thirdly, we continue to make good progress on our Series 6 capacity roadmap. Early this year we started the production of second Vietnam factory ahead of schedule and we continue to make steady improvements in both throughput and module wattage at our other Series 6 facilities. Our progress thus far in 2018 \u2013 2019 indicates we remain on track to our combined Series 4 and Series 6 production target of 5.2 gigawatts to 5.5 gigawatts.  And lastly, our 5% net neutral movement between ramp and start-up costs between COGS and OpEx while maintaining our financial guidance ranges for the year including our EPS range for 2019 of $2.25 to $2.75. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to check in with you on your shipments to customers now that you are shipping currently some of our checks indicate that you may be falling 5 watts per module short in your shipments to customers versus contractual requirements or obligations and this maybe resulting in extra costs. We could be wrong on this one but want to just check in with you on this.  Can you comment on whether or not this may or may not be happening and if true, can you provide some color on this and perhaps talk about how long the issue may endure ahead? Thanks. Mark Widmar : Yes, so, I think the premise of the question is we want to make it clear that falling short of contractual obligations. We are not falling short of any of our contractual obligations relative to comments of the customers and the product which we need to ship to them. We have as we said before, we have been adders and been deductor.  So, we have a contracted commitment that we anchor around it\u2019s extent \u2013 it\u2019s higher or lower than there is bin adjustment to the price accordingly for that delta could be up or could be down. So, I just want to make sure that that\u2019s clear. There is nothing that we are doing that would say that we are falling short of our contractual obligation, but to the extent we do have deliver that\u2019s been down would be 5 watts then there would be bin adjustment to the price.  And that is happening in some cases and part of it was \u2013 I think we indicated on prior calls is that the early production and in particular we\u2019ve been struggling to see the increased penetration of arc. And so, without arc you are going to lose almost two bins of volume. And one of the things we said on the call is our arc penetration has increased now 33 percentage points.  So, we are seeing a much better utilization for arc and as a result of that as we go forward and we continue to ramp across the balance of the fleet, some of the early launch issues that we have will be subsided and we\u2019ll be able to make sure that we hit the committed bin that we initially structured around but I want to make sure it\u2019s clearly understand that to the extent that the bin is slightly above or below the contract allows for that. And there is appropriate adjustment to the ASP. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Kristen Owen : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Kristen on for Colin. You talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks, but can you provide some additional color on the geographic diversity of the backlog on an annual basis?  Just sort of the mix of domestic versus international? And then, what opportunities are you seeing to pick up broken projects for the systems business in the U.S.? sort of correlated to that what the expertise in integrating - your expertise in integrating solar with storage to your pricing strategy for modules? Mark Widmar : Okay. A lot there. When you look at the geographic diversity of our shipments for and some of this will come out in the Q \u2013 K actually it will come out tomorrow. You will see that there is a high concentration of module shipments that occurred within in the U.S. in the range of 70% or so of the shipments last year were in the U.S. and the balance were in international markets.  And again it\u2019s largely reflective of where the strength of the demand is and if you look at our pipeline as you carry forward of the 7 gigawatts of \u2013 opportunities about 5.5 of that sits within the U.S. The volumes at which we booked this quarter were largely U.S. we had some volume with a European customer. But most of the call it, 1.6 since the last earnings call was focused around the U.S. and it largely has to do with where our customers are willing to commit. And I think it\u2019s important to understand that, of the large order that came through this year, again lot of the 1.3.  That volume is to be shipped in 2021, 2022 and 2023. You will see customers in the U.S. because of certainty around the ITC and wanting to safe harbor, you will see customers having a greater appetite to commit forward and to procure materials that go out that far in the horizon.  When you look at some of the international markets, we don\u2019t see as many customers willing to start procuring in 2021, 2022 and 2023, as part of their lack of certainty of the underlying projects or for those modules and where they would go. And so, what we said in the call is that, part of the thinking, when we look at the bookings for the year, we started off great and we still look to have a 1 to 1 book-to-ship ratio, which you say that we are targeting to book somewhere between 5.5 or 6 gigawatts this year.  We may see some of that being more back-end loaded, because, I do see more diversity of the bookings as we progress throughout the year being more opportunities in our international markets, because we are getting to a horizon that towards the end of 2019 we are looking to ship into customers and starting in 2021 that we can see the international customer participating in that opportunity.  So I would expect our bookings as we progress throughout the year to improve having more of a diversity to U.S. versus international. But at the same time as long as we are still relatively capacity constrained, while it\u2019s important that we continue to grow and develop our international markets if we have opportunities to capture better value in the U.S. markets we will prioritize the U.S. market, we may prioritize some of the international markets that are \u2013 better opportunities to capture higher ASPs.  We will focus there first before maybe we chase some of the other markets that we know traditionally have been low ASP markets. On the storage question, we\u2019ll let me go on the systems question first. I think, in particular in the U.S., there is a lot that\u2019s in the market right now. As you can see, there is a lot of smaller developers and others that are trying to actively market and to sell their development pipeline some with contracted assets, some not.  And I do think that some of that could be related to the capacity of some of the smaller developers to make the investments to capture the IT safe harbor. And as we indicated in our last call, we will be investing somewhere call it $300 million to $400 million to secure call it 5 gigawatts of opportunities between now and 2023. That\u2019s a big investment and I think some of the smaller developers maybe constrained with making those investments and I think they understand that if they don\u2019t make those investments, they will be less competitive as they are competing for projects that as those deals that go through the end of 2023.  So I can see a lot coming to market and we are trying to at least get engaged and evaluate and see if some of those opportunities make sense for us and clearly we\u2019ve got a great development team and we\u2019ve proven ourselves with our ability to make acquisitions and integrate development assets and contract them and realize meaningful value associated with that. So, that\u2019s a good opportunity for us.  And then, storage, we are actively involved in our largest storage deal we announced a few quarters ago with AVS. We\u2019ve got a couple of other projects and recently awarded of a project with the utility in Florida to do a pilot for them, a small additional storage on to their array. We\u2019ve done some work with utility in Nevada on the same type of opportunity where the customers are exploring and learning and wanting to know more about storage and how it can be effectively integrated and it\u2019s an area of emphasis of focus for us. I look at it somewhat of extension to our normal systems business and just part of our offer.  And we can add enhanced value through our power plant controls and optimization of how we charge the battery and dispatch the battery and we\u2019ve proven some capabilities there that\u2019s been very interesting to some of our customers in that regard. So, it\u2019s still early innings. We\u2019ve picked up some wins and I see momentum as we move forward as it relates to storage. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you. Perhaps just to pick up where you left off, if you can clarify a little bit your comments just now about securing up the backlog here from an ITC perspective, A, how do you think about that accelerating into the year end 2019 given that is the timeline that you need to meet to get the qualify that ITC. And then, secondly, I think you alluded to a gigawatt utility customer in the quarter who they were trying themselves to try to lock up some supply. So, maybe as you think about the potential orders from what you haven\u2019t locked in from an ITC perspective, is that another source of bookings acceleration in the back half? Alex Bradley : Yes, I\u2019ll just start with what we are looking at from a safe harbor perspective to ourselves. Similar today to what we\u2019ve talked about on our guidance call in December. So, we are still looking at somewhere between $325 million and $375 million of spend this year.  We haven\u2019t expressly talked about what we are going to spend that on, it\u2019s less likely to be on the module side just given the constraints we have in module supply as Mark said, we are largely sold out for the rest of the year. So, we will look at the rest of the balance upfront. There will be some projects that were far enough along that we can use the technical work there.  And so, a small piece of that midpoint 350 number that I talked about will be associated with technical working cut. And that will probably be in the range of $25 million to $50 million. The rest we\u2019ll look to spend on \u2013 as I mentioned balance of plant with projects that go out into 2021 from a contracted perspective and then uncontract supplies will take about on that 2021 timeframe. The other thing we said from our perspective is that if there is opportunity to spend more, to the point if we are able to pick up projects where other developers are constrained from a capital perspective, and securing type of material, it\u2019s somewhere we would be very happy to invest additional capital. I believe the returns are good.  So it\u2019s somewhere, where if we see the right opportunity, when you can spend more than that $375 million top-line that we talked about. Mark Widmar : And then, from a customer standpoint, Julien, I mean, the order that we secured here was with one customer, it\u2019s the common conversation that our team is having with a lot of our customers and thinking about the safe harbor and how to - what their particular strategy is, and engaging in conversations with us around that and how we could try to evolve that.  In some cases \u2013 and this customer is \u2013 and they already had a commitments to some volume for this year. So, we didn\u2019t have to \u2013 it wasn\u2019t an issue of not having the supply, but what we were able to do is that since we already had contractually had volume on the books for this customer, we then engage with them, or leverage that as your safe harbor anchor and then commit the volumes that\u2019s out in the horizon and when you construct the projects in 2021, 2022 and 2023.  So, Alex is right. We are constrained as it relates to the available supply. Now, starting up Vietnam a little bit faster than \u2013 Vietnam too little faster because there is a little bit of supply. If we continue to ramp, accordingly, we may see a little bit of opportunity there. Those are small in the rounding. The bigger opportunity I see is, how do we talk to customers today, that have contracted volume that\u2019s on the books and then how do we position that as the anchor for the ITC and then contractually commence with the volume that would sit out and deliver in the 2021, 2022, and 2023 timeframe. So, we are having a number of conversations with customers in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Hi, thanks guys. So I have three questions. First of all, like sites flow, it\u2019s kind of confusing. Could you help me through that? And then, just talk about the cost reduction versus the 40% that you said back at Analyst Day, like you are plus or minus a penny or two from there.  Number two, I understand that costs pull forward, but I don\u2019t see megawatts going up. And then, number three, could you just talk about how you are pricing some of these out year contracts? Just because, that we have a hard time going with ASPs we got to 2022. So, how do you think about pricing? Thanks. Alex Bradley : Yes, just to explain the graphs a bit more detail. That the graph in the left-hand side of Slide 12 is showing you the Series 6 third-party volumes. If you think about the guidance we gave, the 5.3 to 5.5 gigawatts for the year, you take out couple of gigawatts of Series 4 and then you got to take out the systems piece. So, you are left with what is Series 6 through third-party module deliveries. And when you take that total number, we are saying, this is the break down per quarter of the delivery of those modules. So, that 10% of that third-party Series 6 volume is delivered in Q1, 15% in Q2, 30% in Q3, and 45% in Q4. This really kind of show that on a third-party module delivery basis, we're back-ending the profile pretty significantly in the year.  On the right-hand side, looking at the cost, so, the question you had around cost, we talked in the guidance call around long-term or end of year Series 6 cost being approximately 40% lower than our 2015 benchmark for Series 4 with a roughly penny adder associated with increased cost around the frame. So if you take that point over the end of the year, I\u2019d say, that\u2019s a year ending point. You can look at what you think the full year average is.  We are trying to make the point that on the average basis, for 2019, you are going to see whatever that average is, it be significantly higher in Q1 as the module is delivered it comes down to Q2 and by the time you get to Q3, you are fractionally under the year average by Q4 your 10% under the year average.  So again, when you combine these two, the left-hand side lower volume beginning of the year, the right-hand side, higher cost relative to the average, you are going to see pretty negative impact to the results of Q1 and Q2. And you start to see that when you have much higher volume and much lower cost in Q3 and Q4. Mark Widmar : Yes, I think, the way I would say there is \u2013 Ben, your question about, our view around the 40% off of our Series 4 reference point plus for the penny or so, penny or two for framing piece, there is a couple of smaller components. That's effectively where we anticipate it to be and nothing has changed there and we are working on opportunities where we can even revise the frame and even take more cost out there because between the frame and it\u2019s easy to go assets really where the vast majority of the build material is and the team is working pretty aggressively on finding a roadmap to figure out we get everything back to the whole entitlement of what we had and there is some encouraging work being done from that standpoint.  The other thing I\u2019ll say about that slide is that, one of the biggest levers that moves you from where numbers 20%, 30% higher is in the first quarter versus the average and then trends down to being 10% lower than the average, a big piece of that is the throughput, all right? Because there is a still a significantly amount of under utilization that sits in the first half of the year.  And then as we drive that under utilization down, we are at full entitlement across the entire fleet. As you know, we are starting up another factory now. And so, we are going to be \u2013 utilization while it\u2019s significantly higher upon launch after the first month or so of production relative to our other factories.  It\u2019s still going to be driving this down and there will be some under utilization cost that\u2019s going to be weighing down on the overall average across the fleet. So that's a piece of it.  And then the other is the efficiency improvements. So we will continue to see improvements as we progress from where we are now to the end of the year and it will pick up close to another two bins from the launching point where we are right now to the exit rate that\u2019s close to that from Q1 to Q4. So, those are tipping drivers of that cost forward. The contracts for the outer year in the pricing around that, Ben, we look at \u2013 we capture the fair value, right, and pricing as we go out into 2021, 2022, and 2023, we have a roadmap of where we know where we go with our cost, we know our efficiency is going to be, we know at the energy advantage is going to be at that point of time.  We\u2019ve priced it accordingly. And I am very happy with. We have now quite a bit of volume. Obviously, a lot of volume sits at 2021, 2022, and 2023, but I am pretty happy with the pricing that our team has been able to capture in that window.  It\u2019s above where my expectations would have been relative to the business case we\u2019ve put together for our Series 6 that we are pretty pleased from that standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two from me, I guess, first on that sort of capacity point. You mentioned in mid-December when you gave the guidance for 2019 that you putting Malaysia one conversion to Series 6 on hold. And you\u2019ve mentioned capacity constraints and now you are talking about 2023 deliveries throughout this call.  So, given that backdrop, what\u2019s sort of the decision process around bringing that back into the capacity expansion roadmap here? And then, second question just on Slide 12, super helpful with the cadence. Alex, can you help us think about how that average line moves into 2020 with some of the utilization effect starting to fall off and then getting full earned entitlement around the efficiency targets and so forth and so on. Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : I\u2019ll take the capacity and then Alex could take the other one. So, Brian, as we said, when we \u2013 at the end of this year, we will ramp down two of our factories in Malaysia. We will immediately start the transition of one of them. The other one is continuing to be evaluated and it\u2019s really being evaluated based off of market demand and our ability to capture the bookings that we need in 2021 to get a high level of confidence or ability to sell through that volume.  And so, it\u2019s really, it\u2019s demand-related, demand-driven and as we continue to book, then we will somewhat crystallize our decision around that and we\u2019ll get more and more comfortable. Why we\u2019ll say though is that, every one of those factories that comes up in essence creates pricing power, because it creates scale.  And that scale enables us to enhance our competitive position and then it allows us to capture volume in other markets that we may not be participating in today. So, I am very motivated to get that factory up and running. But it\u2019s highly dependent upon our ability to clear the market, acceptable margins and if we continue to do that, then I think the likelihood of starting that conversion on that second plants and really be on a third Series 6 factory in Malaysia will start to crystallize. Alex Bradley : And Brian. I can\u2019t give you guidance on that far, so, what I can say, I guess, is that, as Mark mentioned, a lot of the cost, majority of the cost sits between the two pieces of glass on the frame. So that\u2019s where we are going to be spending a lot of our time. On both, so, on the frame, we are impacted by the tariffs. We are looking to optimize the frame further.  So, we had some movements in the frame in terms of design from where we originally came out with Series 6 and some of the modules we produced. So we are looking at can we optimize design to use less aluminum in that frame.  On the glass side, we mentioned on our guidance call in December that we had some projects that we are looking at that may impact start up and one of those we talked a little bit of that was trying to optimize some of the glass. So we today pay more specialized processing on that glass and that\u2019s something we need to bring in-house to try and optimize pricing. So, we are continuing to work that route on the glass side and on the frame side both. And then, beyond that, we will continue to work the rest of other materials. But a lot of that will get come from increased scale. With scale, we get pricing power and we get efficiency and lot change as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yes, thanks. Couple of questions. You saw some revenue recognition slip to 2019, but you didn\u2019t raised the revenue numbers for 2019. I am wondering if it\u2019s something due to PG&E and SC&E or whether it's supply constraints, perhaps you can just talk us through the puts and takes there is why you didn\u2019t increase the 2019 revenue guidance?  The other question I\u2019ve got is that the ramp cost seems to be increasing. I listened to the first \u2013 the guidance you gave for 2019. What changed? If you can just sort of talk us through the process by which we gotten here? Thanks. Mark Widmar : Yes. So, on the guidance piece, we've got a broad range in the guidance since we just talked about on Slide 12 a significant amount of the revenue and margin is back-ended for the year. So, obviously that\u2019s in the fact that we have a guidance range, but you can see the small changes in timing could have large impact to results at the back-end of the year. There is some risk around SCE. When we think about SCE and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant risk for us. It\u2019s hard to evaluate. You got to look at what\u2019s happening with PG&E itself. How California and FERC and the bankruptcy courts will deal with that and then, how that specifically applies to the fact on circumstances around SCE in their territory. So we are monitoring that. We do have assets that we are selling this year. We have three assets \u2013 currently running at competitive process, we are seeing high demand for those. If you look at SCE\u2019s credit today, the bonds still range at investment grade. You haven\u2019t seen the yields that widen incrementally. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 gap like you have on PG&E. So I think we\u2019ve got good confidence, but there is still risk around those processes. So that's a piece of it. But then the other piece is we just \u2013 we are at only eight weeks into the air. So, that will need to make a change in terms of overall guidance. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate guidance as we go into 2019.  On the ramp piece specifically, all you are seeing is a change in geography from start-up moving into ramp and it\u2019s a function of the timing that\u2019s bringing up the Vietnam factory. So, effectively, we\u2019ve decreased start-up, bring that up early, but it\u2019s increased ramp and you see that in the half percentage point change in the gross margin guidance and that\u2019s offset by a $15 million decrease in the start-up cost in the OpEx.  So, those two net out to zero change to guidance. It\u2019s just geography based on the timing as the Vietnam plant coming up. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Maheep Mandloi : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Maheep Mandloi on behalf of Michael. Given your shipment visibility, can you talk about how much of the third-party sales is fixed or is that fixed what the floating price is for the year? And the second question is on the Series 6 cost structure. Can you talk about when you expect to achieve these target cost structure? Is it still a Q4 target? Thanks. Mark Widmar : So, as it relates to shipment visibility and the pricing, all of the \u2013 anything that we recognize as a booking has a firm price associated with it. The only impact that it has is, we\u2019ve referenced this before. If we deliver a bin that\u2019s higher than what we initially anchored towards, right, so the contract, we\u2019ll say \u2013 let\u2019s use an example.  You have to deliver a 420 watt module. We can go down two bins the 410 and then we can up two bins to 430 or we can average to the 420 whatever the math ends up working out to. And those there will be subtle price deltas as you move across. In some cases, that\u2019s like, a quarter percent for each bin. In some cases it\u2019s slightly higher than that.  So there could be slight movements in the realized ASP from what the center point of that contract is, but it\u2019s a firm fixed price. So they all have firm fixed price. There is no floating, but for wherever the final delivery is of the product.  On the Series 6 cost structure, as we said in the last call, as we exit this year, we\u2019ll be within a couple of pennies from our targeted 40% cost reduction. And that\u2019s important and as we get there, we saw of an issue with the frames that fully optimized and the glass, we got issues and we got a path of how to improve that.  And the other is, we are not at the average efficiency that we hadn\u2019t targeted for Series 6, right. So, we knew it was going to take us a couple years and we even showed a slide I think in the Analyst Day of kind of where that average efficiency would be and then we show a more of a mid-term objective of where we want to go with the real wattage for the product.  So, a combination of optimizing around the glass, the frame and driving the efficiency, we will be in a much better position as we exit 2020. Should be relatively in line with what our original targeted cost reduction was when launched Series 6 and again, we launched it in November of 2016. So, it\u2019s only a little over three years since \u2013 or two years I guess, little over two years.  We are not even three years into the journey. So, just put it that perspective and I think tremendous progress that\u2019s been made over that horizon. Operator : Your final question comes from Joseph Osho with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Joseph Osho : Well I made it. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the margin comments you made about the systems versus the module business in particular the comments about Series 4. I understand that obviously you\u2019ve got more six allocated to your systems business.  But I am wondering if there is any underloading on the four business that\u2019s weighing on those margins, and also how much that might play out as you ramp the business down? Alex Bradley : Yes, you are not seeing any underloading on the Series 4. What you are seeing is just the impact of the fact that the Series 6 business is really - still nearly all being allocated over to the systems segment from a revenue perspective and from a core comps perspective.  But you are seeing all of the ramp costs coming through in the module segment. So you are seeing a blend of what looks like Series 4, but all Series 6 kind of non-core costs coming through as well. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. That it\u2019s not a function of that being any under utilization on the S4 piece. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Adrianna Defranco : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2019 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Adrianna. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by briefly discussing our EPS result for Q1. As we emphasized on our February earnings call, we expected that the combination of lower quarterly Series 6 sales and the higher Series 6 cost per watt relative to the full year average, as well as the timing of both ramp and startup charges, and the timing of project development sales would have the most acute impact to earnings in the first quarter. Our EPS results for the quarter was in part driven by these factors. However, the first quarter was also adversely impacted by some unanticipated non-Series 6 related costs. Alex will go into more detail, but one key area where we have seen significant recent challenges has been containing costs in our EPC business. These challenges include factors both external and internal to First Solar. Externally a higher-than-expected construction labor market and certain equipment supply issues produced a drag on profitability at several of our systems projects. We also encountered certain weather delays for which relief was not available under the EPC contract, which in turn put pressure on required milestones and other completion dates and correspondingly increased costs. From an internal perspective, our recent record of project cost management including subcontractor and vendor cost management failed to meet our expectations. Our EPC capability delivers strategic value to the company, but following a recent evaluation of these issues, we determined that restructuring of the EPC organization was prudent given these issues. Accordingly, we have installed new leadership of the EPC organization, merging our energy systems function with the engineering procurement and construction group. In addition, we are reviewing certain supplier and subcontractor arrangements and potential remedies with a view to addressing certain of these costs. Turning briefly to the market. Catalysts driving increased PV penetration continued to point to a strong global demand in 2019 and momentum building thereafter. For example in the U.S., there's a growing impetus to de-carbonize electricity. In the past months Washington state joined California, New Mexico, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. in an active legislation that mandates 100% clean electricity standard. Additionally, over a dozen other states have here put in place non-binding goals have introduced or are planning to introduce legislation with varying levels of clean energy commitments, or are committing to studying clean alternatives to their power generation portfolios. Corporate buyers are also increasingly looking for ways to de-carbonize their electricity. This is reflected in the fast-changing PPA landscape in the United States, which has seen an evolution in buyer types and transaction structures. We see a significant rise in corporate and commercial industrial PPA structures, with large technology companies dominating the market, but with growing interest from other sectors, such as health care, finance and even oil and gas. As part of our focus to accelerate growth in this segment, First Solar has joined the Board of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance, which has committed to establishing a clear path to its members to procure zero carbon electricity. This alliance's goal is to catalyze 60 gigawatts of new renewable energy for its members by 2025. Internationally, Europe has continued on its growth trajectory with 2019 potentially being a record year for PV installations. Initially, this year First Solar celebrates 15 years in Europe, with approximately 5 gigawatts of installed capacity across the region. This year, we expect European growth to be largely powered by the resurgence of the utility scale market in Spain, driven by economics and favorable policy. Spain is expected to add significant new capacity over the next several years. Additionally, France continues to procure utility-scale solar as part of its grid program. Globally all indicators point to growth underpinned by a combination of competitive economics of solar and a desire to de-carbonize electricity grids. Starting on slide 4. I'll provide an update on our Series 6 capacity rollout. As a reminder, we began production of our first Series 6 factory in April of 2018. Since then, we started production at three additional factories. Reflecting over this relatively short period of approximately one year and the significant progress we have made, we are pleased with where we are at Series 6 in terms of schedule, performance and cost. Since the February earnings call, we have seen significant operational improvements across our Series 6 factory. When comparing the performance of the month of February, which includes the first full month of our production of our second Vietnam factory to the performance of the month of April, meaningful improvements can be seen, despite certain planned downtime during the period. Megawatts produced per day is up 34%. Capacity utilization has increased 21 percentage points. Adjusted for planned downtime the April fleet capacity utilization was 90%. We expect higher-than-normal planned downtime to continue over the next couple of quarters as we continue to operationalize the full entitlement of our factories. Production yield is up two percentage points to approximately 90%. The average watt per module has increased slightly more than one bin or six watts. And finally, the percentage point of modules with anti-reflective coating has increased by 15 percentage points. And another noteworthy highlight relative to our Series 6 production expansion is the success we have experienced ramping our second Vietnam factory. The ramp has been accelerated relative to previous factories by applying accumulated learnings, including starting production with an improved module training tool. This benefit can be seen when comparing the initial three months of production of our most recent Vietnam factory to our first Series 6 factory in Ohio. Capacity utilization is 33 percentage points higher. Production yield is 32 percentage points higher. Average watts are up 19 watts or essentially four bins. And the arc penetration is 48 percentage points higher, leading to an equivalent watts produced being 125% higher. The progress we have made ramping our factories has been a key contributor in enabling us to achieve our first quarter Series 6 cost per watt objective. While this is a significant accomplishment, there is a tremendous amount of work still in front of us to achieve our cost per watt roadmap for the year. As we noted in our February earnings call, our expected Series 6 cost per watt will drop approximately 30% from Q1 to Q4. These significant accomplishments can be credited to the outstanding work of our engineering and manufacturing associates. Construction is continuing in our second Series 6 factory in Ohio. As announced previously, we expect to start production in early 2020 and construction is thus far on track to our schedule with the first tools scheduled to be installed by the end of Q2. Once completed, we will have five factories with an aggregate annual Series 6 capacity of 5.4 gigawatts, an impressive accomplishment since announcing the transition to Series 6 in November of 2016. We continue to be encouraged by the progress we have made over the last year. As noted previously, we planned portfolio production of between 5.2 gigawatts and 5.5 gigawatts. As a reminder, this targeted production includes approximately two gigawatts of Series 4 modules. In order to meet these production commitments, we continue to roll out two upgrades and optimize the production line throughput across the various sites. This is a dynamic process that continues to incorporate learnings from each of the factories, we have ramped and is moving according to schedule. Turning to slide 5. I'll next discuss our bookings activity since the last earnings call. In total, our net bookings since the last earnings call were 1.1 gigawatts. After accounting for shipments of approximately 900 megawatts during the first quarter, our expected future shipments are 12.2 gigawatts. Our most recent bookings are across multiple customers and include a limited volume of Series 4 for delivery at the end of 2019. The remaining Series 6 deliveries are split evenly between 2020 and 2021. In terms of geography, approximately 900 megawatts of the 1.1 gigawatts is for delivery to the United States with the remaining 200 megawatts flexible across the U.S. and certain international markets. With these recent bookings we have now added 2.3 gigawatts to the backlog since the beginning of the year. We are pleased with this momentum to-date and have increased confidence in exceeding our targeted 1 :1 book-to-ship ratio in 2019. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we are largely sold out through the end of 2020. With the current bookings now 50% of the anticipated Q1 2021 supply has been booked. As a reminder, given the timeframe for which we now have available product, we may see future bookings in 2019 to be weighted towards the back end of the year. Slide 6 provides an updated view on our mid to late-stage bookings opportunity, which now totals 6.6 gigawatts DC, a decrease of approximately 0.7 gigawatts from the prior quarter. However, when factoring in the bookings for the quarter approximately 0.3 of which were booked or were included in the opportunities in the prior quarter our mid to late-stage pipeline declined by 0.4 gigawatts DC. As a reminder, our mid to late-stage pipeline is reflective of those opportunities we feel could book within the next 12 months and is a subset of a much larger pipeline of opportunities, which totals approximately 12 gigawatts. This includes approximately two gigawatts of opportunities in 2019 and 2020, which will provide demand resiliency to our near-term production, while the remaining approximately 10 gigawatts of demand would be for module deliveries in 2021 and beyond. In terms of geographical breakdown of the mid to late-stage pipeline. North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 3.9 gigawatts DC. Europe represents approximately 2 gigawatts driven largely by resurgent markets in France and Spain with the remainder being across the Asia Pacific region. In terms of segment mix. Our mid to late-stage pipeline includes approximately 900 megawatts of systems opportunities across the U.S. and Japan with the remainder being module-only sales. I'll now turn the call over to Alex to provide more detail on our first quarter financial results and discuss updated guidance for 2019. Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Turning to slide 8, I'll start by covering the income statement highlights for the first quarter. Net sales in Q1 was $532 million a decrease of $159 million compared to the prior quarter. The lower net sales were primarily a result of lower systems projects revenue in the U.S. and Japan partially offset by higher module segment revenue. The percentage of total quarterly net sales of systems revenue in Q1 was 63% as compared to 83% in Q4 of 2018. Gross margin was breakeven in Q1 compared to 14% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The system segment gross margin was 8% in the first quarter and the module segment gross margin was negative 13%. As a reminder, module segment costs of sales comprise of all third-party module cost of sales as well as Series 6 ramp-related costs which as Mark mentioned earlier expected to be felt most acutely during the first half of the year. We experienced ramp-related charges of $36 million in the first quarter approximately 70% of the midpoint forecast for the full year. The system segment gross margin was impacted by $35 million related to the EPC business. This includes approximately $20 million related to our projects with Tampa Electric which were built with our Series 4 products. Challenge with these projects included tight construction schedules, labor shortages, non-force majeure weather-related work stoppages, failure by high-voltage transformer factory acceptance tests, the financial distress of a major subcontractor and certain rework. We've had some higher-than-projected costs and incurred some liquidated damages for failure to meet certain milestones. We had approximately $5 million of impact at our PV project for the inclusion of lower bid in Series 6 modules, a consequence of the earlier-than-expected start of our second Vietnam factory. Products initially produced in January was held pending release of our quality review process. This fully functional, but lower bin non-op product was used in our systems business as an alternative to scrapping it and incurring additional startup expense.  Whilst this increased costs, these are more than outweighed by the strategic value of having placed the second Vietnam factory online earlier than previously forecasted, providing optionality in terms of whip sharing across factories as well as the ability to run more engineering test sites work at our Perrysburg site over the course of the year.  The remaining approximately $10 million impact to gross margin was across our other projects in construction and was a result of greater-than-projected balance of systems cost related to the installation of low-bin modules, higher-than-forecast labor costs and certain project-specific construction costs. Operating expenses was $77 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $10 million compared to Q4 of 2018. This includes a reduction of $5 million in core SG&A and R&D spending and a $5 million reduction in plant startup expense which decreased from $15 million in Q4 2018 to $10 million in Q1. Given the anticipated startup timing of our second factory in Perrysburg, we expect startup cost to increase each quarter over the remainder of the year. We have an operating loss of $77 million in the first quarter compared to an operating profit of $11 million in the prior quarter. The reduction in operating income was a result of lower systems revenue and a higher EPC and ramp costs mentioned previously. Other income was $4 million in the first quarter primarily from the gain on sale of certain restricted investments associated with our module collection and recycling program partially offset by the impairment of a strategic investment for into Perovskites technology. Despite providing us with valuable insights into the development of Perovskites the investment was unable to hit certain internal milestones required for continued investment, resulting in an impairment of $5 million in the quarter. We took a mark-to-market charge of $5 million related to the fair value of certain interest rate swap contracts for some of our project assets in Japan and Australia. This is a timing impact based on movement of interest rates within the quarter and we expect to see a corresponding increase in project value recorded at the time of sale.  We recorded a tax benefit of $1 million in the first quarter compared to a tax benefit of $4 million in Q4 of 2018. Combination of the aforementioned items led to a first quarter loss per share of $0.64 compared to earnings per share of $0.49 in the fourth quarter of 2018. To summarize the key P&L themes from the quarter, we had a mix of expected and unexpected. As expected we had our lowest revenue quarter for the year our quarter with the lowest percentage of Series 6 sales relative to total module sales. The highest Series 6 cost per watt relative to the full year average and the highest quarterly combined ramp-related and startup expense. Not anticipated were the higher-than-forecast ramp and EPC costs, the Perovskites investment impairment and interest rate-related mark-to-market swap cost impacts referenced above. I'll next turn to slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash restricted cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at $2.3 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $500 million to $1.7 billion. The decrease in our cash balance is primarily related to capital investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity. Series 6manufacturing ramp and associated with working capital inventory costs and the timing of cash receipts from certain systems project sales. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $571 million compared to $467 million at the end of Q4 of 2018. Debt issuance was, of course, primarily associated with project development in Japan. And as a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the projects are sold. Net working capital in Q1 which includes the change in non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by $272 million versus the prior quarter. Change was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories. Cash flows used in operations were $303 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by the timing of systems business spend and cash receipts as well as increased spend ramping the Series 6 module business. And finally, capital expenditures were $149 million in the first quarter compared to $129 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as we continued Series 6 capacity expansion. Continuing on to slide 10. I'll next discuss the updated assumptions associated with our 2019 guidance. Firstly, our guidance continues to assume a back-ended Series 6 module sale profile with approximately 75% of Series 6 third-party module sales occurring in the second half of the year as well as a steep Series 6 cost-reduction profile over the year with Q1 and Q2 cost per watt approximately 30% and 5% respectively above the full year average. Secondly we continue to see ramp-related and startup charges weighted approximately 60% for the first half of the year. Thirdly, we assume the majority of system sales both in the U.S. and internationally will take place in the second half of the year. With regards to our U.S. assets currently for sale in 2019 we continue to assume a full sale of these projects in 2019 with the majority of revenue being recognized by year-end. As highlighted on our last earnings call there remains uncertainty around both timing and value, especially related to assets with offtake agreements with FCE given the circumstances surrounding the bankruptcy of PG&E. Recent developments in California have been positive and we're also pleased with the progress we've made in the sale process. However, given the continuing uncertainty in the colorful market should the market not reflect what we believe to be appropriate risk profiles and value to these assets, we would look to finance the assets and hold them on balance sheet through the period of uncertainty rather than selling our prices below what we believe to be fair value. So whilst unlikely, should this change in sales timing occur, it could result in full year EPS approximately $0.50 below the low-end of the current guidance range. And lastly, in addition as highlighted in our December 2018 guidance call, our guidance continues to not take into account any potential impact to the continued class action lawsuit filed in 2012 or any resolution of that lawsuit. With these factors in mind we're updating our 2019 guidance as follows. We are raising our net sales forecast to revised range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. This $250 million increase above our prior net sales guidance relates to both the modules and systems segments. With respect to the module segment while total expected shipments for the year are unchanged, the earlier-than-anticipated transfer of control of the modules sold results in revenue being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019 was otherwise anticipated to be recognized in the next fiscal year. With respect to the system segment, we're projecting the earlier sale of certain development assets in the U.S. and Japan driven by the opportunity to optimize exit valuations to these projects and reduce risk across the entirety of the global development portfolio. Our expected gross margin has been lowered by 150 basis points to a revised range of 18% to 19%. The reduction is used to previously to discuss higher-than-projected EPC costs incurred in Q1 as well as an increase in projected Series six ramp-related costs. The operating expense forecast has been lowered by $5 million to a revised range of $370 million to $390 million as a result of decreased plant startup expenditure now forecast to be $70 million to $80 million. Operating income and earnings per share guidance remain unchanged. Our net cash forecast has been increased by $100 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as a function of the timing of project sales and cash receipts as well as increased prepayments for third-party modules being sold to enable ITC safe harbor benefits. CapEx and module shipment guidance numbers also remain unchanged. And as discussed previously, we expect the majority of earnings to be in the second half of the year with Q2 close to breakeven and potentially in a loss position. However, the timing of project sales between quarters can have a material impact on the quarterly earnings profile. Finally, I'll summarize the key messages from our call today on slide 11. Firstly, we continue to be pleased with our bookings momentum. With year-to-date 2019 net bookings of approximately 2.3 gigawatts we continue to strengthen our contracted pipeline. Secondly, we continue to make good progress on our Series 6 capacity roadmap and remain on track for our combined Series 4 and Series 6 production target of 5.2 to 5.5 gigawatts. And lastly, we've increased our full year revenue and cash guidance and maintained our full year EPS range. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. So first, could you guys just talk about on the bookings side I think bookings were down sequentially. But was that just on the EPC side? And can you talk about pricing on the new bookings there to the extent you can how they compare with maybe the last quarter when you talked to us? Mark Widmar : Yeah. So Ben if you look at the bookings for the quarter, its 1.1 gigawatts year-to-date bookings, 2.3, right? So and again the 1.1 that we're referencing it's just from the February earnings call. So if you look at it for a two-month period we booked 1.1 gigawatts. For the first two months of the year, we booked 1.3 kind of number 1.2. So they're very comparable. And if you look at the momentum, which we'd say we carried if we carried that forward through the balance of the year, we'll be booking somewhere close to seven gigawatts. So I don't see really any slowdown in the momentum of bookings. I feel it's a robust number to start off the year. As we indicated I think at the start of year it\u2019s positioning us to exceed our targeted 1 to 1 book-to-bill ratio. So that would point us to a number six gigawatts plus trends pointing us to north of that number, which I think is a positive indicator of what's going on and continued momentum in the business. ASPs I continue to be extremely pleased with ASPs. The profile of the bookings, the 1.1 relative to what we booked in the first two months of the year. ASPs are steady. They still have a three-handle type of ASP that we've referenced before. I know there's some indications in the market of pricing being much more aggressive than that. We continue to be able to be patient, given that we're sold out through the end of 2020 and now we're effectively 50% sold for the first quarter of 2021. We can be selective; we can engage with customers, we can make decisions on where to walk away. We're not being held by volume overhang that we haven't already been committed to from a customer, so that helps us tremendously in how we're engaging the market and actually have been very pleased with the corresponding pricing that we're realizing. Operator : Your next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. First is around shipments of Series 6 modules. Can you share how many megawatts you shipped in Q1, and then what that ramp rate might be for Q2? And then secondarily some of our recent checks suggest that you may be focusing some resources on three to five-year cost-out plan and CapEx reduction plan. Is there any truth around this? Are you having people that, for example, have been otherwise focused on near-term capacity ramp-up challenges now switch over to longer-term opportunities? In other words does this highlight potentially that you've solved a lot of your near-term issues and you have an ability to focus on the longer term or medium-term set of problems or cost-outs ahead? Thank you. Mark Widmar : So from a shipment standpoint, I think we indicated that we shipped about 900 megawatts for the first quarter. You can take from that that we got two gigawatts of Series 4. Think of it as being that profile being relatively linear. So you get to a position of the shipment profile around 50/50 between the two maybe slightly more Series 4 shipments than Series 6 shipments. The ramp profile is going to increase significantly. The forecast for the year is 5.5. So we got about 4.5 gigawatts now shipped over the remainder of the year. And again that entire ramp is associated with Series 6. The Series 4 profile is going to be consistent across each of the remaining quarters of the year. Phil, I guess for the -- we are very happy we highlighted that on the call around the progress that the team has made for Series 6. And we cannot take our eye off of it though we got to continue to stay focused from both a schedule standpoint, performance standpoint and a cost standpoint. So there's -- we haven't really come up for air yet. We're starting off this quarter very well. April has been a strong month. The first day of May has in fact been a record for us with all of our plants performing extremely well we continue to have to take some amount of planned downtime, which that planned downtime will adversely impact utilization rates. But we'll -- as we currently see it going forward a lot of the major efforts that we need to take planned downtime have effectively happened now through the first four months of the year. There's still efforts that will continue, but a lot of the major lifting has been done so far at least what we currently have -- we currently anticipate. But what I will tell you is that we never relax when it comes to -- how do we think about continue to take more costs out. How do we think about CapEx. How do we think about throughput and how do we try to capture -- our current nameplate capacity of a factory is 1.2 gigawatts. We're continuing to challenge ourselves around how we do we get more throughput out of every factory. One thing that I will say in that regard while it will be relatively small, we are -- even our second factory in Perrysburg that we'll launch, we'll have some additional CapEx investments associated with it relatively nominal that will enable us to increase the throughputs from that factory once it's started up and we currently anticipated to be in 2020. We'll see the success of that effort and determine how quickly we roll out across the remaining fleet. We'll also continue to challenge ourselves around how do we again optimize throughput across every factory. And the benefit by doing that is you effectively are just -- it's variable costs. So it has not only impact utilization and throughput benefits but you're now looking at your cost per watt of that incremental throughput as being more or less favorable cost and some de minimis CapEx, not an overly significant commitment for the most part. But there's tremendous leverage in value creation for us to do that. Have there been efforts where we're continuing to evolve those? Surely, there are, but I don't want anyone to take from this that we are taking our eye off at all on both from a schedule performance and a cost standpoint. So, a lot of work in front of us as it relates to Series 6 and delivering against our commitments for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Jeff Osborne : Hey good afternoon guys. Just one clarification and then two quick questions. Mark I think you've mentioned the pricing of the 2.3 gigawatts in backlog. Is all of that have a \"three-handle\" as you said? So that includes the one gigawatt for 2021 through 2023 that you announced last quarter? Mark Widmar : Yes. We're very happy with the profile of ASPs as they go across that horizon. And yes, we're seeing very good pricing from that standpoint. I think when you look at the Q if I'm not mistaken for what truly was recognized in the -- and they'll come out tomorrow but what's truly been recognized in the first quarter calendar quarter the ASP metric I think will effectively be the same. They'll stay steady. I think it's around $0.36 something in that range right? Alex Bradley : Yes. If you do the math you'll see it stay at $0.36. And if you do the comparison to last quarter the incremental is going to show you actually booking at $0.40 per watt now as we know that's rounded for gigawatts and dollars billion. So, going to take that with things yourself but if you look at it today yes you're still going to see the backlog and module in bookings being averaged at $0.36. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I'll try to get two in here. Maybe first off just given the demand environment and the more stable pricing trends as of late across the industry. Just wondering if you can update us on your thought process around Malaysia one and converting that from Series 4 to 6. And then second question would just be around the new gross margin guidance. Just want to make sure I understand the ins and outs of that. But it implies about $50 million is coming out. Alex you talked about $35 million of EPC and then the incremental $10 million in ramp costs. So, all of the gross margin headwinds relative to the original guidance concentrated here in Q1 results or am I being too cute there? Are there more cost impacts as you move through the year? Thanks guys. Alex Bradley : Yes. I'll get the gross margin question. So, yes, you're generally right that you're seeing the impacts in Q1. It's about $35 million related to EPC business and that $10 million of ramp $5 million of which is true increase for the year and $5 million of which is you can think of a move from startup to ramp and you see a corresponding reduction in startup of $5 million. And that gets you -- that bridges you roughly from where we were to the new gross margin percent guidance. Mark Widmar : Brian as it relates to the demand environment, again, we continue to be very happy with the demand that we're seeing here in the U.S. but globally as well. We're happy with our pipeline. And one of the things we try to bring into the mix this time was not just the early and mid-stage pipeline -- or excuse me the mid to late-stage pipeline but we brought the kind of the total pipeline in and highlighted that we have about 10 gigawatts of opportunities in different phases that are for 2021 and beyond. So, very encouraged with the team and our ability to continue to engage with customers and find those opportunities. And our hit rates have been very good and I'm happy with that. As it relates to our last -- our first factory and actually [indiscernible] which is currently not committed to our capacity plan our capacity roadmap includes about 6.6 gigawatts of Series 6 which would have two factories in Malaysia two in Vietnam and two in the U.S. We haven't made a commitment yet on that last factory. There's a handful of things that will weigh into our decision-making. One of them is still momentum around Safe Harbor and how long do we run Series 4. So we could potentially even run Series 4 into Q1 of next year because as you know the safe harbor window allows for deliveries that go through April of 2020. So that could be a decision maker that will influence our timing and how we think through a conversion to the extent there's a conversion. The other one that I think is important though is just anything we do will clearly be driven by market. So, as we continue to build our backlog that will give us more confidence. The other one is I somewhat alluded to in what we're trying to do with our second factory in Ohio. One of the things we'd like to do is optimize the footprint to capture as much capacity out of the existing production that we have before we make additional conversions because the CapEx per megawatt of volume is significantly lower by just debottlenecking incremental CapEx and existing capital versus a new brownfield type of conversion and entire equipment set. And then obviously dealing with cost of ramp and everything else that goes along with that. So, there's a lot of moving pieces that will play into our mix in that regard. We'll probably have a much better sense of where we are on that last factory in Malaysia. As we exit the end of this year we'll be probably getting better indication of what our plan will be for that facility. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Jeff Osborne. Your line is open. Jeff Osborne : Yes. Thank you. I was just going to ask about the TECO challenges. How much of your backlog is in TECO? And are they placated with the resolution that you've had? Mark Widmar : So the impact of the last project that we have is like Hancock, we'll be complete here as we exit this quarter. So the items, the portfolio has been largely built now, constructed issued have been countered, obviously reflected in our first quarter. Obviously, we still have some remaining work to be done to complete the last project for Tampa Electric, but we're only a matter of month or two out before that will be completed. Jeff Osborne : Got it. And then Alex was very specific about Q1 and Q2 and cost of Series 6. Is there any change to that slide that you had multiple quarters as it relates to the second half of the year with the declines relative to the full year average? Alex Bradley : Yes. That slide generally holds so and I think there's a question around capacity as well. If you look at that that still holds so the decline in cost for the year going from 130% of the full year average down to minus 10 at the end of the year and then the production being about 75% weighted to the second half of the year in terms of module-only Series 6 sales still holds. Jeff Osborne : Excellent. That's all I had it. Appreciate you letting me ask more. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Wanted to follow-up a little bit on the backlog question and understand a little bit how it fits with the some of the safe harboring activity. To what extent are -- is some of the incremental hedging and locking in of sales just fulfillment and sort of extension of some of the initial safe harboring activities that you've already committed to in 2019? Or to what extent is this truly novel customers that aren't necessarily trying to lock in 2019 or following in on some of the 2019 safe harbor stuff they've already done? Just want to understand the composition given the pricing discussion we have. Mark Widmar : So Julien, there's a good portion of -- and what we said of the 1.1 that was booked 900 of it was in the U.S. and a couple of hundred megawatts would be for projects outside of the U.S. Potentially U.S., but most likely outside so the customer has opportunities both in U.S. and outside. They have an option to determine which projects they want to use that for. They're current -- they currently are envisioning international opportunities, but that could change as well. Given that there's not much volume, there's still some element of this that is somewhat tied to customers' view of around safe harboring. And they may already have -- in some cases the may already have volume that's on our books that enables them to safe harbor. And now they're fulfilling kind of the period in the future, which they need to complete the project. So the 5% may already be in a part of the backlog portfolio that we've already booked in prior year. And now they're saying, hey, well, I need to fill this opportunity out in 2021. And so we're engaging with the conversation for those deliveries. So the way I look at it it's indirectly related to safe harbor, because they're anchoring in with the safe harbor opportunity that's already in the backlog and now they're looking to complete that commitment with volumes that are going to be delivered in 2021. So the pricing isn't necessarily directly related. So it's not that you would say these shipments have to happen now, and therefore you're leveraging that window, which in that window if something is being shipped between now in the safe harbor window ASPs are very strong. And that's one reason why we are looking at potentially how long do we run Series 4, because I think you can get to make economic of hence that make more sense there. And -- but when you go beyond that window, it's largely wasn't the competitive dynamics or alternative options that a customer may have for modules that could be delivered in 2021. And so the window can be more competitive and is more competitive than something that's going to be delivered between now and April of next year. I think there's clear indication in the market that market is tight here in the U.S., especially through our higher efficiency, higher-performing product. There's not as much model or mono-PERC in the marketplace during that horizon, so you're seeing pretty far pricing. Unfortunately, they don't have as much supply that allows us to play that in that window. But when you go beyond that and you're delivering something in 2021 and it's -- our technology stands on its own competitive merits relative to other options our customers may have for deliveries in 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Colin Rusch : Thanks so much guys. Can you talk a little bit about how far out you're booked at this point and how much capacity you're trying to sell over the next several quarters? Mark Widmar : So we are -- what I tried to indicate a little bit is that we're 50% booked now for a targeted capacity in the first quarter of 2021. And so if you look at our capacity roadmap, it would basically tell you it's going to be Series 6 2021 capacity of around 6.6 gigawatts. You can kind of look at the profile of how much would be available in each quarter. We're about 50% booked against that. That's a great position to start the year off. If I look at it across the entire year the numbers are closer to about a third. 30% or so is actually booked at this point in time. And against that we've got -- if you look at our 10 gigawatts of opportunities 2021 both early as well as mid to late stage, we've got a lot of opportunity now that it starts filling in that window in 2021. Now clearly, we have some bookings as we mentioned on our last call that actually go out into 2023. But feel really encouraged by the opportunity set that's in front of us and continuing engagement that we're having with customers. And hopefully, as we progress the only real window, we have a little bit of tail at the end of 2020 to deal with on Series 6. But really, the bookings as we go forward to the balance of this year, and if we achieve our one to one, or greater than one to one, of course somewhere in the range of 6 or 6.5 gigawatts the remaining call it 4 gigawatts will start filling out that 2021 window. Relative to where we are right now, if we can be successful doing that not all that will sit directly in 2021, but we'll be able to fulfill a big portion of that supply requirement by the end of this year if we're successful. Operator : Our final question will come from Travis Miller with MorningStar. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Good afternoon. Thank you. A bit of a higher-level question here, when we look out you talked about some of the policy momentum that certainly we're seeing across the industry more demand from outside of policy. But if you look out kind of two to three years, what do you see in the competitive landscape? Who do you see as competitors? And do you see enough demand out there that perhaps you can fill all capacity and have pricing power in that market? Mark Widmar : The \u2013 look there's a tremendous amount of momentum. There are numerous catalysts that are driving the global opportunity for PV. The issues \u2013 the demand is going to continue to grow isn't any concern. The real question is how much supply comes to the marketplace. That's something, I can't control. If you look at LONGi now I think they're making commitments at the model wafer level, I think going up to 65 gigawatts by 2021, which I think the last numbers that I remember were something closer to 45. Yeah. So those numbers they continue to add capacity. And so it's hard to determine what's going to happen on the spot. What we do though and what our objective is we need to create technology advantage in separation to have the lowest-cost products in the marketplace, and to have the highest energy entitlement that drives to a profit pool opportunity that we are able to capture that our competitors can't. And that's what we continue to do. We've been successful doing that in the past. The challenges in front of us are probably even greater than maybe they have been historically. But that's why we made the decision to shift to Series 6, which gives us the best potential position of strength and to grow this company and to capture scale and drive through and leveraging against our fixed operating cost and manage the business from \u2013 continue to manage the business on a balanced business model of growth liquidity profitability. And that's the core tenets of what we try to do, and we're staying the course in that regard. As we look across the horizon, we feel very comfortable, but we know this will continue to be a very challenging and demanding market. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's Web site at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Adrianna Defranco from First Solar Investor Relations. Ms. Defranco, you may begin. Adrianna Defranco : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2019 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's Web site at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update; Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thanks, Adrianna. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by noting our second quarter loss of $0.18 per share. Despite this result, due largely to increased variable compensation expense associated with the company's short-term and long-term incentive plans, and increased tax expense, which Alex will address, we put a number of wins on the board during the quarter, and are maintaining our full-year earnings per share guidance. The Series 6 program remains on track with improvement across all key manufacturing metrics. Q2 saw the greatest quarterly production run in the company's history. From a bookings perspective, we recorded our largest ever individual order for Series 6 module, and from a shipment perspective we recorded record quarterly shipments. These highlights are a reflection of the team's continued excellence in a very dynamic and changing business environment. Turning to the market, catalysts driving increased PV penetration continue to point to growing global momentum and strong demand. On our last earnings call, we discussed our optimism for utility-scale solar growth driven not just by pure economics, but by the groundswell of communities making strong actionable commitments to renewable energy. The recent uptick in government commitments coupled with growth in corporate activity provide the underpinning for secure and stable growth. In many regions the solar industry has reached a cost inflection relative to coal. In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration has identified a trend of younger and larger coal plants shutting down. And a study by Energy Innovations, released in March, showed that it would be cheaper to replace 74% of U.S. coal with new wind and solar. The study further found that replacing 94 gigawatts of existing coal plants with wind and/or solar would result in a 25% reduction in energy costs. In Europe, the first-half of 2019 saw renewable energy outproduce fossil fuels for the first time. These are just some of the encouraging signs of sustainable growth we see. Shifting to the domestic market, we pointed out during our last earnings call that three states have adopted active mandates to reach 100% clean electricity standards with over a dozen or more committed to nonbinding goals. As of today, eight states enacted a 100% clean and renewable energy goals, and an additional 29 states plus Washington, D.C. are targeting nine binding energy targets. Another trend gaining traction in the U.S. relates to battery storage. Deployment of grid-connected energy storage in the U.S. are expected to hit over 700 megawatts this year, and are projected to reach 2.5 gigawatts by 2023. Moreover, the economics of these projects signal that in certain regions today clean and dispatchable energy can be made available for less than the cost of new natural gas. We also continue to see growing momentum among corporates seeking to decarbonize their electricity. 2018 saw over 13 gigawatts of corporate PPA agreements, doubling 2017 levels, with new buyers and emerging markets tipping the scale. Since our comments last quarter, companies in France and Poland signed corporate power purchase agreement for large-scale solar, making a first for these nations. We continue to solidify our position as a leading global provider of corporate solar solutions by providing clean or eco-efficient solar technology. On Tuesday this week, we just announced jointly with Microsoft, that our Sun Stream 2 solar facility will power Microsoft's new energy-efficient datacenter being built in Arizona. We are thrilled Microsoft values our Series 6 technology, especially given its lower carbon footprint and superior environmental profile compared to crystalline silicate. We look forward to providing Microsoft cleaner solar electricity. Earlier in the quarter, we announced that our Cove Mountain 2 solar power plant would support Facebook's Eagle Mountain datacenter in Utah through a PPA with Rocky Mountain Power. The project will be constructed near the 58 megawatt Cove Mountain power plant, which we announced last year will also support Facebook's operations. Continuing this trend, we announced last week that Kellogg's Australia and New Zealand signed a PPA with the Beryl Solar Farm, developed and operated by First Solar, in New South Wales. Finally, the utility scale market in the United States continues to thrive. Notably, we're seeing an increase in multiyear module sales agreements driven by our customers' need for pricing and technology certainty and our commitment to stand behind our contracts. Starting on slide four, I'll provide an update on our Series 6 production metrics. As a reminder, we began production at our first Series 6 factory in April, 2018, and over the subsequent five quarters we have continued to ramp production in the U.S., Malaysia, and Vietnam. Leveraging our control replication process, we are operating four factories which are matched in terms of key processes, and which have produced 1.9 gigawatts year-to-date. Reflecting on the significant progress we've made over relatively short period of time, we are pleased with the Series 6 in terms of scheduled performance and cost. On a fleet-wide basis, since April, we have seen significant operational improvements. When comparing performance for the month of April to July, meaningful improvement can be seen. Megawatts produced per day is up 16%. Capacity utilization has increased 12 percentage points to 94%. Adjusted for planned downtime the fleet capacity utilization was 96%. Note, in support of our module efficiency roadmap, in July, we increased the volume and engineering test articles which adversely impact the capacity utilization by one percentage point. The production yield is up two percentage points to 91%. The average watt per module has increased three watts. And finally, the percentage of modules produced with antireflective coating has increased by five percentage points to 91%. The combination of our efficiency improvement program and increased arc utilization has led to a significant improvement in the module bin distribution. In July, the arc bin distribution between 420-watt to 430-watt modules represented 87% of production. Our best factory had arc utilization of 95%, with 94% of the production volume at a 420-watt bin or higher. With 893 megawatts produced, Q2 continues our planned production ramp. And we have carried the momentum into July where we are experiencing our best ever production month, with 322 megawatts produced. On an individual plant level, all the factories are performing well. At our second factory in Vietnam, the production metrics are ahead of plan, and within six months of commencing operation consistent with the fleet average. This is a direct result of learnings from prior factory ramps, and the synergies realized by having a multi-factory site, which effectively leverages the width inventory buffers across two factories, and creates additional equipment redundancy. We would expect these similar benefits when we start up our second factory, in Ohio, where construction is continuing according to schedule. The first tools installed in June. Note, as a highlight during our Q1 earnings call, our new Ohio factory will include additional capital which, among other improvements, will target a 5% increase in the nameplate capacity. Depending on our ability to realize the target capacity increase, we will look to roll out this program across the fleet. We anticipate starting the production in early 2020, with the possibility of pre-qualified production in Q4, 2019. The progress we have made ramping our factories has been a key contributor, enabling the achievement of our Series 6 cost per watt objectives for the first-half of 2019. While this is a significant accomplishment, there is tremendous amount of work still in front of us in order to achieve our cost per watt roadmap for the full-year. As we noted in our April's earnings call, our Series 6 cost per watt is expected to drop approximately 30% from Q1 to Q4. Turning to slide five, I'll next discuss our booking activity. In total, we have 4.3 gigawatts of net bookings in 2019, including net bookings of over 2 gigawatts since the last earnings call. After accounting for shipments of 2.2 gigawatts in the first-half of the year, including record quarterly shipments of 1.4 gigawatts in the second quarter, our future expected shipments are 12.9 gigawatts. As it relates to the systems business, we converted two opportunities in Japan from our mid to late-stage pipeline and just 77 megawatts of bookings with expected deliveries through 2022. With these projects, our footprint in Japan has grown to approximately 400 megawatts. We continue to believe in the strength of our portfolio of systems opportunities in Japan and we could double our existing systems bookings there by the end of 2023. The remainder of our net bookings for the quarter were module only bookings essentially all Series 6 product, international markets represented slightly more than 100 megawatts of the bookings. As I noted previously, we are seeing an increase in multi-year module sales agreements driven by our customers need for certainty in terms of the technology they are investing in and the certainty that we will stand behind our contracts. Representative of this, we have secured our largest Series 6 agreement with a new customer to supply 1.7 gigawatts of deployment of projects across the U.S. We've also secured a 0.3 gigawatts booking with another new customer in the United States. Note this is the first phase of the project with a similar sized second phase included in our contracted pipeline and awaiting confirmation of conditions precedent to become a booking. We are particularly pleased with the strength of the bookings in the quarter despite the decision in June at the Office of the U.S. trade representative to exempt bifacial panels from Section 201 tariffs. But we are able to contract through this headwind it's important to note that the disappointing decision which in our view has the effect of undermining the administration's efforts to secure a level playing field for U.S. solar manufacturing introduces a new source of uncertainty going forward. Since the last earnings call related to certain customer and specific events, we have booked 0.3 gigawatts scheduled to be shipped in 2019 and 2020. These events included the combination of a customer's request to support their revised project development schedule and project size as well as settlement of an ongoing dispute with the customer which originated over the potential sale of one of our systems projects. Although these events had an adverse impact to our previously contracted module backlog given our robust pipeline we were able to contract the volume with other customers. More importantly we view the resolution as an investment in long-term customer relationships. Turning to slide six, we show the forecasted supply plan for the second half of 2019 through full-year 2021. As noted in the Q1 earnings call we are effectively sold out through the remainder of 2019 and full-year 2020. With the most recent bookings, 2021 is starting to book up relative to an anticipated supply plan of 6.5 gigawatts. For full-year 2021, we booked and contracted volumes subject to conditions precedent representing approximately 60% of the supply plan. This leaves approximately 2.5 gigawatts to be booked in 2021. Note, approximately half of the remaining volume is anticipated to be needed for our self development systems business, seeing our Systems business demand is level loaded by quarter in 2021, we are largely sold out for third-party module sales in the first half of 2021. We remain pleased with the bookings momentum and have increased confidence in achieving or exceeding our target one to one book to ship ratio in 2019 even as we continue to contract for deliveries over two years in advance. Slide seven provides an updated view over a mid to late-stage bookings opportunities which now totals six gigawatts DC, a decrease of 0.6 gigawatts from the prior quarter when factoring in bookings for the quarter point, 0.6 gigawatts which were included in the opportunities in the prior quarter, our mid to late-stage pipeline remains unchanged. Additionally, the pipeline includes 0.6 gigawatts of confirmed opportunities awaiting satisfaction of outstanding conditions precedence before being booked in the quarter. As a reminder, our mid to late-stage pipeline is reflective of those opportunities, we could fill would book within the next 12 months. And as a subset of a much larger pipeline of opportunities which totaled 13.3 gigawatts DC, which increased 1.6 gigawatts from last quarter. This includes 0.8 gigawatts of opportunities in 2019 and 2020 with revised demand resiliency to our near-term bookings production, while the remaining 12.5 gigawatts of demand would be for modules delivered in 2021 and beyond. In terms of geographic breakdown of a mid to late-stage pipeline, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at four gigawatts DC. Europe represents 1.5 gigawatts with the remainder in Asia-Pacific. In terms of segment mix, our mid-to-late-stage pipeline includes 1.9 gigawatts of systems opportunities across the U.S. and Japan, with the remainder being module only sales. The significant increase in systems opportunities largely attributed to U.S. opportunities associated with the ITC Safe Harbor. We have also had significant success across our energy services business with year-to-date bookings of over 1.6 gigawatts D.C. Approximately 0.5 gigawatts was associated with the sale of development assets. With the remainder 1 gigawatts was contracted with project developed by third parties. This brings our total energy services portfolio of assets under contract to nearly 13 gigawatts globally. Before turning the call of an Alex, I like to discuss recent developments related to the ongoing class action lawsuit, which was filed in 2012. As previously discussed, in August of 2018, we filed a cert petition with the U.S. Supreme Court concerning the appropriate standard to determine loss calculation. We identified various standards across several circuits and did not believe the standard used in the ninth circuit, which is the standard that will apply to this case was appropriate. We were supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Business Roundtable and other groups who filed an amicus brief with the court in support of our position. At the end of last month, the Supreme Court denied the cert petition. Well, we are disappointed with the denial. We continue to believe we have meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending this case. Also, as previous disclosed from following the results of the Supreme Court, the Arizona District Court ordered that the trial begin in January, 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2019. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before discussing the financial results of the quarter, I'd like to note that as we said in our previous earnings call, we anticipated that Q2 would be a breakeven to last quarter and our second quarter financial performance was in line with those expectations. With the sale of the barrel asset in Australia and the Cove Mountain and Muscle Shoals assets in the U.S. continued progress towards additional system sales, and an increase in third-party module sales during the quarter. We remain on track to hit our financial objectives for the year. With regards to sale of the Cove Mountain and the Muscle Shoals assets, these projects are not anticipated to begin construction until late 2019 and early 2020, respectively. However, as noted on the previous earnings call, given the opportunities to optimize valuations and reduce risk, we've sold these assets prior to notice proceed. In addition, in lieu of our traditional sales structure, whereby we would perform the EPC and recognize revenue on a percentage of completion bases over the life of the contract, we have indeed cases sold to project companies with a module sale agreement, and our customers will engage a third-party EPC provider. The structure has several advantages, including earlier cash collection, and reduction of EPC risk exposure as we continue to evaluate the extent we are offering of this service. Note in our public filings. This also has the effect of removing the sold assets from our systems pipeline table, adding approximately half a gigawatt of volume into the module backlog. With respect to the module backlog, that will be updated in our forthcoming 10-Q, although this metric is always impacted by rounding given it as reported in gigawatts and billions of dollars. This course is also atypical circumstances, which will imply a lower ASP for new bookings within the case. This is a result of two key drivers. Firstly, with regard to the aforementioned Muscle Shoals and Cove Mountain projects, the change in the sales structure results in a great upon margin, and the approximate half a gigawatt of additional module backlog with deliveries in 2020 and 2021 comes at ASPs lower than the previous average. This does not change the overall project economics for these assets that has the impact of lowering the overall average ASP and the module backlog. Secondly, as Mark noted, we had no 0.3 gigawatts of de-bookings with a certain customer since the last earnings call, which resulted in a ASP reduction associated with those volumes. Combined, these changes lower the overall average ASP in the backlog. The implied average ASP for the calendar quarter is not reflective of the pricing associated with new bookings, including the 2 gigawatts of net bookings since the prior earnings call. And to be clear, we're very pleased on our overall ASP for new bookings 2019. Turn to slide nine. I'll stop by covering the income statement highlights for the second quarter. Net sales in Q2 were $585 million, an increase of $53 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales is primarily resulted in increased module sales, as well as the closing of the sale of fully constructed Beryl project in Australia, and the sale of our Cove Mountain and Muscle Shoals project in the U.S. Although Q2 has a record shipment quarter for us, given the contractual terms associated with certain third-party module bookings, as well as shipments to our systems projects, which have not involved, we only recognize revenue on approximately one-third of those shipments. On the segment basis as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our systems revenue in Q2 was 61% compared to 63% in Q1. Gross margin was 13% in Q2 compared to breakeven in Q1. The system segment gross margin was 18% in the second quarter and the module segment gross margin was 5%. As a reminder, module segment cost of sales is comprised of all third-party module cost of sale, as well as Series 6 ramp-related costs. With Series 6 ramp-related cost $18 million in the second quarter, which combined with Q1 is put on to the majority of the forecasted ramp charges for the year. Because of the module segment, gross margin increased 18 percentage points from negative 13 in Q1 to positive five in Q2. This was due to a combination of increased shipments driven by increased Series 6 volume, lower ramp costs, and lower cost per watt. Operating expenses were at $86 million in the second quarter, an increase of $9 million compared to Q1. This is driven by increased variable compensation associated with the company's short-term and long-term incentive plans. We have an operating loss of $9 million in the second quarter, compared to an operating loss of $77 million in the prior quarter. This was the result of the increased module and systems revenue and margin referenced earlier partially offset by the increase in operating expenses. With the commodity market charge of $4 million related to the fair value of certain interest rate swap contracts for some our project assets in Japan and Australia. This is a timing impact based on movement of interest rates within the quarter, upcoming half of which was recovered during the quarter through the increased sale value of the Beryl project. We expect the remainder to be recovered in subsequent courses through increase project values recorded at the time of sale. Recorded tax expense of $12 million in the quarter compared to tax benefits of $1 million in Q1. Increase in tax expense of the quarter is attributable to the jurisdictional mix of income as well as a discreet return to provision expense of $7 million. Combination of the aforementioned items led to a second quarter loss per share of $0.18 compared to a loss per share of $0.64 in the first quarter. Next, turn to the slide 10 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information, our cash and multiple securities balance ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, the decrease of approximately $170 million from the prior quarter. Total data at the end of the second quarter was $481 million competitive $571 million that the end of Q1. The reduction of debt is primarily due to the sale of the Beryl asset in Australia and the assumption by the buyer of the project level debt. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when projects are sold. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $80 million to $1.7 billion, decrease in our net cash balance is primarily related to capital investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity. Net working capital in Q2, which includes non-current product assets and exclude cash and marketable securities decreased by $133 million versus the prior quarter. Change was primarily due to collections on receivables for systems projects, partially offset by an increase in our Series 6 module inventories. Cash flow from operations were $13 million in the second quarter. Now finally, capital expenditures were $179 million in the second quarter, compared to $149 million in the first quarter as we continue Series 6 capacity expansion. Continuing on to slide 11, I'll next discuss the updated assumptions associated with our 2019 guidance. Firstly, our guidance continues to assume a back-ended Series 6 module sale profile, as well as a significant Series 6 cost reduction with profile over the next two quarters. As Mark noted earlier, our Series 6 cost per watt is expected to drop approximately 30% from Q1 to Q4. We also continue to expect approximately 60% of our ramp-related and startup charges to have been occurred in the first-half of the year; secondly, while we continue to forecast the closing of multiple project sales, both in the U.S. and internationally in the second-half of the year. Timing between Q3 and Q4 remains uncertain and put out a material impact on the timing of revenue and earnings between the third and fourth quarters. With regards to our U.S. project sales, we continue to be pleased with the progress made in sales processes, for those assets with off-take agreements with FCE. Recent legislative developments in California have been positive, but uncertainty around timing and value remains. As indicated on the previous call, should the market not reflect what we believe to be the appropriate risk for as values for the assets we would look to refinance the assets and hold them on balance sheet for the period of uncertainty, rather than selling at a price below what we believe to be fair value. As a reminder, whilst unlikely, should this occur it could result in full-year EPS approximately below the low-end of the guidance range. Thirdly, we continue to highlight that our guidance is not reflective of potential high legal costs associated with defending the class action lawsuits, but these defense costs may exceed our insurance coverage limits. In addition, our guidance does not take into account the financial impact of any resolution of that lawsuit given the uncertainties of trial. With these facts in mind, we're updating our 2019 guidance as follows. Net sales guidance remains unchanged. Gross margin guidance has increased 50 basis points to a revised range of 18.5% to 19.5% due to higher upfront recognition of margin on the Muscle Shoals and Cove Mountain projects associated with the sale structure discussed earlier, offset by an increase in Series 6 ramp-related costs. Operating expense forecast has been lowered by $10 million to a revised range of $360 million to $380 million as a result of decreased plant startup expense, which is now forecast to be $55 million to $65 million, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense. The operating income guidance has been increased to a revised range of $290 million to $340 million as a result of the above changes. Full-year tax expense is now forecast to be approximately $70 million, up from a previous estimate of $50 million. The increase is primarily due to a shift in jurisdictional mix of income and the previously mentioned returned provision expense. And earnings per share, net cash, capital expenditures, and shipment guidance is unchanged. Finally, I'll summarize the key messages from our call, on slide 12. Firstly, we continue to be pleased with the progress on our Series 6 platform, including the significant progress of key manufacturing metrics. Secondly, our year-to-date bookings of 4.6 gigawatts continues to strengthen our future contractor position. And we're now approximately 60% contract in relation to our 2021 supply plan. And lastly, we have increased our gross margin operating income guidance and maintained our full-year EPS guidance range. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hi, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I have three. The first one is, recall the slide that you guys put out back in Q4 of '18, I think it was slide 12, where you had your average cost per watt in Q1 was 30% above that, Q2 5% above that, and then Q4 in '19 was expected to be 10% below average for the year. Can you guys just give us an update as to where things stand relative to that? I know -- pardon me; that you talked about meeting your objective and so forth, how does things stand relative to that, first? And then secondarily, as it relates to bookings, how are bookings looking into 2022, with this bifacial exemption are customers starting to look more closely at the book bifacial offerings by your peers. And then finally, can you give us an update on your view of -- your latest view on capacity expansion, and in general maybe -- capital allocation in general? So thanks for taking all these questions. Appreciate it. Mark Widmar : All right, Phil. On the cost per watt and what I did say in my prepared remarks was that we're happy with where we are right now. We met our first-half commitment on the reduction. And as you remembered, it was a pretty steep reduction from first quarter into the second quarter. So we're happy with the first-half results. Still work to be done yet to get to the second-half, a number of things. If you look at the first-half, I mean a lot of it was driven by -- utilization has come up significantly. We've driven up throughput improvements dramatically. Yields have improved significantly. They're all in the metrics that we reflected in the deck, and I referenced it in my comments. And you can clearly see the benefit of that driving down the cost per watt. As I look across what still needs to happen for the balance of the year to get to our cost per watt, it's -- there's no one silver bullet. It's one of many things. We've got labor that needs to come out when we -- through the ramp process and starting of production. We threw a lot of labor into the manufacturing process that we're now in the process of taking out, so there's a pretty significant reduction of labor that should get down the entitlement, where we expect it to be, but in the early ramp phase we threw labor into the process in order to continue to run operations at the highest throughput levels that we can. We've got some building material opportunity still that we've got to capture. We've got negotiations ongoing right now to realize that benefit. And then on top of that there's still -- we got to get the yields up. Yields are at 91%, we got to get those numbers past 95%, closer to 97%. So there's some work to be done there. We still have a little bit of room to go on utilization, so we've got to see that, and continue to drive throughput as to the highest possible optimization that we can. So there's a lot of levers, not one individual lever, but we feel confident with what we still need to do and our ability to get there, but there's a lot of heavy lifting still to go yet to get to the cost per watt for the second-half of the year. Bookings, we're very happy with bookings and where we are. And you can see from the slide that the bifacial exemption happened, I think it was either June 12th or something along that line, the bookings that we were able to secure with a couple of two key new customers, and both happened after that date. Not to say that there was an inflection point and discussions with the customer around ramifications around bifacial modules. I don't have any concern around our ability to compete with a bifacial module. It's just a discussion around where the economics land. So to me the bigger challenge we have, if the exemption stays where it is, that it ultimately compromises economics and the realization of what we can capture relative to our competition. The spirit of what was put in place under the Tier 1 was to allow companies to scale and to ramp manufacturing and to enhance overall cost competitiveness to deal with imported competitors. We made an investment, a significant investment in our factory in Ohio for that very reason, coupled with the tax reform that was provided. And what we had hoped for will duly allow our ability to ramp our new facility in an environment that wouldn't be under siege by a flood of imports. And I do think there's a risk that that could happen with the exemption as its current written, unless there's some form of a modification to it or either recession or some form of quota. I think it will create some challenges that we'll have to be able to deal with. So, yes, we're disappointed with that decision, as I said in my comments. Capacity expansion, if you look at 2021, as we highlighted in the slide there, the committed supply plan is basically about 6.5 gigawatts. If you look at it coupled with our systems business that we have -- we anticipate to have in 2021, we have about 1-1.25 kind of available capacity still in 2021. And we're focused on what we can do to potentially address that. We're very encouraged to hopefully see positive results with what we're doing in Perrysburg, as I indicated in my prepared remarks that it -- with that plant we'll go into the ground with additional capacity, about 5% to 7% incremental capacity. Which would say that at a name plate basis we could drive somewhere in the range of 60 megawatt to 80 megawatts, somewhere in that range of incremental throughput if we're successful, and what we'd like to be able to do is to then replicate that across the balance of the fleet, and continue to look for other opportunities for throughput. If you look at my prepared remarks, one of the things we highlighted was that the benefit we've seen in Vietnam is to have two factories co-located at one site, and then whether it's the leveraging of the whip [ph] buffers, whether it's the redundancy that you have around the toolset across both factories. So we know we want to leverage that across Malaysia, Vietnam, and the U.S. We've got the U.S. covered now, Vietnam is already addressed, and then we'll end the process by the end of this year we'll start the conversion of Malaysia. But then beyond that we just want to continue to drive throughput, because two things, efficiency and throughput are going to drive to our lowest cost per watt, and so we're very focused on doing that. We're continuing to evaluate options around how we can get additional capacity out of those factories. Plus, we still have the optionality if we choose to convert KLM 1-2, and so that's another 1.2 gigawatts that could be put into the mix. My first choice would be to optimize the efficiency and the throughput levers first, and then look to an expansion or I should say a conversion to KLM 1-2. A lot of different options and things and scenarios that we'll have to evaluate, but very happy with the demand and supply backlog that we currently have in the contract, and now really almost through the next 10 quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon everyone. Thank you for the time. Maybe to just pick up where you just left off, in fact, why don't we talk a little bit, if you can, on this cost per watt trajectory, not just heading into 4Q, and I appreciate what a lift that may be already. How do you think about that over time here especially as you think about the scaling the megawatts here too? I mean just -- I want to focus on the cost per watt metric and where we can go from here. And I don't want to preempt too much guidance into '20 specifically, but trajectory-wise, how much more is there to go sort of overall, especially as you see these other products continue to trajectory on cost themselves, be it bifacial or otherwise? Mark Widmar : It's hard to go forward with too much detail -- or specifics. But what we said before, even with the commitment when we first launched Series 6 and then obviously a significant cost reduction from Series 4, but that initial indication which was about a 40% reduction relative to our Series 4 cost. But that wasn't necessarily an endpoint of a destination that we still had room to run. And the two most significant levers around that are continuing to drive up our efficiency. And then if we can drive incremental throughput across each of our factories, those will have some significant impacts on the cost per watt, and enable us to continue to drive the cost down to create an advantaged position on a cost position to our competition, which is the ultimate goal that we had. Clearly it is challenging in terms of what we're seeing in the marketplace with some of our competitors and their cost. But we think the final destination still allow us to have an advantage position. There's other things we got to work through though that helps us through that destination. And one is the frame. We've talked before about the frame, and even the design of the frame is actually adding cost to the module. So we've got to optimize against the frame. And it really is an optimization across the frame and the glass, so it's a combination of glass thickness and the associated frame that the packaging, that those three components the two sheets of glass and the frame make up a very significant percentage of the overall build material. So how do we optimize against that and drive that down from where it is right now. And, yes, we've got a number of options around how to do that. And then we just need to continue to drive and improve our yields. I Would say the other one that's a little bit of a headwind right now is your yields, as I highlighted, we're at 90-91, and we need to drive that up. So it's not only driving the yields up, it's also where does scrap occur within the manufacturing process. And the more that we see the scrap loss in the backend of the factory it just drive a higher cost because the majority of the bam is already incurred at that point in time. So there's a lot of things we need to do along those lines, but I don't think there should be a view that there's not additional room still to go and continue to drive to as the lowest optimal cost point. A lot of work though to make it happen, but we got to first figure out second-half of this year, and then carry it forward from there. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: If I can just quickly ask on the incremental bookings for ASP, how firm is the market at this point? We saw some uptick in pricing for the first time in a while in the U.S. Obviously bifacial is impacting things now, but just where are we on the incremental bookings. And just if you can talk a little bit on market pricing today, as you've already alluded for bifacial? Mark Widmar : Yes, so, look, I'm real happy with the two gigawatts or so, north of 2 gigawatts on a gross basis of bookings. I mean that the ASPs that we're realizing on the incremental volumes is consistent with what we saw in the first-half. So if I look across the north of four gigawatts of bookings that we have year-to-date, that ASP is very firm and consistent really across that entire volume. And really only variation you have is what year are you shipping in, right. So some of the bookings that we had in the first quarter still were at 2020, now we're all into '21, we've got some bookings out in '22, and even some that touch into '23. So the real variation that you see right now around the ASP depends on the year which you're bookings against. But we've been pretty pleased with how firm the market has been. Alex Bradley : Yes, Julien, one thing we want to talk about that remark I want to make clear is the difference between what you're going to see in the Q when comes through tomorrow in terms of the backlog reported there, which again is rounded and shown in gigawatts and billions, so there's a lot of error that can happen in that rounding, but that's where we've actually been booking new bookings. There are a couple of atypical events that happened, as we mentioned on the call, that impacted the number you'll see in the Q, and that was this customer dispute accommodation we had and discreet events around Cove Mountain and Muscle Shoals, but relative to where we're seeing in the market now for new bookings, we're seeing booking out with 300 and we are very happy with where we're seeing those. Mark Widmar : Yes, and just -- and you got to remember too, just the natural cadence is going to be that as we ship you know, we're shipping 19 volumes and we're replacing them with 21 or later volumes, you're going to see some natural erosion of that metric. But at the same time you'll see margin expansion because the cost profile that we'll have in that horizon is going to be much more advantage relative to what we're -- what our current costs of our Series 6 production is. So you've got to look at it from both perspectives, but the metric in and of itself naturally is going to trend down over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to try to squeeze in three here as well. I guess first off in the past you've been telegraphing some bookings moderation moving through the year. We're obviously not seeing it yet. So maybe just a quick update on your thinking around bookings trajectory as you move through 2019, has that changed versus what you said before. Second on the gross margins you mentioned Cove Mountain and chose a bunch, Alex and I know that moving around in terms of buckets but was that in the module, gross margin of 5% or was it embedded in the systems gross margin and then can you quantify what that impact was. And then just last one, I squeeze in here on the 5% to maybe 7% nameplate capacity increase at Ohio. Mark can you elaborate a little bit more. Is that a debottlenecking process, what amount of CapEx is involved and then is it a quarter or two if you see success where you could then decide to roll it out to Malaysia and Vietnam? Thanks. Mark Widmar : Yes, I do the bookings in the class and I'll let Alex talk to the gross margin but yes. I've been real happy with the ability of our sales team to engage with customers and to get to an opportunity to book volumes that are sitting that far out in the horizon. But one of the things as I said in the prepared remarks is that there is a significant undertone of wanting to lock into multi-year agreements. Having certainty around the technology and ability to deliver the committed band of which they're going to rely on and then design around and the fact that we'll stand behind the contracts and there's not going to be repricing or anything else along those lines. And I think that's playing to our strength. The two large orders that we have for the first half of this year one in Q1 and the other one here and even the one that we said that there is a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 really is reflective of that. And it's really the confidence in developing those types of relationships with our partners and obviously a shared commitment and trust and having gotten in certain situations been put in difficult situations by some of our competitors at various points in times and given safe harbor and other things that are in front of us. Nobody wants to be in that type of position where they have a partner that is unable to supply them or deliver against their commitments. So I think that's playing to our strengths, so yes we have sort of given an indication of second half weighted bookings, we clearly are ahead of where we thought we would be. There's still a lot of opportunity even yet for the balance of this year. As we said we still are confident our ability get to at least a one to one booking ratio which I would say we've got another 1.2 gigawatts or so something in that range. We've got a couple of pretty significant deals that hopefully we can be able to bring across the finish line over the next few quarters. So I think we can get there but have been very pleased with what we're seeing from that standpoint. On the capacity side, it's really it's a debottlenecking, it's also it's basically there is some CapEx that you think about where your constraint is and your production process and then adding a little bit of capacity there or resiliency, redundancy and that creates incremental throughput across the remaining operations. And so there's a little bit of that. It's not a significant CapEx and if we are successful we can roll it out within a matter of a few quarters across the balance of the fleet is the only real lead time issue is just to the extent there's capital requirement is just lead time from the vendor to provide the capital. But it's relatively short time from the point of decision to actually see in the benefit of the throughput. Alex Bradley : Brian, to the question on gross margins, if you look at how we've typically structured deals historically when we had an EPC as a profit pool associated with the development of profit pool associated with the module and then piece with EPC, those are all lumped together into one large profit pool which would then be recognized on a percentage completion basis throughout the project life. What we've done here is we've sold the development projects asset and then the fully recouped on development costs and taken a development fee upfront. And remember if you look at the risk profile that we talked about at our Analyst Day year and a half ago, and that is higher margin piece of the business and that's flowing through the system segment. And then now we then have a module agreement with that project company to deliver modules in that module revenue and module flow through the module segment over time. So that's the split you're seeing here, we haven't broken out the exact Delta but that's how it's going to be recognized over time. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Can you give your visibility into Safe Harbor demand and pricing, do you expect to extend the Series 4 lines for the first quarter of 2020? Mark Widmar : We are looking at Series 4 and opportunities for that, we have gotten requests from customers around availability of Series 4, you got to remember for sure right now we're running two factories in Malaysia excuse me of Series 4. And we've heard them KLM 1-2, and KLM 3-4, 3-4 for sure is closely shutting down, we're going to ramp that up or going to get Series 6 production out of that product most likely by the end of 2020. It's matter what we do with KLM 1-2 and there's a couple of different things, there's someone here domestically in the U.S. and we've got some pull from customers right now to do few things, safe harbor as well as we have some examples which customers are actually having issues with damaged modules, hail damage in particular and asking if there's a way not for solar technology but silicon technology and asking if there's a way that we could probably help support their needs where they may actually replace some of the crystal silicon and use First Solar product. We only have a Series 4 that could actually accommodate that type of request. There's other opportunities we pull through of opportunities internationally for Series 4 in some key markets. So we're looking at that and there's some synergies that we capture think of it as the purchasing power across the glass while the actual form factor of the glasses is not the same between Series 4 and Series 6. There are some synergies along that aggregate purchasing power buying breaks and the like that we could maybe get some additional leverage only for better pricing on cost on Series 4 but potentially better cost on Series 6, so there's a lot of options that are being looked at. We'll have more information around that probably in the upcoming guidance call that we'll do by the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Colin Rusch : Thanks so much. So in last call you talked a little bit about the project business and some inefficiencies there that you were working on fixing. Could you just give us an update on what's happened there and what you're able to accomplish in the last quarter? Mark Widmar : Yes, so there is I think what we've highlighted and I think was in the last earnings calls, maybe 1-4 that we have put a new leadership team in place and we are evaluating kind of the long-term relative competitive position of our own EPC offering and trying to determine what is the right strategy and the view is very simple, if we can be best in class as it relates to our EPC execution then similar to what we feel like we're best in class in O&M, we're best in class on our module technology if we can do the same with EPC then that'll be the path that we'll pursue if we can't then we'll have to look at options. As Alex indicated in his remarks that we have structured two deals here recently that were only the sale of development assets with follow-on module sale agreement. We chose not to engage with EPC execution at this point in time just given the uncertainty and the changes that we're going through until we can get our feet back underneath us, it's hard to sort of make additional commitments. As it relates to the existing projects and the execution against the existing projects, I think the team has made some very good progress getting where we need to be on cost and schedule. We still need to go. We still need further to go in terms of our ability to meet and satisfy our customers expectations whether it's third-party EPC for example, I would say that we haven't necessarily lived up to a standard that we want to live up to in terms of customer experience and we've got to do better job from that standpoint. But look there's a lot of moving pieces that we're looking at in evaluating a number of different options and we'll look to give you more color when we have more details. Colin Rusch : Great. And just one quick follow-up, just as you look at the mid to late-stage pipeline, how many new customers are in that and how much of that is really existing customers that may try to leverage some of that potential new business into price reductions on existing contracts? Mark Widmar : I don't have the two orders that we got for this quarter, were new customers, I don't have that exact mix between, what sits in there that turns into existing customers versus new customers. I would argue, though, that there is a pretty high percentage of that pipeline that the customers that we've done business with that's largely representative of what you see in the marketplaces, you know, the next areas of the world, the ETFs of the of the world and others. I mean, they're going to be key customers. And they'll be not only in our contracts volume, but they'll be in our pipeline volume as well. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Travis Miller with MorningStar. Your line is open. Travis Miller : Good afternoon. Thank you. You answered most of my questions. But at a higher-level question, you mentioned batteries in your remarks there. And just wondering, how does that impact you guys, is this battery development is something that improves the number of megawatts you can sell or does it change pricing at all? Is it something that you might even eventually be involved in, and in terms of offering full package? Mark Widmar : Yes. So I mean, let's be clear. I mean, as it relates to the battery, it clearly enhances the overall solar value proposition. We've talked about this before, as we've moved from energy only contract to -- we refer to as flexible solar generation, which allows you to effectively provide value beyond the energy, which could include ancillary services. And we've been -- without being able to leverage that in some key markets and some opportunities. And we've done a number of studies, whether we've done a study with CAISO and NREL, we've done a study with E3 and TECO around that demonstrates kind of that flexible solar value proposition. And then, it gets into dispatchable energy. And so, that's the evolution that we see. And we do believe that you can get to a relatively high solar penetration in a number of key markets before you ultimately have to get to battery integration, but the market starting to trend that way, we do you think it sort of creates this disruptive opportunity where you can displace the deal that we want with APS and what we refer to as our some strange street project, that was an all resource. We competed solar against gas peaker and other forms of generation, and we were able to win a portion of that RFP. So I think it just, it further enhances the overall value proposition. Now as it relates to technology. I mean, the technology, as it evolves right now is dominated by lithium ion and it's really leveraged off of the scale that's being created through ED. And I see that as kind of the near-term, the most competitive solution that will be in the marketplace. So I wouldn't expect us to get into the battery side of it. Now on the power plant control side and the optimization and dispatching of the energy generation and optimizing that against the -- and for example, when we are done with APS there's a pricing tier structure that determines the energy value that's being generated and how do you optimize charging of the battery versus statute of the battery to capture and to optimize and to capture the highest value, those are the things we'd like to stay close to, we think that fits in. We'll do O&M on that plant; we already have the power plant control. So it's more or less modification of a capability we already have that further enhances the value proposition that we can provide to the customer. So that's how we see, it's an important piece it will evolve. Near-term I think you can see a quite high solar penetration before you have to get into dispatch for generation but in some markets like California; the value proposition is a little bit different and more immediate need potentially and points of time throughout the year. You'll see more battery installations there. You'll see some in the Nevada, you'll see some here in Arizona, but number of other markets are probably way too early in their evolution to really require at this point in time. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. This concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Adrianna Defranco from First Solar Investor Relations. Ms. Defranco, you may begin. Adrianna Defranco : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2019 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on the First Solar website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thanks, Adrianna. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin by noting our third quarter earnings of $0.29 per share. We had a variety of sources contributing to our Q3 EPS result. Firstly, the third quarter reflected our strongest quarter of the year with respect to third-party module sales driven primarily by a significant increase in the volume of watts sold compared to previous quarters. Secondly, on the system segment side, we successfully closed the sale of our 72-megawatt Seabrook project and are continuing the momentum with the recently signed transactions for the sale of our 150-megawatt Sun Stream, 100-megawatt Sunshine Valley and 20-megawatt Windhub projects. These deals remain subject to certain conditions precedent for closing, which we expect to be satisfied during the fourth quarter, resulting in a meaningful contribution to our full year revenue and earnings. Finally, reflective of our module's outstanding sales performance, lower-than-expected warranty return rates and other factors, the third quarter EPS result benefited from a reduction to our product warranty liability reserve. Alex will provide further detail on this later on the call. From a module production standpoint, we continue to make significant strides in the ramping of our Series 6 module capacity. As of the beginning of this week, we started the ramp of our second Perrysburg factory approximately three months ahead of schedule. This marks the fifth Series 6 factory, where we have commenced operation within a period of only 18 months. Across our manufacturing fleet, we had 4.2 gigawatts of Series 6 nameplate capacity at the end of the third quarter, increasing to 5.5 gigawatts this week with the addition of Perrysburg 2. From a booking perspective, we added an additional 1.1 gigawatts of net bookings since the last earnings call, bringing total revenue expected shipments to 12.4 gigawatts. Accordingly, we have significant visibility regarding the module business into 2021. During the quarter, we announced an evolution in our EPC delivery approach, transitioning away from an entirely EPC execution model and moving towards leveraging the engineering, procurement and construction capabilities of innovative partners in The United States. While we are proud of our history as a leader and pioneer in the global PV EPC industry, there were several drivers to this decision. Among these is leveraging the advanced capabilities of our partners whose primary or sole business focus is EPC execution, which enhances product's cost competitiveness and derisk project execution for First Solar. Moreover, our ability to execute this transition reflects an improved balance and system compatibility of our Series 6 module. In the past, one of the drivers of our EPC business was to enable the cost-effective installation of our Series 4 product with its unique form factor. Our Series 6 module, which has a larger form factor consistent with other technologies deemphasizes the need for our in-house EPC solution. As previously noted, this transition to leveraging third-party EPC services in The United States is not expected to impact any projects under construction and slated for delivery this year. Turning to Slide four. As mentioned previously, our second Perrysburg facility commenced production approximately 1 quarter ahead of schedule. And we expect it to ramp, to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020. As discussed on prior earnings call, by removing certain finishing constraints through inventory buffers and limited additional tooling, we expect to increase Perrysburg 2 nameplate capacity to 1.3 gigawatts, resulting in a total nameplate capacity in Ohio of 1.9 gigawatts. The accelerated start of manufacturing has a potential to add up to 80 megawatts of incremental output in 2019. However due to production timing and quality review, we do not expect any impact to 2019 revenue guidance associated with this change. The same process improvements will be applied across the balance of the production fleet and we expect a comparable increase in nameplate capacity once they are fully ramped in 2020. Starting on Slide five, I'll provide an update on our Series 6 production metrics. On a fleet wide basis, since the Q2 earnings call, we continue to see significant operational improvements. Comparing October month to date metrics against the month of July, megawatts produced per day is up 8%. Capacity utilization has increased 6 percentage points to 100%. The production yield is up 2 percentage points to 93%. The average watt per module has increased 4 watts, and the top production bin is 435 watts. And finally the percentage of modules produced with an antireflective coating has increased 5 percentage points to 96%. The combination of our efficiency improvement program and increased ARC utilization has led to a significant improvement in the module bin distribution. The ARC bin distribution between 420-watt to 430-watt modules is up 5 points to 92% of production. Relative to our efficiency road map, there were a couple of noteworthy accomplishments during the quarter. Firstly, following the implementation of the latest process refinements in our lead line in Ohio, we've started to produce our first 440-watt bin modules. Leveraging these refinements with upcoming process nodes, we have recently provided sample modules to drone offer who have measured and validated a 19% aperture area efficiency, which is 447 watts peak and is a new world record cad tel module. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our world-class R&D and manufacturing teams and further validates the near-term compatibility of our technology. Secondly, our continued investment to improve long-term performance of cad tel sales has resulted in a significant scientific advancement. As some of you may know, copper circuit has a critical role in the cad tel device. Through our recent R&D efforts, we have successfully replaced copper with an alternative material, which dramatically improves device performance. More importantly, the high-efficiency devices demonstrate an improved long-term degradation rate, a significant benefit to PV plant economics. While yet to transition this advancement to our commercial products, we expect the combination of improved efficiency and long-term degradation will further enhance the competitive advantage of our technology and gives us confidence in our long-term road map. At the beginning of the year, we laid out an aggressive Series 6 cost per watt reduction target for 2019 and we -- as we expected a drop in Series 6 cost per watt from Q1 to Q4 of approximately 30%. Relative to our expectations for Q3, we are pleased with the progress made and are slightly ahead of the road map laid out during the 2018 year-end earnings call which took place in February. On a fleet-wide basis, throughput is ahead, efficiency is in line and yield is slightly behind. By region, our low-cost factories are performing well. And specifically with the faster ramp of our second Vietnam factory, we are seeing a cost per watt benefit. However, our Perrysburg facility is behind expectation and facing some significant headwinds. We continue to see challenges to the build materials, including aluminum and glass as we work through our supply chain strategy to mitigate the impact of tariffs. In addition, our labor and sales freight cost remain above plan. Looking forward to Q4, we expect continued improvements in our low-cost factories which will in the year in line with our expectations. However, Perrysburg will be challenged for the reasons mentioned as well as the earlier production ramp of our second factory. Our current view is that on a fleet-wide basis, we'll exit the year approximately $0.005 higher than target we set at the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide six. I'll next discuss our bookings activity. In total, we have 5.4 gigawatts of net bookings in 2019, including net bookings over 1.1 gigawatts since the last earnings call. After accounting for shipments of 3.8 gigawatts in the first 3 quarters of the year, our expected future shipments are 12.4 gigawatts. Our net bookings since the last earnings call were almost exclusively for Series 6 product, and were approximately 85% in North America with the remainder in Europe. This includes 0.3 gigawatts previously included in our mid- to late-stage pipeline signed but not booked opportunities. Following these most recent bookings, we are sold out through the remainder of '19 and full year 2020. We are largely contracted through the first half of '21 and approximately 2/3 booked relative to the 2021 supply plan of 6.5 gigawatts. Note, this excludes anticipated future systems projects that currently recognized as bookings. We also now have collectively over 1 gigawatt booked for 2022 and beyond. The bookings included 75 megawatts for our Willow Springs project. This booking is related to our previously disclosed petition to the PG&E bankruptcy court to terminate the PPA. During the third quarter, the bankruptcy court granted the petition and we terminated the PPA, which will allow us to remarket the project to another offtaker. With year-to-date net bookings of 5.4 gigawatts, we have achieved our target of 1 :1 book-to-ship ratio in 2019, approximately two months ahead of year-end and continue to see ongoing demand through the remainder of the year. Slide seven provides an updated review of our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunity, which now total 8.1 gigawatts DC, an increase of 2.1 gigawatts from the prior quarter. And factoring the bookings for the quarter, 1 gigawatt which were included as opportunities in the prior quarter, our mid- to late-stage pipeline increased by 3.1 gigawatts. Additionally, the pipeline includes 0.3 gigawatts of confirmed opportunity awaiting satisfaction of outstanding conditions precedent before being recorded as a booking. As a reminder, our mid- to late-stage pipeline reflects those opportunities we feel could book within the next 12 months and is a subset of much larger pipeline of opportunities, which includes 15.2 gigawatts DC, which increased 1.9 gigawatts from last quarter. This includes 1.6 gigawatts of opportunities in 2020, which provides demand resiliency to our near-term production, while maintaining 13.6 gigawatts of demand would be for module deliveries in 2021 and beyond. In terms of geographical breakdown as the mid- to late-stage pipeline, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 5.8 gigawatts. Europe represents 2 gigawatts with the remainder in Asia Pacific. In terms of segment mix, our mid- to late-stage pipeline includes approximately 2 gigawatts of systems opportunities across The United States and Japan with the remainder module-only sales. Our energy systems business continues to perform strongly with an additional 1 gigawatt contracted since our previous earnings call. This brings new bookings in 2019 to 2.6 gigawatts and our total energy services portfolio under -- of asset under contract to nearly 14 gigawatts levels. Before I turn the call over to Alex, I would like to cover a few items. Firstly, I would like to note that we are pleased with The United States trade representative's decision earlier this month to withdraw its exclusion for bifacial modules from the Section 201 in port tariffs. This decision supports a level playing field for manufacturers such as First Solar that innovate, manufacture, invest and create jobs in America. Secondly, as First Solar celebrates its 20th year since its founding, we would like to take a moment to reflect on the incredible strides the company has made and the solar industry has experienced over that time. What was once produced as a niche technology has evolved into a global company with upstream and downstream capabilities. From establishing the industry's first PV module recycling program in 2005 to breaking numerous cost per watt barriers, to having our 10 gigawatts of solar assets under operation and maintenance management, to shipping over 25 gigawatts of module since our founding and today having 5.5 gigawatts of capacity of our new Series 6 module. First Solar has continued to evolve its business model to remain competitive and differentiated in a constantly evolving market. We have done all of this as a U.S. headquarter company with its manufacturing and technology roots in Perrysburg, Ohio, and our advanced research and technology capability centered in California. Among our competitive differentiators, including our technology differentiation, industry-leading balance sheet strength and a sustainability advantage, we are in a fortunate position of being sold out through the second quarter of 2021, with significant bookings visibility throughout the balance of that year. This visibility over a multi-quarter horizon has allowed us to be discerning of the opportunities that have availed themselves over the years. Finally, our competitive financial position enable First Solar to continuously evaluate the cross structure, competitiveness and risk-adjusted returns of each of our product offerings, including the module, development and O&M businesses. As discussed, we have evaluated our EPC capability and are transitioning to a third-party execution model. As a result of this transition, approximately 100 associates directly associated with our EPC capabilities will leave the company. But this evaluation has not been done in isolation. Since announcing the launch of Series 6, we have contracted over 15 gigawatts and have created a position of strength with a multiyear pipeline. However, we cannot be complacent. Whether now is the time to challenge ourself to secure the right long-term sustainable cost structure for our module manufacturing, development and O&M businesses in order to best position each for success over the next decade. We expect to conclude this very in-depth review and communicate the results at the end of the first quarter of 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our third quarter financial results and provide updated guidance for 2019. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide nine, I'll cover the income statement highlights of the third quarter. Net sales in Q3 were $547 million, a decrease of $38 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of reduced systems project sales in The United States and Australia, partially offset by the sale of the Seabrook project in the U.S. and Ohio module sale volumes. On a segment basis, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our systems revenue in Q3 was 32% compared to 61% in Q2. Gross margin was 25% in Q3 compared to 13% in Q2. The system segment gross margin was negative 5% and was negatively impacted by several factors, including low overall revenue recognized in the quarter relative to the systems segment fixed costs, a higher mix of lower margin EPC projects relative to self-development projects, and approximately $8 million of charges associated with the decision to transition to a third-party EPC execution model. Also our Seabrook asset which was acquired in late-stage development and was anticipated to have relatively low risk and low development margin compared to our earlier-stage development assets was impacted by the currently greater-than-expected variable integration cost under the PPA, which adversely affected the sale value of the project. The module segment gross margin was 40% in the third quarter, which is positively impacted by $80 million reduction in our product warranty liability reserves, partially offset by $6 million of Series 6 ramp-related costs. Reduction of product warranty liability reserves is driven by analysis of module return rates, improving module return rates for almost recent series of modules and updated information regarding our historical module warranty claims experience. The increase in module 7 gross margin was driven by increased shipments, lower ramp costs, lower cost per watt and the product warranty liability decrease. The $80 million reduction in the reserve is equivalent to 22 percentage points of module segment gross margin. Operating expenses were $97 million in the third quarter, an increase of $11 million compared to Q2. This was driven predominantly by increased start-up expense associated with our second Perrysburg factory. We have operating income of $41 million in the third quarter compared to an operating loss of $9 million in the prior quarter. This was a result of increased module sales and the product warranty liability reserve reduction, offset by reduced systems segment revenue and gross margin and increased operating expenses. We recorded a tax expense of $15 million in the third quarter compared to tax expense of $12 million in Q2. An increase in tax expense for the quarter is attributable to the higher pretax income as well as the jurisdictional mix of income. Combination of the aforementioned items that the third quarter earnings per share of $0.29 compared to a loss per share of $0.18 in the second quarter. I now turn to Slide 10 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash from multiple securities balance ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, a decrease of approximately $500 million from the prior quarter. Total debt at the end of the third quarter is $480 million, almost unchanged from $481 million at the end of Q2. And as a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the projects are sold. Our net cash position, which is cash - restricted cash and marketable securities less debt decreased by approximately $500 million to $1.2 billion. Decrease in our net cash balance primarily related to increased project asset associated with construction of unsold systems projects and capital investments in Series 6 manufacturing capacity. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $570 million of project assets under construction on the balance sheet. Net working capital in Q3, which includes non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by $241 million versus prior quarter. The change was primarily due to increased accounts receivable and reduced accounts payable. Cash flows used in operations were $318 million in the third quarter. And finally CapEx was $183 million in the third quarter compared to $179 million in the second quarter as we continued Series 6 capacity expansion. Continuing to Slide 11. I'll next discuss updates and related assumptions to our 2019 guidance. Firstly, 2019 cost associated with our decision to transition to a third-party EPC execution model and not previously in our full year guidance, including our asset write-downs and severance costs are expected to total approximately $10 million. Of this amount, $8 million was recognized in Q3 with $2 million expected to be recognized in Q4. Approximately $1 million of cash charges with the remainder non-cash and annual savings from these charges are expected to total $10 million to $15 million. Secondly, relating to the module business, there are 4 key updates. The reduction in product warranty liability reserves of $80 million recorded in the third quarter is a non-cash item and was not part of our previous year full guidance. The earlier than previously anticipated start of our second Perrysburg factory is expected to increase 2019 ramp costs by $10 million, offset by a $15 million reduction in start-up costs. Additionally, Perrysburg 2 production may provide up to an additional 80 megawatts of products in 2019, which is not expected to be sold in 2019. As it relates to our remaining Series 4 production in Malaysia, we're still evaluating the timing of the Series 4 shutdown to facilitate the conversion to Series 6 and any resulting costs. Thirdly, relating to the systems business, in the U.S., we've recently signed agreement to sell our Sunshine Valley, Sun Streams 1 and Windhub assets. Although still subject to closing conditions, we expect to close and complete the sales in the fourth quarter. Project sale values are in line with our expectations relative to our 2019 guidance with the exception of an ongoing development item related to 1 project, which negatively impacted value by approximately $40 million. In Japan, 2 weeks ago Typhoon Hagibis passed right close to our Miyagi project. We are thankful there were no injuries to personnel related to the project. However, the impact of heavy rainfall and blocked roads has so far limited our access to the site. Project is in early-stage construction with the majority of the work performed to date in civil engineering. Until we complete our site assessment, unclear what impact this event will have on project construction timing and value. In addition, in Japan, a recent proposal by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which would levy any wheeling charge on solar projects with a high feed-in-tariff rates has introduced some uncertainty in the market for equity ownership. This project, Ishikawa and indiscernible] are currently being structured to be sold together using a private fund vehicle. However, we also have the ability to sell these projects as individual assets. We continue to evaluate the sales structure and these events in order to optimize the aggregate value of the projects. Whilst the sales of these assets are all included in our 2019 guidance, we may decide on the basis of this evaluation to defer closing until next year, which will push revenue and margin recognition into 2020. In the event none of these 3 asset sales close this year, we could see full year 2019 EPS $0.50 below the guidance range with a corresponding benefit to 2020. Note that our evaluation of the preferred sale structure for our development asset is not unique to these assets. As you noted in prior earnings call this year, such as when discussing optimizing the sale of those projects within an SCE offtake in light of the Seabrook related to the PG&E bankruptcy, we will not compromise project value in order to adhere to any particular timetable. Fourthly, as a result of this uncertainty related to the timing of project sales, our ongoing evaluation of the long-term sustainable cost structure for our module manufacturing, development and O&M businesses that Mark discussed earlier, underlying down Series 4 production decided to push up the schedule for providing our 2020 guidance. Whilst we prefer to provide our year forward outlook in the fourth quarter of the year, we believe a clarity around these matters and any associated actions will allow us to provide a more informed full year 2020 outlook. We are therefore deferring guidance until the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, which is anticipated to occur in February of 2020. Lastly, as a reminder, and as previously disclosed our ongoing class action lawsuit, which was originally filed in 2012 is expected to go to trial in January of 2020. As we noted in the past given the uncertainties of trial, we continue to not be in a position to accept the likelihood of any particular outcome or to estimate a range of potentially loss if any. We continue to believe we have meritorious defenses, not vigorously defending the case. Our guidance is not take into account the financial impact of any resolution of that lawsuit given the uncertainty of the trial. With these factors in mind, we're updating our 2019 guidance as follows : Our net sales guidance remains unchanged. Our gross margin guidance has increased by 50 basis points to a revised range of 19% to 20% due to the product warranty liability reserve release, partially offset by reduced margin associated with a specific development issue related to one of our U.S. projects, cost related to the transition to a third-party EPC execution model and increased ramp costs associated with the earlier commencement of operations at our second Perrysburg factory. Operating expense forecast has been lowered by $10 million to provide us a range of $350 million to $370 million as a result of decreased plant start-up expense, is now forecasted to be $15 million lower at $40 million to $50 million, partially offset by higher SG&A and variable compensation expenses. Operating income guidance has been increased to a revised range of $320 million to $370 million as a result of the above changes. Full year tax expense now forecasted to be approximately $80 million, up from previous estimate of $70 million due to increased operating income and a shift in the jurisdictional mix of income. Earnings per share, net cash, capital expenditures and shipment guidance are unchanged. Finally, I'll summarize the key messages from our call today on Slide 12. Firstly, we continue to be pleased with the progress of our Series 6 platform, including the significant improvements across key manufacturing metrics and module efficiency. Secondly, with year-to-date bookings of 5.4 gigawatts, we met our 1 :1 book to ship target approximately two months ahead of year-end, and we continue to strengthen our contracted position. And finally, we've increased our gross margin and operating income guidance and maintained our full year revenue and EPS guidance ranges. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. The first one is around your projects. Alex, I know you gave some detail just now in terms of what to look for in the fourth quarter, but can you specifically comment on your confidence level and potentially or possibly the risks around closing on time in Q4? And also is there a Japanese project that is required for 2019? Secondly, as it relates to your shipments, I think in Q3, the implied shipments were 1.6 gigawatts. How many megawatts of that number was recognized in revenue versus megawatts shipped, but not recognized in revenue? And then also what was the mix of megawatts shipped that was recognized that was Series 6 versus Series 4? Alex Bradley : Yes, with regards to the projects in the U.S. we have 3 assets, Sunshine Valley, Sun Streams and Windhub projects, and we have signed deal to sell those assets. And that was signed after the end of the quarter, so you're not seeing that reflected in the financials of Q3. We'll expect that to close in Q4. So obviously, there is always some risk until we get to close, but we're through the commercial negotiation of getting through to final conditions precedent to closing. So high level of confidence in those assets, when it comes to the full year, the forecast has 3 projects from Japan in it, our Ishikawa asset, Miyagi asset and our Yes, it enemies your asset. As of now, the three are all structured to be sold under 1 fund structure together. The typhoon event in Japan has had an impact on one of our assets. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're just trying to get access to the site and understand the damage there. Now from the very preliminary views we have, we think the damage to the site has not been extensive, however the damage perhaps to the surrounding area and potentially the gym was still waiting to get an assessment of that. And when we look through that, obviously there is insurance on the site as well. So it's early to say, but a very early indication would seem to be that from an economic perspective will be okay. From a timing perspective, it is still unknown. So those 3 assets are all in the guidance. They all due to be sold together. If we have a delay in one of them, that could potentially delay all of them. As I mentioned in my remarks, we do have the ability to sell those assets individually as well, there could be some delta in value doing so. We have obviously structured the fund because we think that's the optimal structure and optimal value for all 3 assets. So as of now, they're in the guidance. We'll get more information over the coming weeks. And the other key is the 2 things. One, we are not going to compromise the value. So if we get to a point where we could sell those asset out and selling this year, then we would be destroying value by doing so. We won't do that. We'll keep them all together. And the second is, if there is a delay in selling the asset, it's simply a timing shift. It just pushes out from Q4 into the next quarter. So it's not a change of value, it's simply timing of revenue and margin. So that's the project piece. Now the shipments? Mark Widmar : Phil, I know one of your questions on the revenue mix. The revenue mix was on 60% was Series 6 and 40% was Series 4. And then the other question was around the shipments within the quarter, how many were recognized within the quarter? This will make sure I get your question correctly. Philip Shen : I think we calculated 1.6 gigawatts of shipments in Q3. Sometimes you guys ship, but don't necessarily recognize those megawatts in revenue. So did you recognize all 1.6? Mark Widmar : No. No, so we -- the number was -- you're close to the number around shipments. We actually have a little over 800 megawatts of the third-party module sales that have not been recognized. The deferred revenue at this point in time effectively, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. We also shipped another close to north of 100 megawatts into our own system assets. So you got a combination of about 800 megawatts that didn't get recognized for third-party module sales just based off of shipping terms and trigger for revenue recognition, then you got another 100 megawatts or so of Series 6 product that got deferred out into our systems project which will be now recognized -- a significant portion of that will be recognized associated with our Golden Eye Sun Stream -- Sunshine Valley and Windhub projects that we signed which will close in the fourth quarter. Alex Bradley : And Phil, if you're trying to work it forward from last quarter, we said last quarter we had about 1.4 gigawatts of shipments and about 1/3 of that recognized revenue, 1/3 of that was shipped to our systems assets. Didn't recognize revenue, a 1/3 went onto the module business and didn't recognize revenue. So as you carry over the module shipments in Q2 that didn't rev rec in Q2, will rev rec in Q3, however, the shipments that went to our systems assets in Q2 may likely not have done still because a lot of that will have been associated with the assets that we haven't recognized revenue on yet and completed the sale. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, guys, good afternoon.This is Julian. Just to follow up very quickly on the last question, if you don't mind. Can you clarify just which projects are included in this year's Is that the $0.50 and specifically here this has to be SCE project so this time and I closed on, just again decided to come back on just maybe as to clear about what this year versus next year? And I'll leave there. I got a follow-up. Mark Widmar : Just on the SCE project, I'll let Alex handle the balance of it. Yes, the projects that we just referenced that had now been signed, submitted CPs to close, the 3 of them, those are all with SCE as the counter-party. So we're very happy to move those forward. As you know, we talked about those throughout the other earnings calls earlier in the year. So those are moving forward. That is, again, Sun Streams, Sunshine Valley and Windhub. Those are all being -- in the process of being -- final days and signed now in the process of closing which we won't expect to happen here in the fourth quarter. The other projects that are still moving around are Japan assets, which Alex can talk about. Alex Bradley : Yes. To expand the previous answers, so Ishikawa asset, Miyagi asset and f7 enemies USA. asset. So all 3 of those are currently in the guidance forecast for the year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just the $0.50 would be for which one moving out, just to clarify this? Alex Bradley : Let's say, the comment given was around, if we do not sell those Japan assets, we could see coming in $0.50 below the low end of the range of guidance. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, just Japan. Right, excellent. And then if I can get into your -- you commented about this $0.005 improvement versus the initial 4Q guidance on S6. How does that put you with respect -- position you with respect to further cost reduction? Heading into 2020 and onwards, I mean, how do you think about that road map? Certainly good success across the board here. Can you comment more broadly if you can especially if you think about the optimization element? Mark Widmar : Yes. So again, the $0.005 actually higher than our target, right? So if you look at across the fleet, exiting the year, we'll be about $0.005 higher across the fleet. And again, putting in perspective, that was a 30% reduction from where we started the year and we are talking about a few percentage points that will be above that number from our current view. We are sitting -- we are better than where we had anticipated through 3 quarters, but we got a couple of headwinds that I mentioned in the call, mainly impacting our Ohio factories. And I think factories because when we began the year, we did not anticipate the start of Perrysburg 2. So the target that we gave you would not have had Perrysburg 2 in that number. And so Perrysburg 2 start-up and, again, underutilization and just general ramp and initial production means being lower than average, while we are now starting using ARC this week, we started it by Monday. ARC will start to be commissioned this week. We actually are getting good bins without ARC and when we include ARC, we'll see better bin, but they will be slightly lower bins in the overall distribution across the fleet. So you got a little bit of start-up, underutilization, referred to that, so bin distribution is not nearly where the fleet average is. So face a little bit of headwinds. Combine that with the tariff-related costs that we have on our U.S. manufacturing is impacting the overall fleet by about $0.005. We are in the process -- we largely have resourced our cover glass to avoid tariffs. But even there, we're seeing slightly higher cost than we would have otherwise. We're still working through our aluminum frame around resourcing of that aluminum that would bring the tariff down, so that will help drive cost out as we go into next year. But the other levers around costs will be further throughput advantages and so what we have indicated, we're already starting our Perrysburg 2 with higher nameplate capacity, almost another 100 megawatts. We'll leverage that across the existing fleet. So that incremental throughput will drive better cost per watt average. The efficiencies are already improving, our top bins right now are 435. We've just started to reach 440. So as we roll that higher efficiency higher watts across the fleet next year, we're going to see benefits from that as well. So there's a lot of positives that will help drive costs down further next year, but we do got to figure out we still have some labor inefficiencies that we are working through, sales freight in U.S. in particularly for various reasons is higher. And we got to find a way to bring that down. So there are some headwinds. But as I look across the long-term horizon and ultimate destination where it will end up, we're very confident that we'll meet the target that we set out for with Series 6. So we are dealing with some near-term headwinds and we're evaluating obviously what that potential impact, if any, will flow into next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. First one just on the gross margin, Alex. Lots of moving parts here for the module segment. Excluding the warranty item, thanks for breaking that out, the gross margin, I guess, is implied to be 18% there, but then there's some other moving parts. You mentioned the pull forward on Perrysburg 2, I think $10 million, some ramp-up costs and then some other items. So if we adjust for all of that, I'm getting to something in the low 20s sort of as a clean gross margin for the module segment. Is that fair or we maybe missing something else there? Maybe if you could walk us through some of the moving parts? Then I had a follow-up. Alex Bradley : Yes, so you're doing the right math. The product warranty release comes out of COGS out of the module segment. The roughly $40 million reduction to COGS coming out of one of the development items that comes out of the systems segment. But that's in the full year guidance. You're not seeing that in the quarter. In the quarter, you're going to see about $10 million of ramp, that's out of the module side and then about $10 million associated with the EPC. So if you work that math, you get $80 million minus $40 million minus $10 million minus $10 million getting to about $20 million down to the gross margin, that's what you see in the half point increase to the guidance. Brian Lee : Okay. Fair enough. And just on that point, there is nothing from the Q3 quarterly result that would repeat in Q4. And then just to make sure I get my following in, just on the capacity here, last December, on the update call, you talked about 5 to 5.5 gigawatts of production in 2020 as the target range, I think with Perrysburg two, four, three months, maybe some optionality to keep Series 4 online through Q1 for safe harbor. How should we be thinking about that range? It seems like it has some upside at this point and also with the debottlenecking? Mark Widmar : And just a last thing for me on the quarter sales, the severance we talked about on the EPC charges associated with -- exiting the U.S. EPC business, as $10 million, $8 million hits the quarter, you will see $2 million flow through into Q4. But outside of that, the warranty reserve release was a onetime in Q3 and the development item will hit all in Q4 as we roll through the revenue recognition on this project itself. Alex Bradley : Yes, and then it relates to capacity next year for -- Brian, I mean, we're not in a position yet to give guidance on that, but I will say that the early start of Perrysburg, in fact, if we allows us now, we -- we'll have more production out of Perrysburg 2 in 2020 than we would have otherwise. I mean I'm really happy with where we're starting off. I think the initial bin that we're seeing is coming across the production line is really good. And throughput, we expect to make meaningful progress of ramping up through -- between now and the end of the year. So our leaping off point, exiting this year and entering into next year, will allow us an opportunity to get incremental production in 2020 out of our Perrysburg 2 factory. The other items, in terms of incremental throughput, debottlenecking and other things that we can do across the fleet, that exists as well. So we highlighted that our nameplate capacity, we are right now at 5.4. That does not include the additional debottlenecking and other things that we can do across the other factories. So there's a little bit of upside there. So I would say, we were comfortable that our share will be at the high end of the range that we previously guided to for production for next year and we'll see where we can go above and beyond that. Including this one, I think we were highly motivated to start a production, not only because we were ready but obviously driving that through and ramping that factory gives us incremental capacity next year and a very strong demand opportunity set for us. And hopefully, with that incremental throughput, we'll drive better revenue for next year as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Hey, thanks, guys. Maybe going back to the Analyst Day and your margin targets. Can you just talk about where you are with hitting those targets? And then how, I guess, changing from the EPC business to module sales changes that overall model? And then maybe just a little more context what the $0.005 within your target means? You still get to that greater than 20% gross margin on Series 6? Mark Widmar : Yes, I think, I guess, the way we look at it, Ben, is -- margin is obviously a combination of 2 things. Margin is a combination of what are we able to capture in the market from an ASP and then what's the actual cost of producing the product. If you look at our bookings, 1.1 gigawatts that we highlighted, again with volumes going up, not only in '21, but in the portion that's beyond '21. The ASPs, when you look across that are all very good. They are very much in line with -- if you look at our -- on a blended basis, if you look at the queue that will come out tomorrow, I think the numbers will apply something around $0.34, somewhere in that range. And these additional bookings post the end of quarter will be consistent with that type of numbers. So when you look at that result of good ASP, when I also look at the bins we are producing, and not only that, over time, the energy advantage because some of that we wanted to highlight in the scientific improvement that we made or discovery that we made around replacing copper, that will significantly improve long-term degradation of the product. And we've always said 2 things : it's not only efficiency but energy. Whatever we do, we need to drive better energy, and that's a meaningful driver to improve energy and that drives value, accretes value back into the module and the market price that we can get. So when I look at that, I feel confident there. The cost right now across the fleet -- the fact that our low-cost regions are where they need to be, that's extremely encouraging. We just got some challenges we are dealing with in Ohio specifically. We'll address some of that with -- throughput is a great way to help dilute your fixed cost and drive your cost per watt down and highlighting that benefit in our factory, our second factory in Ohio, will help. We got some work that we need to do on the labor, and we got to find a way to get some labor cost out of Ohio. It's running higher than we had indicated. We indicated that earlier in the year we got to work through that. We're just not quite there yet. So when I look at the long-term destination of where we will be relative with -- when I look at where ASPs are and what the cost per watt profile is, we are very comfortable with the original gross margin target that we set for Series 6. Nothing has changed from that standpoint. That $0.005 is not going to move bad, and I would argue that again that $0.005 is being more than compensated by the strong ASPs that we are seeing. Alex Bradley : Ben, just to add on the EPC piece. I think we guided -- that I don't say about 1.5 years ago, nearly two years ago now to a 5%, 10% gross margin business in EPC. So that is going to come out as we don't perform in EPC. We're also at the same time as we commented taking cost structure out and we pointed to $10 million to $15 million of annual recurring savings as we exit the EPC business. So going forward, you may see a change in top line revenue as we exit the internal performance of that function. On an overall consolidated basis given the EPC was a low-percentage margin business, you should see a beneficial impact across the consolidated gross margin. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Jeff Osborne : Good afternoon, guys. I was just wondering in terms of the -- post the bifacial decision, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of the broader market discussions you're having into the closing months here of safe harboring? Is there any heightened activity? Or is it too late to safe harbor at this point? Alex Bradley : We're seeing some additional activity related to that. Part of the promise, we don't have a lot of supply, so that's been one of the challenges. And people are looking at Series 4. We still got a few opportunities potentially that we could -- been able to safe harbor around Series 4. So that could happen. But I wouldn't say that -- we were very -- even though, obviously, the exception was there for a period of time and the other thing I would like to continue on the other side is we said on the call we were very happy with USTR's decision around eliminating the exemption that was provided. We were very happy still with the ability to go through and sell-through that. I think when the announcement first came out in June of last year, shortly thereafter, we highlighted that we booked one of our largest orders ever with a single customer, which is about 1.7 gigawatts, and that was a backdrop of that exemption being provided. So we've been able to -- and we feel very confident with our capability of our technology to compete against bifacial modules. Now there could be certain applications in certain geographies that it could be less damaged in or may be disadvantaged; that can happen. But we've never been -- we understand the bifacial technology, the capability relative to our technology. We are confident with our relative competitive position. I also continue to look forward to what we're doing, not only in efficiency but all the way so we can drive energy performance out of our technology that will further enhance that competitive position against bifacial. So we -- our teams are working very hard and we are very aware of the competing technologies that are out there, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that we again have differentiated technology and advantaged technology. So -- but there will be a little bit of opportunity here, maybe like toward the year-end, but it hasn't been real mover for us because we don't have the supply available. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Strouse : Yeah, hi, This is Mark Strouse on for Paul. Most of them have actually been answered. But, Mark, I wanted to ask you a high-level question. So you mentioned the 19% efficiency in the 440-watt panels. As you continue to improve your products, should investors think of that as kind of relatively modest tweaks to Series 6 technology? Or, I guess, how much run rate do you have until a Series 7 platform would be potentially required? A - Mark Widmar So the way I would somewhat describe it is that is at core, we are a technology and manufacturing company, and we have to stay ahead of the game on the technology. So there's still plenty of runway to go on Series 6. Again, driving efficiency, improving the energy profile of the product, not only in long-term degradation, look at ways that we can improve temperature coefficient, look at ways to the extent we can to improve spectral response, right? Anything we can do to generate more energy. And in real-world conditions, this is a point I always like to make is that the efficiency that's flashed or labeled on a module is a 25 degrees C. The real-world operating parameters of the module have many other issues to deal with on with temperature, but moisture in the air and other things that can adversely impact the performance of the module. And then you have the long-term degradation impact and more that you can do to improve that over time, all enhances value of the technology. So we have many levers still to go around Series 6, but I'm not pulling to rest without thinking through. The team is doing a great job to think about use the word Series 7, whatever you want to call the next evolution of the technology where that's on top of mind for us. And we have -- one of the nice things that we have always had is we've had our advanced research team in California, that's always been out in front of the game and looking at other potential technologies and capabilities, and we've made investments over the years and early investments in 6 and made investments with monocrystalline and anti to understand that technology. We've made investments to study prospects. So we're in front of the game, and we're always looking at what can we do to take our technology to the next level. We are looking at the next-generation technology; we have to. But in the interim, we're very confident and comfortable with the product that we have and its capabilities to complete and to further enhance. Is there something more disruptive that could be out in the horizon? There may be. We'll keep working on that, and hopefully, crystallize those thoughts and communicate when we're ready. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Most of my questions have been answered too. Maybe you can just talk a little bit more about the -- where you stand regarding the -- relative to the 40% target below 2016 levels for Series 6 cost reduction, maybe more specifically around that 40% number where you stand now? Mark Widmar : What I would say, I mean, that 40% number, if I look at it at our -- let's say, our lowest-cost factory today, not only because of just the region but also because we're running 2 production lines in Vietnam. Vietnam right now because of that, and one of the things that will happen when we put our second factory in Malaysia, it will be able to leverage the tool set across both factories, which we know helps drive throughput and manage through downtime and other things that create headwinds around your cost profile. Vietnam is our advantage factory today. And when I look at where that cost is, as we exit this year relative to that 40% target, we'll be in a very good position to have achieved that number. When I look at the fleet, we're slightly behind, mainly for the reasons that I mentioned. And that's what we have to work on in terms of getting at the end of this year. It doesn't mean that the destination is going to change. There's many levers we can get to get to the destination, but at this leaping off point, we're about across the fleet about $0.005 higher than where we need to be, and we've got to figure that one out. Michael Weinstein : I mean, is this one of the -- is this the main reason why you're pushing out guidance into early next year for 2020? Alex Bradley : No. Mike, if you look at guidance, I mean, I commented in the script, right, on the module side, we've a lot of moving pieces in terms of when we shut down Series 4 and transition that over to Series 6. If you go back to early 2018, at that point, we'd have said we are planning on shutting down that Series 4 at the end of 2018. There was a surge of demand around the safe harbor especially. We had a large customer order come in that pushed us with that volume all the way out through the back end of 2019. We are actually in a position right now, where one of our customers around Series 4 is potentially in some financial distress. Now we have security against those bookings, but we're looking to optimize our risk profile that may make sense for us, one of our risk and value timing, potentially reduce some of that Series 4 earlier than planned, helps us convert earlier to Series 6 and get to a more advantaged product and technology. So there's some uncertainty for us around the module business around when we make that call. There is significant uncertainty around timing in the systems business, as I mentioned earlier, this is timing of value. But right now we've got U.S. assets that -- even since the end of the quarter, we signed a deal, although we still haven't closed that. That's a positive step, and we'd expect to close that, but those need to close. And as commented earlier, we've got significant uncertainty around what's happened in Japan. And only 2 weeks ago, we saw a typhoon go through, which is completely unforecasted and unplanned. So we've got all those moving pieces, and I think as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks as well, we're also doing a deep dive into the cost structure across the entire business. And so we've made the decision around transitioning our EPC approach to third parties. And as part of that, we're looking at the isolated cost to remain in the development business as well as looking at all the business units, including the module to make sure cost is competitive across every business unit. So with all those moving pieces, it's not the case of having 1 binary outcome. We could guide to an A or B scenario. In this case, we've got a lot of different moving pieces. It makes it very hard to give an accurate guidance. So we would rather get through all of those and come out in February with more accurate numbers. Adrianna Defranco : Yes, and along those lines, just in terms of -- and just to put it back in perspective, there's been a while -- if you looked at last 3 factories which we've commissioned, the 2 in Vietnam and then our Ohio factory, while we had a facility in Vietnam, we didn't have any associates. I think we built a brand-new facility -- a second facility in Vietnam and we built a brand-new facility in Ohio. If you go back and remember what happened when we did a wind down for Perrysburg in our first factory in Malaysia, there were reductions and there were decommissioning costs -- and reduction because you have to remember that the effectively on equivalent basis, there's about 50% less labor in the Series 6 versus Series 4, which is one reason why Series 6 is an advantaged product. Whenever the timing is of that decision to start the conversion of our second factory in Malaysia, there will be costs associated with that. Onetime upfront costs, which includes decommissioning and some impact to head count. Now if that happens this year, if the wind down plus -- as you know, there is -- with respect to kind of notice periods, we have charges. If it doesn't happen until next year, we don't have charges, right? If we run the factories through to Q1, we have more volume, right? So we're just not in a position right now, even at the Series 4 level, to have certainty because we are working through some of the issues that Alex referenced to say for certain we're going to give you guidance that we know as of now that reflects our best understanding for 2020. I don't want to do that in December and then come out in February and have to change it because of all these moving pieces. We feel the best thing to do is to wait until February where there's clarity. And we can give the best information versus having to guide to something and then revise it within a matter of couple of months. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Joseph Osha : Hey, I made it. Thank you. Just following on from that question a little bit, if I look at your slide from the end of 2018. The idea and you alluded earlier Mark to 6.5 gigawatts of capacity in, going into '21, that number would seem to be a little conservative you're suggesting that you've got 5 1.2 gigawatt plant plus Ohio that's 6.6 right there and that's before any of these efficiencies that you talked about. So, all other things being equal. I'm just wondering whether we shouldn't be thinking about sort of north of 7 gigawatts of output in 2021? Mark Widmar : The way, the way we always try to phrase it is that we are very much demand during the demand driven drives supply and in our supply capacity plan roadmap and as we get more and more comfortable and confident with the volume in 2021, but again we're about two-thirds right now. Plus, you got an corporate call it a gigawatt or so of our systems business relative to that original supply a 6.5. We're starting to get to a point to have more confidence in 2021. And I also like that we're starting to fill up some '22 and beyond. So the more, the better we do with bookings and the more we look out into '21 and beyond. It gives a higher level of confidence optimize and make sure we drive the highest pipeline, but it's always going to be aligned to the demand that we see highly predictable demand to ensure we can scale and ramp that capacity efficiently because of the customer off-take requirement for that product. But yeah, we're not in a position on this call to give revised numbers we've been measuring ourselves against is what we communicated that was a 6.5 gigawatt supply plan for up 2021 and as we learn more, we'll give you the best information we can at that point in time.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the Company issued press releases announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results, as well as guidance for 2020. A copy of the press releases and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update and Alex will discuss our financial results for the quarter and full year 2019. Following these remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy update for 2020, Alex will then discuss the 2020 financial outlook. Following their remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Most of the financial numbers reported and discussed on today's call are based on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And in the few cases, we report a non-GAAP measure, such as non-GAAP EPS we have reconciled this non-GAAP measure to the corresponding GAAP measure at the back of our presentation. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to view the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press releases and presentation for more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by addressing our loss per share results for 2019, which was a $1.09 on a GAAP basis, with earnings per share of a $1.48 on a non-GAAP basis adjusted for litigation losses. We are disappointed with the outcome, which came in below our EPS guidance range. While Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview, I want to highlight several items that had material impact on this result. Firstly, as initially disclosed on January 6, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to settle the previously disclosed action litigation, which was originally filed in 2012. Earlier this week, we disclosed that we entered into a settlement agreement that is consistent with the MOU. As part of this agreement, which is subject to court approval, we agreed to pay a total of $350 million to resolve the claims asserted by the class action. The settlement agreement does not contain any admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by First Solar. While we are confident in facts and merits of our position, we believe it was prudent to end this protracted and uncertain class action litigation process and focus on driving the business forward. As a reminder, the settlement agreement does not resolve any of the claims asserted in the opt-out action against us or the derivative action. Secondly, challenges related to our systems business over the last few months have had significant impact with respect to revenue and gross margin. These challenges relate to both project sale and completion timing, as well as higher expected cost due to adverse weather impact. Alex will provide more detail on the impact of these challenges to 2019 results. Despite the EPS result and in the year continued intense competitive pressure across PV industry, I would like to highlight some of our notable achievements in 2019. Please turn to Slide 4. Firstly, the Company celebrated its 20th anniversary and reached a significant milestone of 25 gigawatts of module shipped. We are the world's largest thin film PV module manufacturer and the largest PV module manufacturer in the western hemisphere. Secondly, we saw strong net bookings of 6.1 gigawatts as well as record shipments of 5.4 gigawatts. Thirdly, in 2019, we produced 3.7 gigawatts of Series 6 product, a 3 gigawatt increase over 2018. Our Series 6 nameplate manufacturing capacity increased to 5.5 gigawatts. Our top production bin reached 435 watts and our commercial production line, which we manufactured a new record, 447 watt cad tel module as validated by Fraunhofer. These remarkable accomplishments, which demonstrate the strength of the First Solar team and culture give us confidence in our ability to continue to realize the full potential of our competitively advantaged Series 6 platform. Turning to Slide 6. I'll provide an update on our Series 6 capacity ramps and manufacturing metrics. Over the course of 2019, we realized significant operational improvements comparing December of 2019 metrics against those of December of 2018 megawatts produced per day was up a 152%. Capacity utilization adjusted for plant downtime increased 26 percentage points to 100%, production yield was up 32 percentage points to 94%, average watts per module increased 20 watts, and our highest volume bin increased to 435 watts. Finally, the percentage of modules produced with antireflective coating increased by 24 percentage points to 96%. This momentum has continued into 2020. Comparing February 2020 month-to-date against October 2019 metrics, megawatts produced per day is up 25%, capacity utilization adjusted for downtime remained over 100% at 105%, production yield is up 2 percentage points, average module per watt led by our highest bin of 440 watts has increased 7 watts and the percentage of modules produced with anti-reflective coating has increased by 2 percentage points. This combination of our efficiency improvement program and increased ARC utilization led to a significant improvement in the module bin distribution. The ARC bin distribution from 430 watts to 440 watts during this period was up significantly to 93% of production. Turning to Slide 7, I'll next discuss our most recent bookings in the - in greater detail. Our fourth quarter net bookings of 1.4 gigawatts bring total 2019 net bookings to 6.1 gigawatts. We are off to a strong start in 2020 with 0.7 gigawatts of net bookings since the beginning of the year. Included in our new bookings since the previous earnings call are approximate 0.8 gigawatts of aggregate orders for deliveries in 2022 and 2023. Our future expected shipments of 12.4 gigawatts remained strong even after a record fourth quarter shipment, which accounted for 31% of the full year total. Our net bookings for the year included 1.7 gigawatts of debookings, including 1.2 gigawatts of the debookings in the fourth quarter. Approximately, 0.9 of the fourth quarter debookings related to a customer in financial distress. To improve our counterparty risk we have relieved this customer of their obligation and re-contracted majority of this volume. Note, demand for our Series 6 module remained strong, as reflected in our gross bookings since our last earnings call of 2.6 gigawatts. We're very pleased with our bookings performance in 2019, which exceeded our one to one target book-to-ship ratio. We believe our record of meeting pricing and delivery commitments for long-dated agreements enables us to contract significant module volume, not only in the near term, but also in 2021 and beyond. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before reviewing the financials for the quarter and full year in detail I\u2019m going to provide some context around the factors which led to the 2019 year-end results falling below our guidance ranges. Firstly, in early January, we settled our class action lawsuit for $350 million. As noted earlier, this settlement remains subject to approval of the court. Additionally, we accrued $13 million of estimated losses relating to the separate opt-out case. This represents our best estimate of the lower bound of the costs to resolve this case. These litigation losses were recorded as operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019. Secondly, with respect to our international systems business, we did not complete the sales of our Ishikawa, Miyagi and Hanamizu projects in Japan. At the time of our last earnings call, we were still evaluating the impact of the then recent Typhoon Hagibis, which passed near to our Miyagi project. We've since completed our analysis of the impact which shows limited damage to the project site itself and which is largely expected to be covered by insurance. However, the road along which the gen power line is designed to run was seriously damaged which prevented the project sale in 2019 and also impacted the restructuring and timing of the private fund vehicle, which is expected to acquire all three assets. In addition, the sale of approximately 40 megawatts of assets in India, included in our guidance for the year did not close. With respect to our U.S. systems business in Q4 we completed the sale of 150 megawatt Sun Stream's 1, 100 megawatt Sunshine Valley and 20 megawatt Windhub A projects. All three projects, which are being constructed by First Solar EPC achieved substantial completion in December of 2019. During the quarter, we also completed the sale of our 160 megawatt Little Bear portfolio. This transaction was structured as a sale of the project entities with an attached module sale agreement utilizing a third-party EPC provider. Previously used in the sale of our Cove Mountain and Muscle Shoals assets in Q2 of 2019, this structure is reflective of our recently announced transition to a third-party EPC execution model. Note that in our public filings this also has the effect of removing our Little Bear assets from our systems pipeline table adding an equivalent volume of expected future module sales. Thirdly, as it relates to our Series 4 production in Malaysia, in December we began the transition of one of our remaining two Series 4 plants to our second Series 6 factory there and incurred $6 million on shutdown costs. I anticipate discontinuing our remaining Series 4 production in the second quarter of this year. With this context in mind, I'll discuss some of the income statement highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Starting on Slide 9, net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of $853 million compared to the prior quarter. The higher net sales were primarily a result of our U.S. project sales and increased module shipments. For the full year 2019, net sales were $3.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2018. Relative to our guidance expectations net sales were lower, primarily due to the aforementioned delay in the sales of our Japan and India assets, as well as lower than forecast percentage of completion from our U.S. asset sale and timing of revenue recognition on certain module sales. As a percent of total quarterly sales, our systems revenue in the fourth quarter was 53% compared to 32% in the third quarter. For the full year 2019, 52% of net sales was from our systems business compared to 78% in 2018, as we expanded our module sale volume in 2019. Gross margin was 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 25% in the third quarter. For the full year 2019, gross margin was 18% compared to 17% in 2018. The Systems segment gross margin was 24% in the fourth quarter compared to negative 5% in the third quarter. Fourth quarter was positively impacted by the sale of our U.S. systems assets previously mentioned, offset by two principal items. Firstly, with respect to a project we're constructing in Georgia, which is among the final projects being constructed in-house by First Solar EPC, as we transition to a third-party execution model. In late December 2019 and January and February of 2020, we experienced heavy rainfall on the site, which resulted in project delays and increased costs, impacting gross margin by approximately $12 million. Secondly, based on an ongoing dispute with a customer, we recorded a reduction to revenue and gross margin of $7 million related to certain outstanding EPC project receivables. We're evaluating our legal options with respect to this matter. For the full year, this led to a Systems segment gross margin of 16% compared to 25% in 2018. The Module segment gross margin was 24% in the fourth quarter compared to 40% in the third quarter. Third quarter was positively impacted by $80 million product warranty liability reserve release equivalent to 22 percentage points of gross margin, as discussed on our third quarter earnings call in October. In the fourth quarter, module gross margin was negatively impacted by the aforementioned Series 4 shutdown costs and $13 million of ramp cost, as we continue to ramp our second Perrysburg facility. For the full year, Module segment gross margin was 20% versus negative 10% in 2018. SG&A, R&D and production start-up totaled $88 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of approximately $9 million relative to the third quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in start-up expense from $19 million in Q3 to $7 million in Q4, as our second Perrysburg facility ramped. SG&A, R&D and start-up totaled $348 million in 2019 compared to $352 million in 2018. Combined with the previously discussed litigation losses of $363 million, total operating expenses were $451 million in the fourth quarter and $711 million for the full year 2019. Operating income was negative a $118 million in the fourth quarter and negative $162 million for the full year 2019. And compared to our guidance for the year, operating income was lower than expected as a result of the previously mentioned factors. We recorded a tax benefits of $31 million in the fourth quarter, including a benefit of $91 million related to litigation losses. For the full year, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $5 million, which also included the aforementioned $91 million benefit compared to $3 million of tax expense during 2018. The tax benefit was primarily driven by the tax effect litigation losses, offset by return to provision adjustment for certain foreign jurisdictions, normalization of uncertain tax positions, a change in jurisdictional mix of income, largely due to the aforementioned project entity plus module sale agreement structure we recently employed in our U.S. project sales. Fourth quarter loss per share was $0.56 on a GAAP basis and the GAAP earnings per share of $0.29 in the prior quarter. For full year 2019, the loss per share was $1.09 on a GAAP basis, with earnings per share of $1.48 on a non-GAAP basis adjusting for litigation losses compared to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36 in 2018. In summary, relative to our guidance, our full year earnings were adversely impacted by several factors. Firstly, not closing the sale of our Japan assets impacted EPS by approximately $0.50, the possibility of which we indicated in our third quarter earnings call. Secondly, we had an approximately $0.20 impact from a combination of the delay in sale of our projects in India, delayed revenue recognition due to partially reduced percentage of completion of our U.S. systems assets under construction and the timing of revenue recognition on certain module sales. Thirdly, we had an additional aggregate $0.20 of systems business impact due to adverse weather events and the reversal of an accrual rates to a customer dispute. Fourthly, severance cost associated with the shutdown of our Series 4 facilities combined with increased variable compensation and other miscellaneous operating expenses impacted EPS by approximately $0.10 in the aggregate. And finally, increased other income from the gain on sale of certain securities associated with our end-of-life recycling obligations was offset by increased tax expense. I'll next turn to Slide 10 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, marketable cash and restricted cash balance at year end was $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $0.6 billion from the prior quarter. Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $472 million, a decrease of $9 million from the prior quarter. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the project is sold. Our net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt increased by $0.6 billion to $1.8 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. The increase in our net cash balance was driven by the sales of our U.S. project assets, module sales and greater than previously forecast advanced payments received for sales of solar modules prior to the year end 2019 step down in the U.S. investment tax credit. And note, our year end net cash balance does not reflect the impact of the accrued $350 million class action settlement, which was paid into escrow in January of 2020. Net working capital in the fourth quarter, which includes non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities and the litigation-related accrual, decreased by $0.5 billion versus the prior quarter. The change was primarily due to project development assets that were sold, advanced payments received from module sales. Cash flows from operations were $174 million in 2019, an increase of $501 million relative to 2018. As a reminder, when we sell an asset with project level debt that is assumed by the buyer, the operating cash flow associated with the sale is less than if buyer had not assumed the debt. In 2019, buyers of our projects assumed $88 million of liabilities related to these transactions. Finally, capital expenditures were $158 million in the fourth quarter compared to $183 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $669 million in 2019 compared to $740 million in 2018. Our capital expenditures were primarily attributable to our Series 6 capacity expansion. I\u2019ll now turn call back over to Mark to provide a business and strategy update. Mark Widmar : Thank you, Alex. Thank you, Alex. Turning to Slide 12, I want to start by highlighting the strong market opportunity in front of us. In the next five years alone as reflected in the graph to the left, the amount of PV capacity installed globally is expected to double. As shown on the graph on the right, PV in many markets is competitive with all major forms of fossil fuel generation. Market momentum for PV continues to build. Our Series 6 technology, product road map and market-leading research and development are all key differentiators, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in this wave of demand for clean and affordable energy. Within this context of the overall market, Slide 13 provides an updated view of our global potential bookings opportunity, which now totaled 18.1 gigawatts of opportunities. This includes 9.8 gigawatts in 2020 and 2021, with the remainder 8.3 gigawatts for deliveries in 2022 and beyond. In terms of segment mix, the pipeline of opportunities includes approximately 15.4 gigawatts of module sales, with the remaining 2.7 gigawatts representing potential systems business. In terms of geographical breakdown, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 14.8 gigawatts. Europe represents 2.4 gigawatts, with the remainder in other geographies. A subset of this opportunity set is our mid to late stage bookings opportunities of 8.2 gigawatts, which reflect those opportunities we feel could book within the next 12 months. This subset is approximately 72% module only, 70% North America base, with 43% of the deliveries anticipated in 2022 and beyond. This opportunity set combined with our contracted backlog gives us confidence as we scale our manufacturing capacity. Turning to Slide 14. With the addition of our second Perrysburg factory during the fourth quarter of 2019, we exited the year with a nameplate Series 6 manufacturing capacity of approximately 5.5 gigawatts. This includes increase in the nameplate capacity of our second factory in Perrysburg from 1.2 to 1.3 gigawatts, enabled by optimizing tool performance, identification and alleviation of bottlenecks and optimizing work-in-process across the broader Perrysburg complex. Through 2020, we will roll out similar throughput improvements across the three operating facilities in Vietnam and Malaysia, which will - with limited capital expenditures will enable these factories to end the year at higher than 1.3 gigawatt nameplate capacity, an increase of 0.3 gigawatts of aggregate capacity. In addition, we will continue factory optimization in Ohio and expect to increase nameplate capacity there by an additional 0.2 gigawatts, resulting in a fleetwide year-end 2020 nameplate capacity of 6 gigawatts. Continuing into 2021, we expect the combination of improved throughput, yield and efficiency to increase nameplate capacity at our international factories to 1.4 gigawatts. With the addition of the second Series 6 factory in Malaysia, this implies total international manufacturing capacity of 5.6 gigawatts. In Ohio, through the installation of additional tools and optimizing the two Perrysburg factories into one consolidated platform, we expect to increase nameplate capacity to 2.4 gigawatts by the end of 2021, resulted in anticipated fleetwide nameplate capacity of 8 gigawatts by the end of 2021. Turning to Slide 15. This capacity expansion will have a meaningful impact on our production capability. In 2019, we produced approximately 3.7 gigawatts of Series 6 and 2 gigawatts of Series 4. As previously discussed, we expect our remaining Series 4 capacity to be wound down in the second quarter of 2020, with total production in the year to be approximately 300 megawatts. Series 6 production is expected to increase significantly due to the start of production at Perrysburg 2 and the implementation of the aforementioned manufacturing and module efficiency improvements. In 2020, we expect approximately 5.7 gigawatts of Series 6 production. With the second Series 6 factory in Malaysia expected to start in the first quarter of 2021, and with anticipated increased nameplate capacity in Perrysburg, we expect 2021 production of 7.3 to 7.7 gigawatts. With regards to bookings, we are effectively sold out through 2020, and are approximately two-thirds sold out to the midpoint of expected supply in 2021. In addition, we have approximately 2 gigawatts sold into 2022 and beyond. Turning to Slide 16, I will now discuss our module efficiency improvement road map. On our 2017 guidance call in November of '16 and updated at Analyst Day in December of '17, we provided an expectation of near and mid-term efficiency goals. As shown by the purple dot and the yellow line on the graph, we expected to launch in 2018, a 420 to 430 watts per module and we set out a mid-term target of 460 watts per module. At the end of 2018, despite a high band of 425 watts, our average watts per module was only 411 as we faced challenges in the initial ramp of our Series 6 product. We\u2019ve continued operational improvements, increased ARC penetration and the execution of our efficiency improvement road map. By year-end 2019, our average watts per module has increased to 430 watts on a fleetwide basis, with a high den of 435 Watts. Today, our highest volume bin is 435 watts, which are consistently - and we are consistently producing 440 watt modules as mentioned previously. And we have certified a record production module of 447 watts, which requires no significant technology changes and thus represents a near-term production target. As we look forward, we see a clear line of sight to achieving the target stated at December '17 Analyst Day of 460 watts per module, as well as significant opportunity to go beyond that with a new mid term goal of 500 watts per module. Note, unlike recent increases in crystalline silicon module sizes, the watt increase will be achieved using our current module form factor. As previously discussed on the prior earnings call, the key driver to achieving this efficiency increase is our copper replacement or CuRe program. Structured in three phases, the initial Phase 1 work, combined with other ongoing R&D programs, is expected to lead to an approximately 20 watt improvement, bringing to us a 400 watt per module goal, which we expect to achieve by our -- on our lead line in the second half of 2021. After the launch of CuRe, there'll be further optimization in two additional phases that will be the main drivers behind our new 500 watt mid term target. As shown recently through our R&D efforts, replacing copper in the thin film device not only serves to increased module wattage, but also dramatically improves energy delivery. This program is expected to increase the Series 6 energy advantage by improving our temperature coefficient advantage relative to crystalline silicon modules as well as significantly reduce long term degradation in a predictable in quantifiable manner, and thereby, increase life cycle energy. Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to compare the value proposition of our new CuRe Series 6 module relative to a crystalline silicon mono PERC bifacial module. While the potential energy advantages of bifacial modules are often touted, the increased costs are often overlooked. As PPA and merchant energy prices continue to decline, the ability to increase energy output with little to no increase cost is critically important. Designing the solar power plant with bifacial modules is a trade-off of cost for energy, as it typically adds incremental capital and operating cost compared to a monofacial plant. Among others, these costs include the requirement for additional steel to enable elevated structures, additional land and development cost to accommodate increased row spacing, and increased O&M and vegetation management cost to allow for diffuse light reflection. Turning to Slide 18. I'll provide some context around our module cost per watt. As presented on our 2017 guidance call in November of 2016, over a year prior to the production of our first module Series 6 module, we forecasted a Series 6 cost per watt of approximately 40% lower than that of Series 4, while at the same time eliminating any significant form factor difference and associated cost penalty. With the start to Series 6 commercial manufacturing, we have faced challenges with regard to certain aspects of the overall cost per watt and particularly related to glass and frame cost compounded by tariff gyrations and uncertainty. Offsetting these, we have seen significant improvements in throughput and efficiency, especially in our high volume international manufacturing locations. As mentioned in our third quarter 2019 earnings call, these international facilities have consistently been producing above a 100% of nameplate, reaching a recent high of approximately 120% of original nameplate. We are on a plan to achieve our year-end cost goals for these international facilities. However, in Perrysburg, the earlier production ramp of our second factory together with the challenges related to the build materials, labor and sales freight costs created significant headwinds. With this backdrop, at Q3, we forecasted our fleetwide cost per watt to end the year approximately $0.005 higher than the internal target we set at beginning of the year, which is where our fleet cost actually ended the year. Based on our 2019 exit point and forecasted throughput yield and efficiency improvements in 2020, we are expecting to exit 2020 at our low cost, high volume manufacturing sites, having achieved the original cost per watt target that we set out in November of 2016. Throughout 2020, the module cost per watt at Perrysburg is expected to improve, as we ramp our significantly larger second facility and we drive throughput improvement across the two factories. However, we do not anticipate to fully overcome the cost challenges experienced in 2019. Across the fleet in 2020, Perrysburg representing one-third of the production will create a headwind of approximately $0.01 per watt. Looking beyond 2020, I would like to discuss five key levers that we believe will enable us to reduce cost per watt in the mid term. Relative to these levers, it is important to note the significant impact, improved efficiency and throughput have on cost per watt. Firstly, efficiency improvements generally have little, if any impact on the cost of producing a module. Therefore, in general, the percentage improvement in watt per module can be directly translated into a reduction in cost per watt. Secondly, throughput improvement, essentially by definition, are leveraged against fixed cost, which results in the incremental volume above nameplate capacity being the variable cost of production or typically the module build materials. Now looking at the slide and starting on the left, the blue bar represents the original cost per watt target communicated in November of 2016, which we anticipate achieving at our high volume international manufacturing site by the end of 2020. Beginning with watts per module, increased module wattage through our previously discussed R&D efforts and the CuRe program leads to a significant cost per watt reduction. Secondly, over the mid term, we see the potential to increase throughput by approximately 30% to 35%, which provides a fixed cost dilution benefit. Thirdly, we are targeting an increase in manufacturing yield from approximately 95% today to a mid-term run rate of approximately 98%, which provides a direct benefit to fixed and variable cost. Fourthly, we see mid-term opportunities to reduce variable build material cost of between 20% and 30%, primarily across glass and aluminum. And finally, we believe the combination of increased watts per module and transport optimization can lead to a 10% to 20% reduction in sales freight cost. Note, for comparison purposes please remember, unlike our competitors we include sales freight and warranty in our cost per watt. Combined with the benefits of our CuRe and other R&D work with the aforementioned cost levers, we believe we are strongly positioned to continue to drive Series 6 cost per watt efficiency and energy improvements over the mid -- the near and mid-term. Relative to our commitment to technology leadership, as I mentioned previously, we have recently re-energized our advanced research team. While there is still tremendous headroom in our Series 6 platform, we continue to challenge ourselves on commercializing the next generation disruptive thin-film technology. It is exciting to see what the team has accomplished so far and the extraordinary potential there is for thin-film, cad-tel, PV beyond Series 6. Finally, before turning the call over to Alex, I would like to provide an update on the internal review discussed on the third quarter earnings call. As a reflect over to less than two years since our first Series 6 production module came off our initial line of Perrysburg we are extremely pleased with the progress we've made. We've created a position of strength with our multi-year backlog and our module wattage energy in cost per Watt roadmaps. However, as we look across the next decade, we need to challenge our business vertical strategy to assess if product offerings - if our product offerings are at a position of strength that can leverage point of differentiation to create value for our customers and an attractive profit pool. We have been conducting an evaluation of the long term sustainable cost structure, competitiveness and risk adjusted returns of the each of our product offerings including the module, development and O&M business. At our core, we are a technology and manufacturing company. Over time, we have added to this core competency in order to address unmet needs within the market, optimizing around and enabling a delivery of our products and capturing an incremental profit pool. These capabilities have included, among others, project development, EPC and O&M. As discussed in our previous earnings call, we have made a decision to transition to a third-party EPC execution model. We originally entered into the EPC business to enable cost effective installation of our smaller form factor modules and to fill a credit - the capability gap in the PV market. Over time, market participants increased with many having economies of scale, leveraged across multiple market segments, the external ecosystem of the EPC capabilities improved and risk-adjusted returns diminished at the same time as our product evolved to be more compatible with market balance of system offerings. Consequently, the premise for us maintaining an internal EPC competency was no longer justified and hence, we made the decision to transition to a third-party EPC execution model. The U.S. development business was likewise experience of significant evolution and the business that we entered into in 2008 is dramatically different today. Originally viewed as a channel to market for our smaller form factor modules, the development business initially saw PPA size in the hundreds of megawatts in a handful of markets providing certainty of offtake for a significant portion of our manufacturing capacity. We also benefited from our first-mover advantage, enabling us to capture a profit pool incremental to our module sales. Today, we are significantly expanding our manufacturing capacity with a more advantaged Series 6 product, competition within the development market has increased, project sizes have decreased and the risk-adjusted returns have reduced, as aggressive pricing has resulted in benefits to -- of the projects flowing to declining LCOEs rather than to increase development margins. At the same time the capabilities required to be successful and then development have changed. The historic pillars of solar project development include siting, permitting, interconnection and securing a creditworthy PPA. These skills remain fundamental, however, successful project development at a meaningful scale today requires a broader geographical market presence, as well as additional competencies such as battery storage, power trading, the ability to manage increased offtake complexity and financial structure and complexity, as well as asset ownership. In this more competitive environment, there remain opportunities for project developers to make sensible margins. However, for us to remain competitive in the long term we would need to invest in enhancing our capabilities and offerings to the market to reflect this new development paradigm, while maintaining a competitive cost structure. Any such investment needs to be compared with our primary investment thesis to increased module R&D and add manufacturing capacity and improvements. Accordingly, our focus is not to create internal capabilities that already exist externally. As a result, we are working with an advisor to evaluate strategic options to best position our U.S. development business with the mandate to position the business to succeed and the continuing evolving market for solar generation assets, while maximizing value for First Solar shareholders. While we're are open to partnering with a third-party who possesses complementary competencies and capital to further scale the business, the pursuit of a partnership could potentially result in a complete sale of the U.S. development business. Turning to O&M. We entered the business at the same time as we entered into utility scale development and EPC in order to satisfy another unmet need in the PV market and take advantage of another profit pool within the utility-scale space. Our O&M business on the natural extension of our position, as one of the largest developers and EPC contractors in the PV industry allowing us to maintain a long term relationship with the counterparty and the project after was developed, sold and constructed by us. Over the last several years, we have expanded our O&M business beyond our captive development pipeline to third-party developed projects with and without our modules. We have created a formidable [ph] position, as the largest O&M provider in the U.S. Our economies of scale, largely have traded a competitive advantage and allowed us to maintain a profit pool in an aggressive pricing environment. However, beyond scale additional value-added services and cycles of innovation are needed to enhance our O&M value proposition and deliver services in a more cost-effective manner. We continue to evaluate our O&M strategy in light of these requirements. For clarity through our ongoing evaluation the objective is to ensure our O&M business able without constraints to achieve its full enterprise value potential and continued market leadership. The consideration of strategic options for our U.S. development business is at preliminary stage and may not result in any transaction being consummated. We do not intend to disclose further developments with respect to this evaluation process, except to the extent, the process is concluded or is otherwise deemed appropriate. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Alex, who'll provide 2020 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Turning to Slide 21. I'll begin by discussing the assumptions included in our 2020 guidance. Given the uncertainty around any outcome from the evaluation of strategic options for our development business our 2020 guidance assumes no change to existing lines of business. Starting with production, our Series 6 volume is expected to increase to 5.7 gigawatts with an additional 300 megawatts of Series 4 prior to shutting down our remaining Series 4 capacity in the second quarter. As a result of this transition, we expect to incur approximately $20 million of severance decommissioning and other shutdown costs in 2020. 2020 volume sold was expected to be 5.7 to 5.9 gigawatts. As a reminder in 2019, we structured our Cove Mountain and Muscle Shoals and Little Bear projects as sale of their project entity with an upfront development fees and then associated module supply agreements. In 2020, we expect to continue to structure U.S. assets under - sales under a similar structure, including the sale of our American Kings and Sun Streams 2 assets. Optimize for our new approach to EPC execution the structure will have the effect of moving approximately 900 megawatts of sales from our System segment to the Module segment. The mix of 2020 net sales is anticipated to be approximately 70% module and 30% systems. Included in the systems net sales in the United States is the residual revenue recognition associated with the GA Solar 4, Sun Streams 1, Sunshine Valley, Seabrook and Windhub A projects. Additionally, our guidance includes the sale of our Ishikawa and Hanamizu assets in Japan, which may be sold together or individually. Due to the uncertainty relating to the cost and timing of the construction of the Gen 5, we had excluded Miyagi from our 2020 guidance. Our ongoing Series 6 capacity expansion is expected to impact 2020 operating income by $55 million to $75 million, this will comprise $50 million to $60 million of start-up expense incurred by our second Malaysian factory and $5 million to $15 million of ramp costs associated with our second Perrysburg factory. We anticipate our second Perrysburg factory will exit the ramp period by the end of the first quarter of 2020. While we're not providing specific guidance around the Series 6 module cost-per-watt for 2020, we do anticipate continuous improvement over the course of the year. Despite an increase in the proportion of module volume coming from our higher cost Perrysburg facility in 2019 relative to where we ended - sorry, in 2020 relative to where we ended 2019. We expect our fleetwide cost-per-watt to decline approximately 10% over the year. A brief word on the coronavirus outbreak. While we have a geographically diverse supply chain it does include partners in China that supply us raw materials of our commodities. To-date, we managed the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and do not had any material impact on our operations. Our guidance accordingly assumes, we will continue to be able to mitigate any such impacts on our supply chain and operations without the incur in the material cost. Finally, in addition to the previously mentioned Series 4 related shutdown costs, as part of the strategic review and cost structure analysis that Mark discussed earlier, we've recently effected the reduction in force. Although we expect this to lead to $25 million to $35 million of long-term run rate savings in 2020, we expect to see severance related impacts of approximately $10 million from these actions. I\u2019ll now cover the 2020 guidance ranges on Slide 21. Our net sales guidance is between $2.7 million and $2.9 billion. Gross margin is projected to be between 26% and 27%, which includes $5 million to $15 million of ramp costs. Operating expenses are expected to be between $340 million and $360 million, which includes $50 million to $60 million of production start-up expenses primarily for our second Malaysia factory. We anticipate core R&D and SG&A cost, excluding start-up of $290 million to $300 million. Operating income is expected to be between $360 million and $420 million, that was inclusive of between $55 million and $75 million of combined ramp costs and plant start-up expenses, $20 million Series 4 shutdown costs and $10 million of severance costs. Turning to non-operating items, we expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to zero. Full year tax expense is forecast to $15 million to $25 million, which includes the benefit of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter associated with the closing of the statute limitations on uncertain tax positions and we expect no contribution from equity in earnings. This results in full year 2020 earnings per share guidance range of $3.25 to $3.75. Earnings are expected to be back-end weighting with approximately 20% in the first half of the year and 80% in the second-half, as a result of several factors. Firstly although ASPs are expected to remain relatively flat, cost-per-watt is expected to decrease throughout the year. Secondly, we expect to recognize revenue on lower margin systems business, including our remaining U.S. EPC projects as one of our India asset sales in the first-half of the year. Conversely, our Japan assets were expected to be sold in the second-half of the year. Thirdly Series 6 ramp and start-up costs Series 4 shutdown costs and severance charges are all weighted towards the first-half of the year. Capital expenditures in 2020 are expected to range from $450 million to $550 million as we convert one of our remaining two Series 4 factories in Malaysia into our six Series 6 factory invested in expanding capacity on existing Series 6 facilities and begin the implementation of our CuRe program. Our year-end 2020 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. The decrease from our 2019 year-end net cash balance is primarily due to payment of the $350 million class action lawsuit settlement, capital expenditures and deliveries against module Safe Harbor prepayments in 2019, offset by cash flows from module and project sales. And finally, we expect module shipments of 5.8 gigawatts to 6 gigawatts in 2020. Turning to Slide 22, I\u2019ll summarize the key messages from today's call. We continue to make significant progress on our Series 6 transition, both from a demand and supply perspective. On the demand side, we ended 2019 with net bookings of 6.1 gigawatts and the current contracted backlog of 12.4 gigawatts. Our opportunity pipeline continues to grow going into 2020 with the global opportunity set of 18.1 gigawatts including mid-to-late stage opportunities 8.2 gigawatts. On the supply side, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to increase our nameplate Series 6 manufacturing capacity to 6 gigawatts by year-end 2020 and 8 gigawatts by year-end 2021. In 2020, we expect to produce 5.7 gigawatts of Series 6 volume, the year-over-year increase of over 50%. And we see significant mid-term opportunity for improvements to our module efficiency, cost and energy metrics. Despite a challenging end to 2019, we recorded non-GAAP EPS of $1.48 and are forecasting full-year 2020 earnings per share of $3.25 to $3.75. And finally, following a review of our cost structure, risk-adjusted returns and strategic value, we are exploring strategic options for our U.S. development business. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Shen with Roth Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. The first one is on your definition of mid-term. Was wondering, if you could provide a little bit more detail on that. Mark, I think you mentioned that the lead line with copper replacement technology would be starting in back half of '21. So is that kind of mid term target, a back half '21 or early '22 type time frame? And then, as it relates to the systems business, was wondering, if you could walk us through kind of how we should be modeling going forward? Historically, you guys have talked about a gigawatt of system sales per year. I think that's probably what's baked in everybody's model. Should we start to feather that back or just remove that completely? Any thoughts on that would be great. Thanks, Mark. Mark Widmar : Yes. So on the mid term. So if you think about the CuRe program, we'll start the initial production, our lead line in the second half of 2021 and then start to see it really realized across the entire fleet in 2022. So if you think about even that, let's say the 2022, we originally have sort of set the mid term goal in '17 or so. So it also gives you some indication of a horizon, which we may be looking towards for the 500 watt module that we dedicated as well. But we're very obviously pleased with the launch of our copper replacement program and we're also - to couple that with where our backlog position is right now, it really hits the window where we wanted to hit, is the window we need to sell through into in '22 and '23. You should look to the majority of that volume in that window. We'll be able to have our copper replacement program out there and competitively pricing into the marketplace and capturing the full value of the energy yield that we would realize from that. The systems business, Alex can give you some insight around modules, but what I want to make sure is clear as well is we have committed to a safe harbor investment and we've talked about that. We've got the capability of safe jarboring couple of gigawatts. We have a mid to late stage pipeline of close to 2 gigawatts here in the U.S. of opportunities that we're actively engaging in. We have purposely looked to try to monetize those projects into a 2022, 2023 window. It also somewhat ties in nicely to where the 201 tariffs start to wind down plus your value of your safe harbor investment is most accretive in '22 and '23. So you'll see as we continue to build up that pipeline and monetizing contract, most of the volumes are going to be out in '22 and '23. I think, the best way to think about it right now, Phil, is not to assume any changes, because we're going down too fast. One is, look, I think, when you position us into utility-owned generation space, which we're seeing a lot of that happening in the market right now and a pretty significant inflection point of that happening and a big portion of our 2 gigawatt, that's a sweet spot for us and we'll hit home runs there all day long is exactly where we want to be, because we don't want to generating assets, when we work with great counterparty. The problem we have a little bit of where I want to see how we can further enhance our capabilities is more complex transactions, merchant risk exposure, hedge contracts, basis risk basically block power shared storage, that's a space that we I don't think yet are where we need to be relative to the capabilities of the marketplace. And so we need to challenge ourself in how do we best accomplish that and one of the path to do is that is can we find a partner or somebody else we can work with that has those types of capabilities that are complementary to where we are. But we also highlighted to the extent we go down that path, it could result in a sale of the business through a partnership structure that someone may obviously we'll look to deal within the best interest of our shareholders. But if it resulted in someone paying maximum value for the platform that we have, we may look to that as the best possible outcome if we feel we're uncomfortable with getting kind of the partnership capabilities that we think we would need to best compete over the next decade. And as you may remember, this is the objective we set out for is how do we position, not only our module business, but our energy services business and our development business to be able to thrive in the upcoming decade. And we need to make sure there is a path to do that and that's what we're exploring right now. Alex Bradley : Yeah. So the only thing I\u2019ll add to that is on the near term, so in the guidance, we said about 70% of the revenue line is going to be on the module, about 30% on the systems, that reflects only a pretty small portion. So there's only somewhere around 300 to 400 megawatts going through that line. However, as I mentioned in the remarks, I want to make sure it\u2019s clear, in the last year or so, we've been structuring deals differently as we've been looking at our EPC capabilities and looking to exit our internal EPC and going to the third-party model. And so what we've done is we've changed how we sell projects to selling a project SPV or entity and then enter into a module sale agreement. And if you look at all the deals we've done with over the last year, the impact that means there is about 900 megawatts of volume that is going to go through the Module segment this year, that had it not been for that new change in structure, would have gone through the Systems segment. So we've historically guided to somewhere around 1 gigawatt a year of volume. If you look at this year, you're going to be somewhere around 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 gigawatts of volume generated by the systems business, all right? That volume was originated through the systems channel, although you're not going to see it flow through the Systems segment this year based on those deal structures. But I think in the long term, for modeling purposes, stick to that roughly 1 gigawatt a year of systems business that we've guided to, absent any changes that we guided to later in the year, pending the outcome of our discussions in the market around the systems business. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two here. First, if I look at the module gross margin for Q4 here exiting 2019% at 24%, you assume flattish ASPs, which I think you mentioned on the call and a 10% cost decline for 2020. It seems to imply gross margins for modules in 2020 will be high 20% or so, 28% let's say. First, is that the right read here? And I guess, that's also assuming no mix shift impact from Series 6 either, given 2020 will be almost all Series 6 and you still had a meaningful amount of Series 4 in Q4, but will be curious if you could provide some color around the module margins this year? And then just secondly, on the strategic review for the systems business, just trying to understand the thought process here, what is -- is taking a partner potentially if that's an option or outcome of this review? Does that lower the OpEx? Can you give us some sense of how much of your OpEx is tied to that segment versus modules? And then, if you just end up divesting this segment in one transaction, what would be the motivation of that versus simply slowing down the systems over the course of the next few years implied in the pipeline COD dates? Thanks. Alex Bradley : Yeah, Brian. I'll give you a little bit of color on the gross margin. So we haven't broken out by module and system, but you can see in the guidance, we are guiding to a 26% to 27% on a consolidated basis. You're right that there is limited reduction on the ASP side as we go from '19 into '20, although we are seeing some - we are seeing a cost per watt drag largely associated with Perrysburg. So we talked about ending the year about $0.005 [ph] higher than our expectations on a fleetwide basis, largely driven by cost per watt at Perrysburg. If you think about the mix shift, although we get some benefit from moving Series 4 to Series 6, as we ramp Perrysburg 2 this year on a mix basis, we're going to have more relative volume coming from our higher cost factories than we did last year. So that drag now across the fleet is going to be around $0.01 cost per watt in 2020. On the system side, we've got lower volume, hence you're seeing lower revenue on the - in revenue line, but on the margin side, there is three other things I'd point to that are dragging down consolidated gross margin through the year. You've got start-up and ramp costs, which is coming in and about $60 million to $79 million coming through, and that's associated with bringing Perrysburg 2 up and Malaysia 2. So you've got a pretty significant track there. We've also got about $20 million of shutdown cost associated with closing the Series 4 factory in Malaysia and you're going to see that coming through the gross margin line as well. And then, finally, about $10 million of severance cost. So as you look through the gross margin line this year, just bear in mind, you've got somewhere close to $100 million relative to that 2.8-ish [ph] point of revenue line that's impacting gross margin on a negative basis. Mark Widmar : Yea, but I think when you normalize for those items that are impacting the Module segment, Brian, I mean, you're going to get to a number that's in the range that you referenced from that standpoint. The systems business, first off, as we think about - the way I look at this is that there is the market need and then there is internal capabilities. And we have to understand, given the market needs, how do we best address that and then what's the most efficient way and OpEx way of doing that. And to sort of replicate or to invest in certain capabilities, let's say the power trading capability as an example, right. I don't know, if we want to step into that space. And so to me, a partnership can bring a lot of value to us in the fact that we can create a complementary offer. We've got a great development team with great development sites, interconnection positions and capability with safe harbor that we made the investment in. The real question is, how do you monetize that and capture the optimal value with it. And for me, it's rather instead of internally create something that maybe is externally already in the marketplace and is already performing well, it makes more sense from my standpoint to say how do we engage with those types of partners and then create a synergistic impact versus trying to invest heavily and create maybe not as strong market capability we would with - otherwise with the partnership. So that's kind of the motivation. As it relates to the OpEx, look, there is a meaningful mark - a portion of OpEx that - it not only resonates with just the direct, let's say, the customer-facing team from development, but it's my project finance team, it's the legal structuring cost around these deals, it's the complexity around the accounting, it drives tremendous tax-related activities and separation of new entities and setting them up and manage through that. So there is a pretty significant OpEx impact. I mean, if you look at our K, we disclose that - we have about 500 heads across the Company -- north of 6,000 that are related to our systems business. Now that also includes our energy services business, but - which is a good portion of that total. But you can tell that there is a pretty significant headcount resource intensity associated with our systems business that we've got to make sure that - and again, on some segments of the market and solutions that are required and I'll use EOG as a great example, I think, we do very well there, and we'll continue to excel there. But no different than our module business or no different than our energy services business, which I indicated, we've created tremendous amount of scale advantage and being a market leader. And when I look at our development business, I have to be comfortable that we can create scale there as well, because infrastructure-related cost is going to be there. And you've seen it happen over the years, because the cost to develop and the resources to develop a 500 megawatt project like we did in the early days is really no different than to develop a 75 or a 100 megawatt project, right? So project sizes have come down, and therefore, you are actually losing the leverage of scale. And so those are the things that we're looking at and we're trying to figure out what's the right path forward or to enable what we think is a great platform. We're not the diminishing the platform at all, but as we think through, how do we make sure we can thrive and excel through this upcoming decade, there are certain capabilities we think partnering with someone else could bring to us that would further enhance the value proposition of our development business. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Paul Coster : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like something in the region of $1 of the shortfall in the fourth quarter was attributable to Japan, India, et cetera. How much of that $1 approximately carries over into 2020? Alex Bradley : Yeah, Paul. So if I look at... Paul Coster : The Japan business, sorry. Alex Bradley : Yeah. So if I look at it, you've got about $1 shortfall, about $0.70 of that is related to timing. So you've got Japan, India, U.S. projects and U.S. module. But there's also another, call it, roughly $30 million of true cost increases. So impacts from U.S. project, weather issues. We had an accrual change relating to this deal with a customer. We have some severance and other miscellaneous costs. So if I look at those, you've got, call it, $0.70 of the roughly $1 is associated with timing versus true cost impact. When I roll that forward into 2020, about $0.50 of that is going to roll into 2020. So the breakdown there is, in Japan, two of the three assets are being pushed into 2020. Our Miyagi asset, however, is not just based on where we see the timing of construction and the Gen 5 today. Now, if that changes that could get pulled in later, but as of now, that's not in the guidance for 2020. The other pieces that previously we'd assumed the structuring of our Japan assets will go through this private fund that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, based on pulling the Miyagi asset out and the complexity we've have seen, I think we're targeting now selling those assets on a bilateral basis versus in a fund with a small impact to that. So that $0.50 to Japan, you are going to pull about $0.35 through. The other timing piece, you're going to pull about $0.15 of the $0.20, that's a function of - in the U.S., although we hit substantial completion on the projects that we were targeting by year-end, we had some small cost increases to do so, as well as the fact that on the India assets, we just had some diminishing value, as we've been negotiating those sale contracts. So if you look at it, you can assume about $0.50 gets rolled 2019 to 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Hi, guys. So I guess, could you talk about like your low cash balance point, what do you think it is with all your CapEx? And then my second question is just on, I guess, we're all trying to figure out like cost per watt, we're using $0.21 or something like that and how off are we on the mark there going forward? Thanks. Alex Bradley : Yeah. So on -- Ben, on cash, so you've got two big things this year, you've got the remainder of the Series 6 CapEx, so we talked originally about $2 billion of capital associated with what was then 6.6 gigawatts of capacity. So we are largely through that about 250 of the midpoint $500 guidance announced for the year is the finalization of that initial capacity. Of the remaining, there's about $100 million that is associated with increasing Perrysburg's capacity and that takes us from the current $1.9 billion up to the long term run rate by year-end 2021 of about $2.4 billion. So that extra $100 million is getting you about 0.5 gigawatt of capacity. And then in the year, there's about another $150 million, which is other miscellaneous capacity expansion plus other spend. So if you think about that by the end of this year, we're largely through, not only the initial CapEx program, but a lot of the CapEx that is going to take us through the increasing capacity that we showed on the slide that takes us up to a nameplate of 8 gigawatts by the end of 2021. The other piece that you have got to remember is, you're starting the year out by immediately pulling $350 million of cash out when we settled the class action lawsuit. So when you think about the low point, this should be the low point we think by the end of the year. If you look at anticipated CapEx going beyond assuming no incremental greenfield or brownfield expansion that isn't counted in these numbers today, we should be at a high point spend. We are through a lot of our CapEx by the end of the year and we should start to build cash thereafter. Mark Widmar : Yeah, I think, the thing about this, Ben, when you go into, especially in 2021 CapEx, burn rate is down significantly and then you've got, as we show in the production plan, supply plan that we anticipated to have about 2 gigawatts of incremental shipment in 2021, so you've got 5, 7 relative to a high end of 7, 7 in 2021. So that is going to drive incremental - significant incremental cash flows because that contribution margin largely is going to flow through to cash. As it relates to cost per watt, Ben, look I think the - we haven't given a discrete number, but there is many numbers that are right around that range and those are numbers that we, as said before that we're comfortable with and we've got a near-term issue, we're still working through with Perrysburg and got headwind against the fleet, which I highlighted in our remarks of about $0.01 and we expect it to work that out over time, but not in 2021 and we've got actually into 2020, but we've got ramp-related costs and other things that are flowing through and severance as we make the commissioning costs and other things like that are starting to flow through the results for 2020. But the other thing I want to make sure, that we don't miss is that we have many levers to go, let's use your leaping off point just as an example. The levers on which we can continue to drive cost down are significant and highlighted in the slide that we showed in the - during the call. Just the increase, today we're at an average of 435 type number, slightly lower than 435 and if we take that up to 500 that's tremendous increase in watts, which largely is scale correlates specifically to a reduction in cost per watt throughput that we have, the team has done a tremendous job of putting forth a road map that can take our original nameplate capacity of a factory and increase it by a third, that's another significant lever. So I think, there is a near-term issue that we're dealing with, but when we look across the horizon and where we can ultimately go from a cost and performance standpoint of our product, we're extremely happy with where we are and what the potential is in front us. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Hey, on Slide 18, is it your intention to show that costs are coming down about half of where they - half of the starting point? Is that diagram for scale or is that non-intentional? Mark Widmar : No. Mike, if you - it may not be clear, but you look at the footnote there, it says, not to scale. So that's non-entity. Michael Weinstein : Okay. I mean is there any particular reason why you don't give an exact number? Is it competitive reason for something or is there some other reason? Mark Widmar : Yes. It's exactly right. So look, we are out selling the value of the product, right? So if you look at - I'll give you an example. If you look at our 2.6 gigawatts kind of gross basis that we booked within the quarter, the average ASP across that 2.6, which includes volume that goes out into '22 and '23 is slightly down from the average that we reported in the last Q, which I think if you do the math on the last Q was somewhere around $0.34 or something like that. We're selling through out into an horizon that's '22 and '23 and we're still holding very strong ASPs. And the value of CuRe hasn't been captured in that horizon yet. So we have -- our contractual structure as we go that far out will allow us to capture the value of the energy that the product can ultimately deliver on a long term degradation benefit, temporary coefficient benefit, spectral response efficiency, everything. So it all can accrete value, as we move forward. If we were to provide a discrete costs that gave you a number that's out into '21, '22 and '23, then my customer starts to hold me accountable to a cost-plus model. And that's not what we want to do, we want to be out there selling the full entitlement of the value that we create and not get stuck on a cost plus. And so we have purposely moved away from giving discrete cost per watt. There is - if you or adapt that modeling, you can easily take the inputs that we've given to give you is an indication. There is room still to go as we move forward and I think that's really what's most important. As you think through the window this business is going to continue to scale, we're going to maintain and hold a relatively tight fixed cost structure and we'll leverage that and drive incremental operating margin, right. And that's what we've been saying since day one. And the more transparent I am with our cost number the more vulnerable I am to really realize the full potential of the business model that we've created and the technology and we want to capture the value of that technology. Operator : Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, can you hear me? Mark Widmar : Yeah. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Hey guys, just wanted to talk a little bit about the systems business again, sort of status quo, as the independent of monetization here, what systems volumes are we talking about nominal terms, I know the things are moving around here, you recognized in 2020 and then on an ongoing basis, as you think about the size and scale of your operations today. Again, this is also with the thought process of what is this business worth in the monetization scenario? As we think through these peak systems years coming up here as you guys have previously talked about hedging upwards that gigawatt size number in terms of annual systems business, where does that stand now '20, '21, and sort of go forward if you will? Mark Widmar : Yeah. Julien, so we previously guided to 1 gig and sometimes up to 1.5 gig and that 1.5 gig a year was also partly EPC project. So as we've now moved away from internal EPC to a third-party execution model, the best we can give you is to anchor around that gigawatt a year of volume. As I mentioned in 2020, you are not going to see that relatively flow through the Systems segment, just given how we structured some of these deals. So the same volume as that was approximately originated through the Systems segment through that channel, but on the accounting side, by virtue of how we structure those deals, you're going to see that mostly flow through the Module segment in 2020. But absent any change to -- any strategic change here that we've been discussing, continue to model around that gigawatt a year. The other thing I'd say is, as you go further out, we have safe harbor 2 gigawatts of capacity, we would like to try and use that out in more in '22 and 2023. That was largely sold through a lot of our capacity in the near term and we've done so capturing full value entitlement for the module. So we've been able to do that without losing much money relative to a system sale, but without taking the risk of those systems deal. So I think from a relative risk perspective, we've captured full value in the next couple of years. We think if you look through into 2022 and 2023, when the relative delta between a safe harbor 30% ITC project relative to going down than towards China is great. So that's when we're looking to deploy that product. And so in terms of value, the significant value creation now in '22 and '23. Operator : Your next question comes from Moses Sutton with Barclays. Your line is open. Moses Sutton : Thanks for taking my question. For the systems business, assuming you find a partner that, let's say, solves the basis and related risks, how might cost need to come down, the core cost itself, given you're moving to third-party EPC to let's say allow you to bid at PPA prices of $30 a megawatt hour, while still maintaining say around the 20% margin as a developer? Mark Widmar : Cost, as it relates to our own development cost to achieve that margin, first up, I don't -- I never -- given where we are right now and where PPA prices or module prices or anythings move toward, I'm not sure that a margin percent is always necessarily the best way to look at it, partly because the development revenue stream number from a sense perspective is relatively low. I would actually like to ensure that we can capture at least 30% to 40% margin on our development activities in order to say that it's sustainable and a position that we want to maintain, because you have to look at the risk profile that you're taking, I mean, every time - and this is why our preference is to do more EOG and that's what we're trying to position ourselves. Every time there is a change in emerging curve that gets published every six months, there is a risk that you're taking, because you did a of merchant curve two years ago, a year ago, whatever it is, that every time that gets updated, especially with shorter tenure PPAs, I've got a risk for every time a merchant curve moves one way or the other. And so we prefer to try to find long tenure of PPAs, we also prefer to look to EOG which I just have to worry about either providing a site with a module agreement or building a power plant and transferring that to the long-term owner, but there's others that are willing to take those other types of risk and it's the risk they're comfortable with taking and we just would like to see if there is a path out there that we could partner with someone that is comfortable with those risks and has ways to manage those types of risk that I would say we're not in a position to do today. I mean, if you look at Texas as the market, Texas as a market is a very strong market. We do extremely well in Texas from a module standpoint. We just haven't been successful doing development because the hedge contract structure that you see in Texas, the merchant exposure you see in Texas, the basis risk that's in Texas, I mean those are not things that we are good at managing or hedging those types of risk profiles, but others are. And do we find a path that we can be complimentary, we can continue to develop and provide great, a module product and build it need be a power plant, but somebody else is willing to step in to take those other risks. And so those are paths we're looking at and we're also looking at with somebody who will be willing to team with us at the time of bidding into a PPA where they're willing to provide underwriting assumptions we lock in on how we underwrite a PPA, and then a hedge my exposure from the time of award versus carrying risk profile forward until time of sell down our COD or whatever point in time that may be. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions. This concludes this conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2020 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update and discuss First Solar's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook for 2020. Following the remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today, especially in light of the extraordinary situation that we're all facing. I hope each of you and your loved ones are safe. I want to begin by discussing the country's response to the COVID-19 global health crisis, including the impacts we are seeing on our business and the actions we are taking to support our associates, customers and partners. Turning to Slide 3. Firstly, and most importantly, we are committed to our associates, customers and partners around the world. We are working to navigate this unprecedented challenge together with safety as our top priority. At this time, the majority of our office-based associates are working from home to minimize large concentrations of people at our offices and manufacturing facilities. As a technology manufacturing company, we do require certain associates to be physically present at our production facilities. In these locations, we have implemented stringent health and safety protocols that include, among other measures, temperature screenings at facility checkpoints, a mask requirement for all our manufacturing associates, a round-the-clock sanitation of high-touch areas and social distancing. In order to further protect our associates, we have also implemented strict limitations on third-party visitors to our offices and manufacturing sites. Through these practices, we strive to protect the well-being of our global associates and ensure that our technology is safely manufactured and delivered to our customers. In meeting the clean energy needs of the global economy, we will continue to balance our top priority of safety with delivering value to each of our stakeholders. We recognize the challenges that our associates and their families are facing in this period of great uncertainty. And we're very proud of the dedication, focus and commitment that we witnessed from our associates over the past months. It is during challenging times like these that our culture of agility, collaboration and accountability and the strength of our differentiated business model shine through. Turning to Slide 4. Our core operating principle is to endeavor to create shareholder value through a disciplined, data-driven, decision-making framework that delivers a balanced business model of growth, profitability and liquidity. With this guiding principle, we will continue to adapt our business model to remain competitive and differentiated in a constantly evolving market through our points of differentiation, which include a competitively advantaged cad tel thin-film module technology, a vertically integrated continuous manufacturing process, an industry-leading balance sheet strength and a prominent sustainability ideology. We have created a resilient business model that better enables us to manage through periods of uncertainty, including the current environment. The strength of our business model is reflected in our committed Series six road map capacity of approximately eight gigawatts and our multiyear contracted backlog of over 12 gigawatts. We are pleased with the contracted backlog we have built as it provides increased visibility into our future sales, reduces financial exposures to spot pricing and aligns our capacity plan with future demand. Turning to Slide 5. I will next provide an update on our module and systems businesses. On March 26, we provided a manufacturing operations update in light of recent developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, we indicated our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam were committed to operate under their respective circumstances and government mandates. Through today's earnings call, we continue to manufacture Series six under their local government orders, which include the following. Firstly, on March 22, the state of Ohio issued stay-at-home order, which was extended to May 29. Recently, the Ohio government rolled out a plan to gradually reopen other parts of the state's economy, while still minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Through today's earnings call, our Ohio facilities have been permitted to operate as an essential business under the stay-at-home order. However, with the closing of schools and the associated day care needs as well as other factors, we have experienced a decrease in our production workforce. In March and April, our Ohio one site operated at full capacity. However, the temporary decrease in labor availability yielded an approximately 25% reduction in capacity at our Ohio two during these months. Starting in May, essentially the entire manufacturing workforce has returned, and we expect Ohio two will return to full capacity. During this period of transition, we incurred some incremental costs for overtime and supplemental pay. Secondly, on March 18, the government of Malaysia enacted a movement control order, which was extended to May 12, and from which First Solar was exempted as an essential business. Under the order, the workforce at the factory had to be reduced by 50% to improve social distancing while maintaining full pay for all associates. In order to comply with the order, we elected to maintain Series six production while halting Series 4. We have anticipated discontinuing Series four production during the second quarter of 2020. Prior to the movement control order coming into effect, we had produced approximately 2/3 of our expected 300 megawatts of Series four production for the year. Taking into account inventory on hand, future expected warranty requirements and following engagement with certain customers to replace Series four with Series six modules, we have elected to accelerate our Series four shutdown and will not restart Series four module production. However, due to the movement control order, we have experienced some delays in completing the exit process of our impacted associates. However, despite operating under the reduced workforce reduction, through labor optimization and a work-from-home strategy for all nonessential Series six manufacturing associates, we achieved Series six capacity utilization rates above 100% at our factory in Malaysia during March and April. Thirdly, on April 1, the government of Vietnam ordered a period of nationwide isolation, which required compliance with government-mandated safety criteria in order to continue manufacturing operations. We implemented all requirements and continued to operate at over 100% of nameplate capacity during March and April. A significant achievement to highlight, the team's commitment to safety was recognized by government auditors as we achieved the best safety score out of the 15 large manufacturing facilities audited in the Ho Chi Minh City area. Our operational performance to date has been facilitated by our strong supply chain partnerships, which have enabled us to minimize disruptions to raw material supplies to the factory. Throughout the crisis, the vast majority of our third-party suppliers have continued to serve us. In cases where we have had challenges in our supply chain, we have substantially mitigated those disruptions through active dialogues with our vendors and implemented implementation of contingency plans. To date, delays related to procurement of raw materials and components have not exceeded a week. From a shipping and logistics perspective, we have seen disruptions in global cargo routes and capacity. Despite sailing cancellations, port congestion and staffing reductions, the impact on inbound raw material deliveries have so far been limited. We continue to work with our partners and customers to mitigate these disruptions. Finally, with regards to customer deliveries. In several instances, our customers are experiencing delays in their permitting and EPC process, which is affecting our ability to - for them to receive our module. In all cases, we continue to collaborate with our customers and provide solutions to challenges they are facing as a result of the current environment. We are committed to meeting the needs of our customers, while the delivery date changes may impact the timing of revenue recognition on our module sales. Turning to the systems business. With regards to early stage development, the most significant impact of the pandemic is the inability to hold public gatherings, which are often a step required in completing the permitting process. Accordingly, our development team is evaluating the potential to utilize virtual meetings to fully satisfy these requirements. From a PPA standpoint, we have continued to make significant additions to our contracted pipeline in the United States and Japan. Since the prior earnings call, we have been awarded three PPAs for projects located in Tennessee, California and Texas across a diverse set of utility, CCA and corporate offtakers. These projects secure system volume in the time period that captures the full value entitlement of our ITC safe harbor strategy and copper replacement program. Additionally, these projects have module shipment dates based between 2021 and 2023, which importantly extends our contracted backlog into later years. From the construction standpoint, we are nearing completion of the last remaining projects being constructed in-house by First Solar's EPC and the remaining projects currently under construction being financed on our balance sheet and executed by third-party EPC partners. While our construction projects have experienced some combination of constraints related to COVID-19, such as certain balanced system supply delays and schedule impacts related to labor availability, we have been working with relevant stakeholders to remediate any project schedule delays. The majority of these delays at this time have been mitigated. As it relates to project sales, these require input from and coordination with multiple government and private sector counterparties across a variety of development and financing areas, many of which have faced disruptions in business operations. Therefore, we expect to see delays in project sales in the United States, Japan and India. However, our strong net cash position provides us with financing flexibility and the option to balance sheet finance project construction as well as temporary hold operating assets through periods of market dislocation or disruption in order to create options to maximize value. Alex will discuss this later in greater detail. With regard to O&M, as one of the world's largest O&M providers, we continue to safely and effectively manage our utility-scale portfolio, so these power plants can continue to generate reliable clean electricity. Our O&M business is well positioned for the current environment as our strategy emphasizes remote monitoring, analytics and predictive maintenance to optimize power plant health and minimize on-site presence. In our operations center at our global headquarters in Arizona, we have implemented stringent health and safety measures in seating arrangements in line with recommended social distancing protocols. As a result of these measures, our O&M business continues to efficiently and safely meet the needs of our customers. Turning to Slide 6. I will next provide a market, technology and manufacturing outlook. While we are monitoring the near-term impacts of solar procurement, the catalysts for driving increased utility-scale solar penetration continue to grow. Firstly, in many markets, new-build utility-scale solar is economically competitive with fossil fuel generation on both a total and marginal cost basis. In fact, at the start of 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated that the United States will see six gigawatts of uneconomical coal capacity decommissioned in 2020, while 13.5 gigawatts of new utility-scale solar would be installed. Secondly, our technology's performance and reliability are well understood. With over 600 gigawatts of cumulative capacity installed globally through the end of 2019, solar has transitioned from an alternative to a mainstream energy resource. Finally, while solar experienced a period of significant expansion over the past decade, we are still in the early innings of growth. Although United States has 80 times more solar installed today than it did a decade ago, the 77 gigawatts of installed solar capacity only accounts for 2% of the country's electricity generation. Against the backdrop of growth in demand for cleaner electricity and global commitments to achieve climate goals, we see significant runway for solar installation growth. Our Series six capacity plan is well positioned to capture a rapidly growing global PV market. In this context, I would like to note that our long-term capacity expansion road map is essentially unchanged. To date, the only shift in production strategy is delaying the plan 2020 optimization of our Vietnam factories. This elective decision reduces downtime in 2020, and we expect this will partially offset underutilization of our Ohio two factory. Shifting to our technology road map, our long-term technology road map remains unchanged to date. However, as operational limitations at our advanced research lab in Santa Clara, California, continue for an extended period, the timing of this road map may be delayed. As the only U.S.-based company among the 10 largest PV module manufacturers globally, we are committed to manufacturing and diversifying our supply chain in the United States and supporting U.S. manufacturing jobs within First Solar and externally. A good example of this commitment is a supply agreement with a glass provider that enable the construction of a new glass-float facility approximately 10 miles from our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing site. On a similar note, we are pleased with the decision in April of the office of the United States Trade Representative supporting the removal of the exclusion of bifaced solar panels from the Section 201 safeguard measures and are monitoring the resolution of the related litigation in the U.S. Court of International Trade. While we have been able to contract through the iterations of the bifacial exemption, we believe this decision of the U.S. Trade Representative is consistent with the underlying intent of Section 201 measures and helps promote a level playing field for U.S. solar manufacturing and innovation an environment of both free and fair trade. Turning to Slide 7. I would like to briefly highlight our bookings activity for the quarter. Despite the uncertain economic environment, demand for our Series six product remains strong as evidenced by the 1.1 gigawatts of net bookings since our prior earnings call. Included in this total are approximately 0.4 gigawatts of third-party module sales and 0.7 gigawatts of systems bookings. In addition, 0.7 gigawatts of the net bookings is for deliveries in 2022 and 2023. This demand for Series six and the strength of First Solar as a trusted partner have resulted in a year-to-date net bookings of 1.8 gigawatts. After accounting for shipments of 1.3 gigawatts in the first quarter, our future expected shipments are 12.3 gigawatts. Internationally, we are pretty pleased with approximately 60 megawatts we've booked in Japan since our prior earnings call. Although procurement volume has slowed in Europe, India and Latin America, we are cautiously optimistic that demand will recover after the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning to Slide 8. As mentioned previously, the catalyst for increased solar penetration continues to grow. As such, we expect our mid- to late-stage pipeline of opportunities to continue to support the growth of our contracted backlog. In terms of segment mix, the pipeline of 7.5 gigawatts includes 6.3 gigawatts of potential modules sales with the remaining 1.2 gigawatts representing potential systems business. In terms of geographic breakdown, North America remains a region with the largest number of opportunities at 5.2 gigawatts, Europe represents 1.6 gigawatts, with the remainder in other geographies. Finally, operationally, I am very pleased with our manufacturing execution, particularly given these extraordinary circumstances. During March and April, megawatts produced per day was 14.8 and 15.3, respectively. Capacity utilization was over 100% in both periods. Manufacturing yield was 94.5% and 95.4%. Average watts per module was 433 and 435 watts. The percentage of modules produced with antireflective coating was 97% and 98%. And the ARC bin distribution from 430 to 440 watt modules was 94% and 96%. From an entitlement perspective, we have demonstrated capacity utilization of 120% at each of our factories in Vietnam and Malaysia. Enabling and sustaining this incremental throughput, coupled with our module efficiency road map, gives us confidence we can continue reducing our module cost per watt. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our first quarter financial results and outlook for 2020. Alex? Alexander Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Given the unique circumstances related to the virus, I'll spend only a few minutes discussing first quarter financial results. I'll then provide a framework for how we're evaluating our financial and operational outlook and some of the key risks we see in the current landscape. Turning to Slide nine and starting with the income statement. Net sales in Q1 were $532 million. On a segment basis, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our module segment revenue in Q1 was 74%. Gross margin was 17% in Q1. The systems segment gross margin was 11% and was negatively impacted by low overall revenue recognized in the quarter relative to the systems segment fixed costs. This was positively offset by the sale of several early-stage development assets in the U.S. Module segment gross margin was 19% in Q1, which was negatively impacted by $10 million of severance and Series four decommissioning costs, $4 million of a high O2 ramp costs and $4 million of underutilization and excess yield losses driven by temporary declines in capacity utilization. In the aggregate, this impacted module segment gross margin by approximately five percentage points. Operating expenses were $89 million in Q1. And of note, this includes approximately $5 million of legal fees associated with the settled class action and active of debt litigation, $4 million of severance costs related to the February reduction in force and $3 million of expected credit losses on our accounts receivable as a result of the economic disruption caused by COVID-19. In the aggregate, these items increased Q1 operating expenses by $12 million. As a result of the previously mentioned factors, we had operating income of $2 million in Q1. In Q1, we realized a $15 million gain on sale of certain securities associated with our end-of-life recycling program within the other income line on the P&L. This benefit was partially offset by $13 million of credit losses associated with certain notes receivable from one of our investments. During the quarter, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately $89 million related to the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act. The discrete benefit will be partially offset by a related rate impact expected over the remainder of 2020, and we therefore expect a full year net benefit from the CARES Act of approximately $70 million. Additionally, we expect a shift in our jurisdictional mix of income for the remainder of 2020, which we expect to increase the full year tax rate by approximately two percentage points. The combination of the aforementioned items led to first quarter earnings per share of $0.85. Turning to Slide 10, I'll discuss select balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Our cash, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended Q1 at $1.6 billion. Our net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, ended Q1 at $1.1 billion. Our net cash position decreased relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to the payment of the $350 million class action litigation settlement; Series six capital expenditures, which were primarily related to our second Series six factory in Malaysia; the decrease in module prepayments following an increase in Q4 2019 associated with ITC's safe harbor module purchase orders and prepayments for components included on the module builder materials. Cash flows used in operations were $505 million in Q1, primarily due to payment of the litigation settlement and the previously mentioned decrease in module prepayments. Finally, capital expenditures were $113 million in the first quarter. In terms of the financial and operational outlook, we recognize these are truly unique times. And for that reason, we're taking a different approach to our guidance discussion today. Turning to Slide 11. In Q1, we were able to mitigate a significant portion of the impact on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the location of our manufacturing facilities in the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam, the location of the majority of our customers of 2020 module sales in the U.S. and the location of the majority of our project asset sales in the U.S. and Japan, the impact was only felt towards the tail end of the first quarter. To date, the company's financial results have not been materially impacted by COVID-19. However, given the significant uncertainties I'll describe momentarily and their potential impacts on our operations and financial results as well as on energy and capital markets, we are withdrawing our full year 2020 guidance. These uncertainties include but are not limited to, firstly, the number, intensity and trajectory of COVID-19 cases globally. Secondly, the actions of federal, state, local and foreign governments in response to pandemic. Thirdly, our third-party suppliers' ability to continue maintaining production and delivery of raw materials and components to our manufacturing sites. Fourthly, volatility in the capital markets, including the tax equity market in the U.S., which may affect the value and optimal timing of our asset sales. Fifthly, logistical constraints, including reduced shipping capacity and port congestion. And finally, the results of local and national assets to gradually reopen economies. We are, however, providing limited guidance for metrics that we believe are largely within our control at this time. This includes a view on full year 2020 module production, 2020 CapEx related to our long-term manufacturing capacity expansion and a view on operating expenses and the efforts we are undertaking to optimize costs as we work through the current pandemic. Beginning with the module business, we anticipate full year 2020 production of approximately 5.9 gigawatts, which includes 0.2 gigawatts of Series four and 5.7 gigawatts of Series 6. From a shipment and sales perspective, whilst we're effectively sold out relative to our 2020 production plan, going forward, we could experience delays in shipments. And the purchases of our PV modules could encounter delays in their ability to take receipt of modules or in the development, financing and/or construction of that project. We're in active dialogue and collaborating with our customers to alleviate COVID-19 constraints where possible. As a result of these assets, the timing of module revenue recognition has the potential to move within 2020 or shift from 2020 to 2021. From a long-term perspective, our 2020 Series six manufacturing capacity plans remain unchanged. We expect to spend $450 million to $550 million of CapEx in 2020, the majority of which is Series six related. And we remain on track to bring our second Series six factory in Malaysia online in the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to our systems business, I'd like to highlight the risks related to the timing of our contracted asset sales in the U.S., Japan and India. Firstly, government shutdowns and restrictions on businesses and operations have resulted in longer lead times for the critical steps in the financing, function and asset sale proceeds. We're working relentlessly with relevant counterparties to ensure the timely success of the activity is required to execute our project sales. Secondly, during the first quarter, a number of prominent financial institutions increased their credit loss reserves as a result of COVID-19. These reserves have the potential to reduce bank profitability. In the U.S., the availability of tax equity is largely driven by the profitability of a discrete set of financial institutions. Several of these institutions also cited a risk of further deterioration in the U.S. macroeconomic environment, namely a decline in GDP and further increases in unemployment. To the extent that these scenarios hold, these institutions may be subject to further loan loss reserves, thus reducing their profitability and tax capacity. To the extent bank profitability is adversely impacted and the availability of tax equity is constrained in the United States, we continue to believe a legislative solution, such as the ability to receive direct payments in place of investment tax credits, is appropriate to alleviate the structural constraints in the tax equity market. This solution will be directly related to COVID-19 pandemic response and efforts to support U.S. employment. We believe such action is critical to support high-quality solar construction jobs, many of which were at further risk, except the tax equity market is disrupted and what advocates for the U.S. Congress consider this as an approach in the next round of legislative responses to the pandemic. Thirdly, project valuations could be impacted by volatility and availability of capital in the equity and debt financing markets. We've seen return expectations of long-term response to equity holds flat, although base interest rates have declined since the start of the year. Of note, infrastructure funds achieved a strong fundraising total for Q1. Utility-scale solar fits well into this narrative as a hedge to equity market turbulence with long-term useful lives and cash flow profile without exposure to input quality fuel costs. From a debt perspective, while base interest rates have declined since the start of the year, credit spreads across investment and noninvestment-grade debt widened. At the same time, the CARES Act has provided a beneficial temporary increase in interest deductibility. Ultimately, the amount, cost and tenure of debt and its value to a project will be determined by the overall credit worthiness of the project. Whilst the uncertain spoken duration of COVID-19 has impacted global markets, we continue to prioritize maximizing project valuation. Accordingly, we may elect to hold our project assets on balance sheet for an extended period based on strategic opportunities or market factors. As it relates to operating expenses, while the pandemic presented new challenges, even before the outbreak, we had already been proactively optimizing our business and long-term sustainable cost structure. For example, in September 2019, we announced the transition to a third-party EPC execution model to enhance project development cost competitiveness and de-risk project distribution for the company. And our final project being constructed by our in-house EPC team is advancing towards completion. In February of 2020, while we had a broader business and cost structure review, we affected a reduction in force. In May of 2020, we affected the continuation of this reduction in force to streamline and further optimize each line of business. Although we expect this reduction to lead to $8 million in long-term run rate savings, in 2020, we expect to see severance-related impacts from this action of approximately $2 million. From the combined February and May reductions, severance now totaled $12 million with expected long-term run rate savings of $33 million to $43 million. In February, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we also announced that we're evaluating strategic options for our U.S. project development business. We continue to work with our financial advisers to determine the optimal path and timing for this process. I would like to note that the current global business operational impacts from COVID-19 may result in companies focusing more on internal initiatives rather than on pursuing new partnerships or M&A deals. And as a result, this may impact the timing of the process. Each of these proactive and strategic decisions align with our vision to accelerate technology, cost and product leadership, to balance growth, profitability and liquidity and to enable us to best position ourselves both during this disruption as well as for the long term. Finally, our $1.6 billion gross and $1.1 billion net cash position remains a strategic differentiator that enables not only stability but also growth in innovation in periods of both economic prosperity and uncertainty. We intend to vigorously maintain the strong liquidity position, and at this time, do not expect to draw on our revolving credit facility. Turning to Slide 12, I'll summarize the key messages on today's call. Firstly, we had Q1 earnings per share of $0.85 and quarter end net cash of $1.1 billion. Secondly, we achieved fleet-wide capacity and utilization of approximately 100% during March and April and have demonstrated capacity utilization of 120% at each of our factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, which gives us confidence that we execute on our cost reduction road map. Despite challenges relating to the pandemic, we are pleased with both our operational and financial performance, achieving results in line with our pre-COVID-19 expectations. Thirdly, demand for our Series six technology remains strong. And we have continued success adding to our contracted pipeline, with net bookings of 1.1 gigawatts since the prior earnings call and 1.8 gigawatts of bookings year-to-date. Finally, given the significant uncertainty posed by the current pandemic, we are withdrawing our previous full year operational and financial guidance. We are, however, at this time able to provide full year 2020 production guidance of approximately 5.9 gigawatts, full year 2020 capital expenditure guidance of $450 million to $550 million and full year 2020 operating expense guidance of $340 million to $360 million, which includes $50 million to $60 million of start-up expenses. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Mr. Philip Shen [Roth Capital Partners]. Philip Shen : First one is, you guys announced a large 400-megawatt order for modules yesterday, I believe, with the National Grid subsidiary for delivery in 2022. What kind of pricing were you able to secure with that order? And beyond that order, can you talk through how pricing is evolving in general? Our check suggests module pricing globally could be down an additional 10% to 15% from current levels, given the oversupply. And so to what degree is that impacting your conversations? Mark Widmar : Yes, Phil. I guess on the pricing side, again, one of the things, I think, we continue to emphasize and one of the points we want to continue to make is, again, how we manage our business and how we continue to try to differentiate ourselves and continue to position our technology to capture the optimal value in the marketplace. If you look at it on a year-to-date basis on the third-party module sales, everything that we booked year-to-date, call it, 1.1, 1.2, somewhere close to that number of the 1.8, the aggregate bookings are - have a 3-handle on it still. So if you look at the average that we've recognized so far against - on a year-to-date basis, it still has a 3-handle on it. Now as you go further out, there's two things that will show you a different complexion around the ASPs. One is how far out are we booking into in some of those module sales like, in particular, the one that you referenced is actually for shipments in 2022 and deliveries, I think, even starts to touch into 2023. So that's one thing. So the further out we go, as you would anticipate, the ASPs will have some amount of erosion as you move forward. The other is geographies of which we're recognizing the - where the models are going to be shipped. So the regions where we have the best value creation, hot humid climates, in particular, we're going to see higher ASPs. So if I had to give you a kind of - if you look at the average, you're going to see an advantage of probably to the average of $0.01 per $0.015 above the average when we're in kind of various core sweet markets for us like a Florida or even a Texas, okay, a Georgia. If you go north - the further north you go, you're going to see some downward pressure on the ASP. And so you may be $0.01 or $0.015 lower than the average if you're in Illinois, as an example. And so the order that we booked with Geronimo, which is, to your point, affiliated with our subsidiary of National Grid, some of that volume, a significant portion of that volume is going to be further up north in markets where we don't have as strong an energy advantage. So that - and it's further out in the horizon, so it sits out into '22 and even it touches '23. So where that volume is going to be north and then further out on the horizon, you're going to see a slightly lower ASP. And so across that average we've booked this year, does some of that volume have a 2, a very high and - a 2-handle on it, but a very high in the two range, it does. The average is still north of 3. And even when you go out into - further in the horizon, call it out into '22 and '23, if we're in a market or hot humid environment, we're still going to - we're still seeing three handles, okay? That's what we're seeing right now. Now again, we have plenty of time to be patient. I'm not holden - beholden to excess supply. Our book is full for the next 1.5 years. And so we can be very selective. We can engage with customers who value our technology, value our relationship with First Solar that we'll - they know we'll deliver, we'll honor against our contracts, and we'll provide a high-quality product. So as you get into that horizon, customers are looking for CuRe in that longer-dated horizon. I think we've got a unique value proposition, plus a lot of that volume that we did with Geronimo, I think almost all of it, is for our new copper replacement product that will create different advantages, better long-term degradation, even improved temperature coefficient. So we're happy with that booking. It's a great partnership relation we've had with them. And we're very happy with them being able to secure that volume. And I would say on balance that everything I've seen so far, I'm still happy with the ASP environment that we're in, given some of the numbers that you've quoted. And unfortunately, maybe some of our other competitors who have excess supply or an open book is maybe a better way to say, yes, they're going to see very challenging near-term ASPs. Operator : And we have our second question from Mr. Brian Lee [Goldman Sachs]. Brian Lee : I hope everyone is doing well. I guess first question I had was just on the gross margins in modules. They were up maybe 50 basis points versus Q4 like-for-like if we exclude some of the onetime items you highlighted, Alex. I guess I would have expected a bit more improvement with Series six volume growing here and Series four also lower in the mix and given the ongoing cost reduction. So the question would be just that the 10% decline in module production costs in 2020, is that still on track for the year? And then is there anything else in the quarter that might have limited the margin expansion versus where you ended 2019? And then second question, if I could just squeeze this in is on the systems business. Just wondering, that seems to be an area where you might have the most COVID-19 risk. So how much of your original revenue guidance for the systems segment this year was based on projects that had PPAs, but hadn't been sold versus projects that had already been sold and just need to recognize revenue ratably as they're complete this year. So just trying to see what that risk is if it's really about the project sales that you outlined or the projects that don't have sales status in the 10-K? Alexander Bradley : Yes. So I mean, on the gross margin, we commented on the pieces that are having a negative impact to the quarter. I can't talk much more beyond that. What I can say is that when you talk about the 10% reduction over the year, I'd say we're very pleased with how things are going in the first quarter. If you look at - we've had a couple of COVID-related expenses. But stripping those out, I think, we are very pleased with the manufacturing performance and the cost performance. I'd say, we believe we're on track for that reduction over the year as of Q1. As it relates to the systems business, so when we guided to the year, we said around 30% of the revenue was coming out of the systems business. If you look in the Q, you will see in the pipeline table, there's very limited assets there that have already been sold where we're continuing to recognize revenue. Those limited assets remain - are up and around 90-or-above percent complete. So the majority of the systems revenue for the year was coming from assets that have yet to be sold. Those are assets both in the U.S. and in Japan. And so that's what - one of the significant reasons when we looked at - on the guidance, what we chose to do in terms of not only giving guidance but significant driver of that was uncertainty around the systems business. And that relates to uncertainty around the timing of financing. And if you look in the U.S., I think tax equity and debt markets, they stand and are generally open for deals that were begun prior to pandemic. We have some assets where financing is in place, others where we're still looking to finance those deals. I think capacity for 2020 exists, 2021 tax capacity is still a lot less certain as the institutions are grappling with the impact of the prices and what it means for their future tax positions. On the debt side, the markets are generally open, but - although we've seen a surge of issuance on the investment-grade credit risk and expressed our guidance for better credits. So I think there's a piece of it around financing, but there's also significant logistical challenges you got to remember on the systems side, right? So asset sales involve multiple counterparties and significant logistical challenges to get done. So when we look at our portfolio, I think we believe that even those that aren't financed or sold are well positioned to get the financing they may need. We may sell them under a typical sales structure where the project is sold and the counterparty takes financing construction risk and that becomes a responsible purchaser. We may alternatively need it - find it present better value for us to do that financing and potentially even hold assets for a little bit longer. So I think a lot of what you're seeing is a timing issue. It's not a fundamental issue. But there are assets we hold that are yet to be sold and some of them are yet to be financed, and that's one of the key challenges to the guidance. Mark Widmar : Yes. And the only thing I'll add on the gross margin, Brian, when you look at it sequentially, a couple of things that are in the mix in there. One is that the - sequentially, the ASP is down for both four and 6, partly because the ASPs in the fourth quarter were benefited from the safe harbor pricing that was in the market at the time. Because, as you know, everybody was trying to capture their safe harbor and some of them took deliveries in - of that product in - by the end of the year. So you saw a little bit better ASPs associated with that, so you see a little bit of that. And the other is that there's still a reasonable amount - volume is down pretty significantly. So you see a pretty big drop in volume sold. And then there's still a reasonable amount of Series four that sits in the first quarter. Now as we move forward, the margin profile will continue to improve. There's about close to five percentage point difference between Series four and Series six when you look at it on a normalized adjusted basis. And as we move forward, you're going to see volume shipments move towards 100% from 36% as we get into second half, for sure, a little bit of Series four in the second quarter. But after that, it's all Series 6. And then as Alex indicated, you've got the benefit of the cost reduction road map as we progress through the balance of the year. And the fleet, yes, as Alex said, I think we're pretty happy with where we are with the fleet. There is some headwind that we're dealing with a little bit on - in Ohio and in Malaysia. Vietnam is performing extremely well. It's really the only factory that has really not been impacted in any way. Both Malaysia and Ohio have seen some impact. So what we'll probably most likely see is Vietnam will overperform for the year, and then they'll make up for some of the challenges that we've experienced here in Ohio as well as Malaysia. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Weinstein [Credit Suisse]. Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst : This is Maheep on behalf of Michael. Alex, you spoke about the timing issue for the systems that comes from the previous question. But could you talk about any timing issues on the module side, where you might be delaying shipments on the customers' request? And then how should we think about that in relation to any underabsorption on production versus shipments and that impact on the cost later this year? Alexander Bradley : Yes. So the impacts on the margin in some ways are similar. So when I say it's - one of the significant reasons for us having lack of clarity on our future guidance is the systems business. The issues we face on the systems business are the same issues our customers who are buying modules from us face on their projects. So a lot of our modules volume is going to customers who have projects that have financing, either in place or committed. However, there may be assets where that isn't the case. And if so, we may see customers requesting delays to allow them to close financing. And if that's the case, we'll work with customers as we can to accommodate their schedules. So I think there's definitely some overlap there. There's also some more simple issues on the modules side. We may have shipping constraints getting modules to their final delivery point, be that sea, rail or road. And we may find the same from customers, they have constraints to taking delivery reports on project sites. So from our side, one of the large drivers of lack of clarity around guidance was the systems business, but there are some of the same forces at play as it relates to the module business. And relating to the last question around gross margin, I think we're going to see some of that play out in Q2 as well. We already have a view of some module shipments being delayed out of Q2 into Q3 based on some of those factors I spoke about just now. As it relates to costs, it's not going to have a direct impact on our manufacturing costs. So it will have an impact on timing of rev-rec. Gross margins impacted us with lower revenue, and therefore, lower gross margins. We have less absorption of the fixed cost structure that sits across both our module and systems business. But otherwise, you see the manufacturing business continues to run the cost of base of interest rate. And we'll just see a timing of rev-rec and gross margin shift largely out into the second half of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Mr. Ben Kallo [Baird]. Ben Kallo : So my first question, there's a bunch of big projects out there that I'm reading about. Where are you on being on those? So like these gigawatt-type projects. I know you stayed clear of that before. And then my second question is, you went through all the, I think, four things about guidance before. But I calculated maybe like $0.40 of project business. And so I'm just wondering why you pulled guidance? And I think you guys have good visibility, but can you talk to your visibility on that? Mark Widmar : Yes. So Ben, on those large projects, I'm assuming maybe you're referencing some of the projects in the Middle East, which they've been big elephant hunting type of opportunities for module producers for a number of years. We were in early in some of those opportunities. And we did the very first demo project. And we provided the modules for the second one. And then what's happened ever since then on some of those large opportunities is people are just going extremely aggressive and very low pricing that is uneconomical. I guarantee that whoever is providing those modules, unless they're getting even incremental incentives to what they already have and being provided to them that there's - the module prices that they're trying to bid into those projects is that they're probably barely covering variable cost of the project. And so we've chosen not to participate in that. That's one reason why we have the strength of the contracted backlog that we have. We can be selective, and we're not looking to entertain and willing to participate in those types of opportunities. We have many other places that we can go to and capture better value for our technology. As it relates to visibility in - the biggest impact that we're having around guidance is the uncertainty of capital markets. And there's three large projects from revenue and margin penetration standpoint. There's American Kings and Sun Streams two here in the U.S., and then there's the Chicago project in Japan. There's a couple of other projects as well, but those really are the three largest revenue and margin contributors. And right now, we don't have great clarity around what's going to happen in the capital markets. And also the - we have expectations on what we think the value that is embedded in those assets, and I don't want to just go out and sell just to be beholden to an earnings or revenue commitment to the year if it means I'm going to get diminished value. We want to be able to optimize that value, and we've been very selective with doing that in the past. And we may end - in this case, end up holding some of those assets longer than we would have otherwise because we can capture better value when markets normalize back. And I think there's a lot of uncertainty right now. As Alex indicated, there are some positive indicators in the capital markets and there's potentially issues in the capital markets. Until everyone can kind of see what happens and sort of evaluate from their own perspective, we won't know till we know. And so we have to get out into the market and really get an update. We've got indication of value of assets pre-COVID. And unfortunately, what we need to do now is better - get a better indication of what the valuation of those assets would be post-COVID. So the systems business is a piece of it. But the other thing that Alex mentioned is not - we do have - we have firm committed contracted backlog and sold out for the year. So we have that. But - and a high percentage of our module - third-party module sales, customers have already gone out and they've closed on financing. There's a difference between us. I mean, we, obviously, have balance sheet financing. Most of our customers would go out and they get construction financing, tax equity bridge loans and everything else. So they've already got committed capital. So a good percentage of our backlog has committed capital. But there's other portion of our module shipments that our customers have not closed on their financing yet. So they need to do that. Though some of that's delayed, some of that pushed their schedule, and - we don't know yet. And so we have to get that insight to get - have a higher level of conviction around the module business and the contribution from revenue and earnings for the year. We've been in close contact with a number of them, but they are still highly confident in their ability to close. They're getting signals from the banks. And whether it's a debt side or the tax equity side, and they feel comfortable, but they're still uncertain. And so we felt that given where we are right now with all the uncertainty that we have, the right thing to do is to pull guidance. Now I can, and I think Alex said in his comments, we are very happy with how the year has started. We're very happy with everything that we've seen and as we move forward. If things return to what we had initially - what the world of the capital market was like in February, then we feel very confident we can still deliver against commitments that were made in February. But I don't know yet. I mean there's so much uncertainty that we feel right now, let's pull the guidance, make sure people understand kind of where we are, and we'll continue to provide the best information when we learn more, especially around the sell-down of our projects or if there's any customers that have, for whatever reasons, difficulty in closing financing for their projects. And then our project module shipment schedule gets pushed it off. Alexander Bradley : Yes. Ben, I just want to reiterate. I think this is a timing issue more than a business fundamental issue. So if you look at the comments we made in the script, our underlying demand is strong and shown by the bookings reported, including 0.8 gigawatts since the end of the quarter, right, after the end of the Q date, which was all during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you look at the other businesses, the underlying manufacturing fundamentals are strong and have shown - demonstrated really good throughput capacity in the factories. Efficiency is good. Cost borrowing, COVID-specific impact is good. CapEx capacity plans are on schedule. The OpEx metrics continue to improve. So we have the issues that we've just talked around - especially around systems business. But all this being said, the challenge with the guidance is our inability to forecast timing. We just don't have that clarity today. But business fundamental remains strong. Operator : And our next question comes from Mr. Colin Rusch. Unidentified Analyst : With those customers, can you give us a sense of the order of magnitude of customers that did not have committed capital and whether you're willing to step in, in terms of being a finance partner with those projects? Mark Widmar : Yes. So I mean, Colin, as you could expect, there's a portion of that order module backlog at utility-owned generation. So something's going into rate base that's already been approved through commission and all that. I mean, that's not a risk item, right? If anything, we're being hit directly and aggressively continue to produce and to make sure we deliver against commitments and schedules and everything else, right? So there's a portion of that. It's really the - it's more the PPA for segment and for - primarily for independent power producers or developers. And that's where the risk runs. And I would say the stuff that we're anticipating to deliver through to Q2 and Q3, largely financing is in place. Where you start seeing a little bit more of a gray area is projects that would be delivered in Q4 that released support CODs that start out in - there would be projects that would hit COD into 2021, call it, the second half of 2021. So we're about a year or so out from where those CODs are, and construction hasn't actually started in those places. So - and you've got to remember, this disruption has been with us now almost two months. And so people were going to go out, sort of hit the capital markets in kind of the end of Q1, beginning of Q2 that largely would have put their construction financing, tax equity bridge financing in place that then would have funded their construction and deliver against CODs in the second half, middle of 2021. So it's really the volume that sits in our fourth quarter that is our most exposure to the stuff. In Q2, Q3, it's not as much. And again, if anything, it's more directly tied to the utility-owned generation, which a portion is - of that volume is less risk at this point in time. I don't have the exact percentages that I can put you in each bucket, but I can just give you some color around where the exposure sits. Alexander Bradley : Yes. And I do think we'll see some impacts to Q2 and Q3, but those are going to be more related to logistics than they are with the financing. It's going to be a function of ability to ship and ability to receive relative to the plan versus financing, which for those projects are typically already in place. As Mark said, the financing challenges are more likely for later in the year deliveries or deliveries out in 2021. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.+",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to First Solar's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2020 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter as well as our outlook for 2020. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We continue to hope each of you are managing well as the pandemic continues. As we emphasized during our May earnings call, our COVID-19 response centers on balancing our top priority of safety with meeting our commitments to our customers. This approach together with our associates' dedication and the strength of our differentiated business model enabled us to deliver solid financial results for the second quarter and year-to-date with earnings of $0.35 per share and $1.20 per share respectively. Alex will discuss our results in greater detail. Starting on slide 3 with our module business, we remain pleased with our operational performance, with strong metrics across the board. Year-to-date, we have produced 3.5 gigawatts including 3.3 gigawatts of Series six modules. Fleet-wide capacity utilization has remained over 100% for the month of May, June and July. The fleet-wide capacity utilization is led by our international factories in Vietnam and Malaysia, which are progressing towards their previously demonstrated capacity utilization peak of 120% of initial design nameplate. Domestically, our Ohio one and two factories experienced 2.5 days of idle production in June, but still achieved respective utilization rates of over 100% and 94% during June. The unplanned downtime was caused by railway logistics constraints, which resulted in a delivery delay of certain bill of materials supply. As a result, we accelerated previously planned factory upgrades from the third quarter to minimize any impact to our full year production plan. On a fleet-wide basis in July megawatts produced per day was 15.9 megawatts. Manufacturing yield was 96.4%. Average watts per module was 435 watts and the ARC bin distribution from 430 to 440 modules was 98%. Vietnam had a particularly strong start to the quarter with capacity utilization of 114% and manufacturing yield 100 basis points above the fleet average. We are encouraged by the operational start to the quarter and the momentum it provides to further improve our cost per watt. Regarding our capacity road map, we remain on track to commence commercial production at our second Series six factory in Malaysia in the first quarter of 2021. However, third-party equipment installers as well as our U.S.-based associates are subject to international travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19. While we continue to work with relevant agencies to support this essential travel in a safe manner, incremental delays resulting from these restrictions may impact the timing of initial production. Since the previous earnings call, we have not experienced any significant operational disruption from our suppliers' inability to maintain manufacturing operations. Much of our ability to mitigate this impact to date stems from our supply chain strategy, which emphasizes corporate and geographic diversity of supply. In certain situations where we source critical raw materials from a single vendor, we ensure the product can be manufactured in multiple geographies. From a shipping and logistics perspective, the most significant impact to date is the consolidation of shipping routes, which has resulted in constrained capacity. We have factored this into our logistics strategy and are working to mitigate these impacts. Separately, port congestion has recently improved in Europe and the United States although we continue to monitor this risk. Turning to our systems business on slide four Our EPS results were favorably impacted by the successful sale of our 123-megawatt American Kings project. We are pleased with this result, capturing competitive market value for this project despite capital market dislocation. From an EPC perspective, in July, we declared substantial completion on the last remaining project being constructed by First Solar EPC. This project has experienced a combination of unforeseen weather and COVID-19-related delays and incurred significant additional costs during the quarter which then first unfortunately weighed on our Q2 results. Alex will later discuss the P&L impact as well as provide an update on the capital markets for system projects. With regards to our U.S. project development business, as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, the COVID-19 had affected the timing of our evaluation of strategic options for the business. In June, however in collaboration with our financial advisers, we made the determination that the market is now in a better position to evaluate potential partnerships, sales or other transactions. Accordingly in June, we formally launched this process. We do not intend to discuss further developments except to the extent the process is concluded or is otherwise deemed appropriate. With regards to our O&M business, during the third quarter of 2019 earnings call, we indicated that we are evaluating the long-term cost structure competitiveness and risk-adjusted returns of the business. In addition during our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call in February 2020, we discussed that we were continuing to evaluate our O&M strategy to ensure that this business is able to achieve its full enterprise value potential and continued market leadership. Our original entrance into and continued presence in the O&M market was a natural extension of our utility-scale solar development and EPC capabilities. It helped create a vertically integrated systems platform which allowed us to capture an additional profit pool. However, with our transition to a third-party EPC execution model, the increase in the maturity of the U.S. Solar O&M market and our evaluation of strategic opportunities for our U.S. project development business the strategic thesis behind our O&M business has changed. From a financial perspective as we indicated during our December 2017 Analyst Day, our contracted O&M gross margin at the time was above 30% largely as a function of legacy contracts. We also indicated that as we expect the gross margin for new O&M business to decline to a range of 10% to 30% depending on the risk profile and the contract tenure. Relative to this expectation with increased competitive pressure and declining PPA prices, we have seen new contracts trend towards the lower end of this range. While we have been able to partially offset the impact of this gross margin percentage decline by increasing the scale of our O&M portfolio in order to further optimize the business and maintain our market-leading position, we would need to continue increasing the business scale, as well as enhancing the range of O&M product and service offerings. To justify incremental capital investment in O&M, the financial returns would need to exceed those available from further investment in our module business. Earlier this year, we received a compelling unsolicited offer to acquire our North American O&M business from NovaSource Power Services, a portfolio company of Clairvest Group, a strategic investor who is scaling a market leading solar O&M platform following their recent acquisition of Sun Power's utility-scale O&M business. We believe their strategy for scaling and growing the business will enable the O&M enterprise to reach its full potential. Accordingly, this week we signed an agreement to sell our North American O&M business. We believe this transaction captures compelling value will maintain our history of high quality customer service and with additional scale and capital will further enhance the capabilities of the business. Upon closing of this transaction, which is expected by year-end approximately 220 First Solar O&M associates are expected to join NovaSource Solar O&M platform. Turning to slide five. I would like to highlight our bookings and shipment activity for the quarter. In this challenging economic environment, demand for our Series six product remains strong. Since the prior earnings call, our net bookings are 0.8 gigawatts. These new bookings include approximately 0.3 gigawatts of third-party module sales and 0.5 gigawatts of systems bookings. In addition, 0.4 gigawatts of these bookings are for delivery in 2022. Despite our success in booking these additional volumes in the U.S., we believe the current uncertainty of tax equity availability for projects scheduled for completion in 2021 and beyond, as well as the uncertain status of the legislature solution such as the ability to receive direct cash payments in place of direct investment tax credits to alleviate this tax equity availability constraint is a headwind impacting our ability to book certain opportunities in late-stage negotiations. We currently have approximate 0.9 gigawatts of opportunities in late-stage negotiation with terms, pricing and conditions near final agreement. We believe the current uncertain tax equity environment has contributed to the delays in finalizing these negotiations and accordingly has delayed our ability to book these volumes. Note, although not booked these volumes are reflected in our late-stage opportunity pipeline. Strong Series six demand coupled with First Solar strength as a trusted partner underlines our current bookings and late-stage opportunities, which when combined totaled 1.7 gigawatts. During the second quarter, we shipped 1.2 gigawatts, which was approximately 300 megawatts below our expectations. Delays in shipments were due to a combination of previously mentioned port congestion, project site labor constraints, and interconnection and financing delays. After accounting for second quarter shipments, our contracted backlog remained strong with future expected shipments of 11.9 gigawatts. Our ability to forward contract module supply creates a position of strength, which enables pricing discipline and helps to mitigate the financial impact of variable spot pricing for solar modules. We remain effectively sold out through 2020 with only two gigawatts left to sell of our expected 2021 supply with a 21 mid- to late-stage pipeline of 3.8 gigawatts, which includes the previously mentioned 0.9 gigawatts in late-stage negotiations we have a path to fully contract our 2021 supply plan over the next few quarters. With regards to our systems booking in July, we were awarded two PPAs for projects located in Ohio and North Carolina that support the clean energy needs of a Fortune 500 company starting in 2023. Separately, the building of the recent PPA we signed with Dow prior to the first quarter earnings call, we continue to see strong demand from corporate customers who are becoming increasingly proactive in reducing their carbon footprints. As America's solar company, we're proud to support the renewable energy objectives of corporations with our Series six technology, which has the lowest carbon and water footprints available in the market today. As a reflection of this sustainability leadership, we are pleased to announce earlier today our commitment to the RE100 initiative, joining the likes of Apple, Facebook, Kellogg, and Microsoft all customers of clean energy generated by First Solar technology. In joining this initiative, we are targeting powering all of our U.S. operations with 100% renewable energy by 2026 and our global operations by 2028. As shown on slide six, our mid- to late-stage pipeline of opportunities remains robust, and has increased by 0.3 gigawatts despite bookings of 0.8 gigawatts since the prior earnings call. In terms of segment mix, this opportunity pipeline of 7.8 gigawatts includes approximately 7.3 gigawatts of potential module sales with the remaining represent potential systems business opportunities. In terms of geographical breakdown, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 5.9 gigawatts. Europe represents 1.7 gigawatts and the remainder in Asia Pacific. As a reminder, our mid to late-stage pipeline reflects those opportunities the each sales could book within the next 12 months and is a subset of a much larger pipeline of opportunities, which totaled 15 gigawatts of opportunities in 2022 and beyond. Turning to slide seven. I would like to provide an update manufacturing cost and technology outlook. Overall, I'm very pleased with our manufacturing execution especially in light of the current environment. Much of our ability to thus far mitigate the operational impact of COVID-19 stems from our proprietary manufacturing technology, which enabled us to produce a cad tel module within a single factory in a matter of hours. Our fully integrated manufacturing process is a competitive advantage relative to crystalline silicon technology, which is manufactured over the course of several days across multiple sites. While we have largely mitigated supply chain disruptions to date, the impact of the pandemic experienced in other industries underscores the importance of supply chain diversity. As the only U.S. based company and only alternative to crystalline silicon technology among the 10 largest solar module manufacturers globally, First Solar provides a domestic supply security and enables United States and global markets to ensure -- to reduce their overreliance on imported and government subsidized panels from China. As we look to the future, we believe a differentiated technology and advantaged cost structure and a balanced perspective on growth will enable us to continue succeeding in the global marketplace. By the end of 2021, we expect to have eight gigawatts of Series six nameplate capacity across factories in the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam. Note this capacity is over 120% higher than the original nameplate envisioned when we launched Series six. As we evaluate the potential for future capacity expansions, we may seek to further diversify our manufacturing presence, although we have made no decisions at this time. Several factors in this evaluation include : firstly, geographic proximity to solar demand where First Solar has an energy or competitive advantage and which could mitigate freight-related costs; secondly the ability to export cost competitively to other markets. Thirdly, cost-competitive labor low energy cost and low real estate cost. And finally, a cost-competitive supply chain to support the sourcing of raw materials and components. From a cost perspective, we previously indicated during our December 2017 Analyst Day that we expect to reduce our 2020 lead line cost per watt by 40% relative to the Series four 2016 cost per watt. We have achieved this target at our Vietnam manufacturing sites and on track to do so in Malaysia by the end of the year. Our Series six factory in Vietnam, which to date has been largely unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic are a strong leading indicator for the full potential of the entire manufacturing fleet. Secondly, we indicated that despite an increase in the proportion of module volume coming from our higher-cost Ohio factories relative to where we ended up in 2019, we expect our fleet-wide cost per watt to decline approximately 10% over the year. Despite the unforeseen challenges posed by the pandemic, we remain on track to achieve this objective. We continue to believe, there is significant headroom and further enhance our competitiveness in our Series six technology and we relentlessly challenge ourselves on commercializing the next-generation of disruptive thin film technology. Simply put, we continually strive to accelerate our pace of innovation in pursuit of our near- and mid-term technology objectives. In the near term, we are focused on successfully implementing our copper replacement program in our lead line during the second half of 2021 and fleet-wide during 2022. This implementation is expected to further increase the Series six energy advantage due to increased wattage, significantly reduce long-term degradation and improve temperature coefficient. Each of these improvements is expected to create value for our customers, which will facilitate Series six bookings in 2022 and 2023 with the module bins increasing from 460 watts to 480 watts over this period. Of note in July, we produced the first copper replaced Series six modules, which will be utilized to initial -- for initial preliminary testing and validation. While we remain largely on track for our implementation, COVID-19 and technical challenges remain as a risk to the project completion time line. In the mid-term, we remain focused on achieving our goal of a 500-watt module, which is at a standard test condition glass area efficiency of 20.8%. This technology enhancement will further increase the customer value proposition and cost competitiveness of Series 6. It is important to note, unlike recently announced increases in crystalline silicon wattage made possible through module size increases. The planned Series six wattage increase is expected to be driven by a 15% increase in energy density without changing our module form factor. In other words, we do not see increasing our customers balance the system or design costs in order to achieve the 500-watt goal. Additionally, the benefits of improved temperature coefficient and significantly reduced long-term degradation, coupled with our continued spectral response advantage, will amplify the benefits of increased energy density and are expected to increase life cycle energy beyond 15% without adding cost to the module device. As shown on slide eight, in support of our near, mid and long-term goals, we have recently announced a series of changes in our technology and manufacturing senior leadership. Firstly, Markus Gloeckler has been appointed Co-Chief Technology Officer alongside Raffi Garabedian, our CTO since 2012 and will join First Solar's executive leadership team. Markus will drive our Series six platform device and efficiency improvement road map. This will enable Raffi to focus on advanced research and development to create the next disruptive cad tel technology beyond Series six. A particular area of focus will be to evaluate moving beyond a single junction device and leverage the high-band gap advantage of cad tel into a multi-junction device. The objective would be to create a market-leading high-efficiency technology that remains energy advantage. Secondly, as recently announced Tymen deJong, our Chief Operating Officer has decided to retire effective April 2021. Tymen has played an essential role in establishing the company's international Series six module manufacturing footprint, with five announced factories currently in production and a six on track to commence production during the first quarter of 2021. I'm appreciative of Tymen's invaluable leadership and his many significant contributions to First Solar over the years. Tymen will continue to serve as COO during his eight-month transition period overseeing certain priority projects. In addition, during this transition Tymen will transfer the majority of his responsibilities to Mike Koralewski, Chief Manufacturing Officer; Kuntal Kumar Verma, Chief Manufacturing Engineering Officer; and Pat Buehler, Chief Quality and Reliability Officer; each of whom will join First Solar's executive leadership team. We believe the addition of Markus, Mike, Kuntal and Pat to the executive leadership team will enhance our manufacturing technical and commercial capabilities and set the company up for continued growth. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our second quarter financial results and outlook for 2020. Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Starting on slide nine, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the second quarter. Net sales in Q2 were $642 million, an increase of $110 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the sale of the American Kings project, partially offset by lower module sale volumes. On a segment basis, as a percentage of total quarterly net sales, our module segment revenue in Q2 was 58% compared to 74% in Q1. Total gross margin was 21% in Q2 compared to 17% in Q1. The systems segment gross margin was 21% in Q2 compared to 11% in Q1 and the increase was primarily driven by increased U.S. project sales and higher seasonal production from our power generating assets. This was partially offset by $22 million of cost increases stemming from unforeseen weather issues, COVID-19-related delays and other matters related to our final EPC project mentioned by Mark earlier. And we intend to pursue recovery of these costs by insurance and other forms of relief. The module segment gross margin was 22% in Q2 compared to 19% in Q1. This increase was driven by a lower cost per watt sold, despite the higher mix of volume from our Ohio factories and a slight increase in ASPs compared to Q1. While our total module segment gross margin for the quarter was adversely impacted by $13 million of Series four-related charges, primarily due to severance, decommissioning and costs associated with reduced manufacturing volumes. Our Series six gross margin was approximately 25% in Q2. This included $3 million of COVID-19-related costs, which reduced our Series six gross margin by approximately 1%. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $74 million in the second quarter, a decrease of approximately $10 million compared to the prior quarter. Of note, the second quarter total includes $3 million of severance costs, $3 million of impairment charges related to development projects and $1 million of retention compensation. Start-up expense was $6 million in Q2 compared to $4 million in Q1. In relation to litigation matters, as initially slated on June 3, we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the claims and the opt-out actions of $19 million, resulting in a $6 million litigation loss during the second quarter. We've since entered into a definitive settlement agreement. And while we were confident in the fact that merits our position, we believe it was in our best interest to conclude this lengthy litigation process and continue our focus on driving the business forward. Separately, the previously disclosed class action settlement agreement received final approval from and was dismissed with prejudice by the court at the end of the second quarter. By entering into the definitive settlement agreement for the opt-out and the class action settlement dismissed with prejudice, the final securities litigation is behind us. Including start-up and litigation losses, total operating expenses were $87 million in the second quarter, reduction of approximately $2 million compared to the first quarter. Interest income was $4 million in the second quarter, compared to $9 million in Q1. This is primarily driven by decline in interest rates which led to a reduction in the yield on our cash and time deposits. We recorded tax expense of $10 million in the second quarter compared to a tax benefit of $89 million in the first quarter. The increase in tax expense for Q2 is attributable to the discrete tax benefit recognized in Q1, as a result of the CARES Act and higher pretax earnings in Q2. The aforementioned combination of items led to a second quarter earnings per share of $0.35 compared to earnings per share at $0.85 during the first quarter. Next turning to slide 10. I'll discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $44 million compared to the prior quarter. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $465 million, a decrease from $472 million at the end of Q1. And as a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding project is sold. Our net cash position which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, increased by approximately $51 million to $1.2 billion. The increase in our net cash balance is primarily related to cash collections on systems projects in the U.S. and operating cash flows from our module segment. This was partially offset by capital expenditures and other working capital changes during the second quarter. Net working capital in Q2, which includes non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $76 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of project assets, a decrease in accounts receivable related to our last remaining in-house EPC project and an increase in current liabilities, which includes accrued litigation losses. Net cash provided by operating activities was $148 million in the second quarter, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $505 million in the prior quarter. Finally, capital expenses were $108 million in the second quarter, which brings our year-to-date total to $221 million, as we continue our Series six capacity expansion. Turning to slide 11, I'll next provide an updated perspective on 2020 guidance. As discussed during the May earnings call, we withdrew our full year 2020 guidance that's been provided in February, due to the significant uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a follow-up to that decision, I'd like to discuss how each of those uncertainties has evolved. Firstly, the number, intensity and trajectory of COVID-19 cases, has differed across the globe. For example, Vietnam has been relatively fortunate in experiencing national confirmed cases below 1,000. In contrast, the State of Arizona where First Solar's headquarters, has now reached over 180,000 confirmed cases. The outlook for the spread of individual exposure to the pandemic and the related impact on businesses and the economy in general remains very uncertain. Secondly, since the previous earnings call, local, state and national governments have begun easing certain COVID-19-related restrictions. While we've been committed to operate Series six manufacturing in Ohio, Malaysia and Vietnam throughout the pandemic, increases in COVID-19 cases have caused some authorities to reimpose certain restriction and they may continue to do so or even significantly expand those restrictions. Thirdly, to-date we have not experienced any significant operational impact to our manufacturing supply chain, although we continue to monitor this risk. From a logistics perspective, port congestion has recently improved in Europe and the United States. However, the most significant impact state remains the consolidation of shipping routes, which has resulted in constrained capacity. We've incorporated this into our logistics strategy, but to the extent ports are severely congested or are temporarily shut down, our ability to ship modules and receive inbound raw materials may be adversely impacted. Fourthly, tax equity and debt markets appear intact for high-quality 2020 projects, as demonstrated by our ability to complete the sale of our American Kings project during the quarter. However, tax equity commitments for project set to achieve a commercial operation in 2021 appear uncertain. COVID-19 has caused a number of prominent financial institutions to book record allowances for credit losses during the second quarter, sighting a significant uncertainty around the path of recovery. This reduction in profitability may reduce the availability of 2021 tax equity capacity, or negatively impact its pricing and terms. Our Sun Streams two project which has not been sold, has an expected completion date in 2021 and will require a tax equity investment during this time frame to be efficiently monetized. We expect visibility into the 2021 tax equity market to continue to improve. However, to the extent the tax equity market remains dislocated, we remain strongly supportive of a direct pay legislative solution in place for investment tax credits, to alleviate the structural market constraints. Importantly, legislative solutions such as the aforementioned direct cash payment could help mitigate the adverse impact of financing delays resulting from reduced tax equity availability for our third-party module customers. Internationally, the rates to our Japan assets, while we made progress as it relates to the sale processes, completing financing, construction and executing asset sales is challenging in this environment. We're continuing to work with relevant counterparties to facilitate the timely success of these project sales. Given the significant uncertainties that remain associated with the pandemic and its effect, we feel it's prudent to continue providing the guidance metrics that we believe are largely within our control or within reasonable line of sight at this time. With these factors in mind our 2020 guidance is as follows. Our full year 2020 production guidance of 5.7 gigawatts of Series six and 0.3 gigawatts of Series four remains unchanged. We have already achieved our Series four production target. And year-to-date we have produced approximately 3.3 gigawatts of Series six. Now we do not anticipate any further ramp costs in 2020 above the $4 million recorded during the first quarter. Our operating expenses forecast, which includes production start-up expense has increased by $5 million to a revised range of $345 million to $365 million. While our production start-up expense guidance has decreased by $5 million to a revised range of $45 million to $55 million, this benefit was offset by the previously mentioned $6 million litigation losses and $3 million of impairment charges related to development projects. Additionally, depending on the timing of previously expected IT cost savings during the year we may track to the higher end of our operating expense guidance range. Finally, our 2020 Series 6 manufacturing CapEx forecast of $450 million to $550 million remains unchanged. As it relates to our module segment, we anticipate sequential improvement in gross margin percentage during the third and fourth quarters. The factors driving this improvement are : firstly, a declining cost per watt, as we've largely ramped manufacturing our second Ohio factory; secondly, limited revenue recognition from Series 4 during the second half of the year; and finally, limited incremental severance costs expected during the second half of the year. While we achieved a 25% Series 6 gross margin in the second quarter, we expect a relatively flat Series 6 gross margin in the third quarter to a modest decline in ASPs offset by a reduction in cost per watt. While we expect a flat Series 6 gross margin in the third quarter, we anticipate an increase in overall module segment gross margin percentage due to declining Series 4 volumes. In the fourth quarter, we expect Series 6 gross margin expansion of approximately 300 basis points due to a lower cost per watt, increased volume sold and a more favorable plant mix. As we do not anticipate to recognize any Series 4 revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect our Series 6 gross margin will represent overall module segment gross margin. Of note, with shipments of approximately 2.5 gigawatts during the first half of the year, our expected shipments profile is incrementally back-weighted to the third and fourth quarters. As we continue to work with our module customers to mitigate impacts from the current pandemic, there remains potential for the timing of module shipments to move across quarters or over year-end with a corresponding impact to revenue and gross margins. Our $1.2 billion net cash position increased by $51 million in the previous quarter. This liquidity position remains a strategic differentiator, which enables us to make proactive and strategic investments in technology cost and product leadership during the current market disruption and in the long-term. We intend to maintain the strong liquidity position throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And at this time, we do not expect to draw on our revolving credit facility. Turning to slide 12, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Firstly, we had Q2 earnings per share of $0.35 and increased our quarter end net cash position. Secondly, we achieved fleet-wide capacity utilization over 100% during May, June and July and have achieved our mid-term cost per watt target of 40% reduction below our 2016 Series 4 costs at our Vietnam factories. Thirdly, demand for our Series 6 technology remains strong and we have continued success adding to our contracted pipeline with net bookings of 0.8 gigawatts since the prior earnings call and 2.6 gigawatts year-to-date. With a contracted backlog of 11.9 gigawatts, we remain effectively sold out through 2020 and have two gigawatts remaining to sell of our expected 2021 supply. Despite challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we're pleased with our operational and financial performance, achieving results in line with our pre-COVID expectations. And finally, while the significant uncertainty posed by the current pandemic remains, we are updating the guidance provided on our May earnings call, which includes full year 2020 production guidance of approximately 5.9 gigawatts, full year 2020 capital expenditure guidance of $450 million to $550 million, and full year 2020 operating expense guidance of $345 million to $365 million, which includes $45 million to $55 million of start-up expenses. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. For the bookings, you've secured since last earnings call, can you share how much is for delivery in 2021 versus two and three? And what are the ASPs for the bookings? I think last quarter you mentioned pricing for 2022 and 2023 was still good in the 30s. And I think you mentioned in the deck that it's still attractive. So I was wondering if you're seeing some pressure perhaps in the outer years. Or if you're still able to maintain? And then also as you think about the bookings in 2022 and 2023 and your cost road map, what are your expectations for margins? It's a ways out I know, but wanted to just get a sense for -- if you expect margins to remain stable in that time frame or perhaps potentially step down with the Section 201 expiring? Or potentially even see some upside in margins? Mark Widmar : Yes. I'll take the bookings ASP and I'll let Alex handle the margin question. So in terms of the bookings between earnings calls, which is basically 0.8 gigawatts, 400 or so of that was with our systems business which is would be for shipments in 2022, and then the rest effectively is 2021. But what I would expand beyond that, Phil, and we tried to highlight in the call we have about 900 megawatts that sits in effectively final stage negotiations. In some cases, ready to sign a PO. In some cases, subject to some CP. In some cases, a letter of intent with exclusivity locking in the module volume and the module pricing. So against that 900, we've had agreed pricing on all that. It's just -- again, with the uncertainty and these are all 2021 shipments, with the uncertainty of the availability of tax equity, with the uncertainty with any type of legislative fixed direct pay type of structure, people are being a little concerned around locking in firm contracts and leaving certain -- some on the CPs open to allow them enough time to assure financings in place and the like associated with the project. These are projects that are committed. These are projects that have PPAs, their sites, they're ready to go. They're just finalizing some of the financing components to ensure they have everything locked and loaded around the project. If you include those projects, those projects also have pre-annual ASPs. So if you look at the volume that we have for module only, it's up 300 or so, 400 or so for 2021 plus that additional 900. They all are still very solid ASPs. We are in advantage situation from the standpoint as we said. We only have about 2 gigawatts left to book. Our customers know that. There are biases and preferences to do business with First Solar and certainty of supply and ability to deliver. And so we have customers engaging with us proactively, so we can lock up that supply. So if I lock up that 900 right now late-stage negotiations, I only have about one gigawatt left for 2021. And our customers want to ensure that security and get that in place for that supply. So my ASPs are still holding reasonably firm. We're happy with the ASPs. Behind those -- there's two more follow-up orders that almost get to one gigawatt that are associated with that 900 that are in late-stage negotiations with two separate customers. They have follow-on commitments they would like to make in 2022. So I can give you a feel of where that pricing is right now. It's in line with what we said in the last call. We had a large order which had carried volumes into 2022. It did have a two handle. It was in the high twos. It also had adjusters for bins. It had adjusters for module degradation, if we do better than we had guided to. So I look at what we have for last quarter that was booked plus what we currently are engaged in the market with around pricing in 2022. We're still pretty happy with how that's shaping up. A lot of things can move and change. Clearly, there's got to be some solution to tax equity and capacity, because that's going to constrain the market could have adverse implication around projects. But at least from a bookings and relative ASPs, we're pretty happy -- given the challenges in the current environment pretty happy with what we're seeing. Alex Bradley : Yes. So on the cost side on the margin side, a long way out as you said to be giving you guidance around gross margin. But if you try and think around the cost piece at the beginning of the year, we said we were looking at a 10% reduction in cost over 2019 to 2020 year-end to year-end and we said we're on track to do that. We also said that we expected by year-end to achieve the Series 4 minus 40% cost reduction target we initially stated back 2017 at our high-volume manufacturing. So we've actually already achieved that by midyear at our Vietnam factory. We're tracking well to do that in Malaysia as well. And remember, that number includes freight warranty as well when you're doing a comparison around those numbers. So cost reduction going pretty well so far. And then if you go back to the slide we showed in our guidance call back in February, we gave you a chart that showed a lot of levers around cost reduction. A key one is our CuRe program which is going to be increasing wattage and Mark in prepared remarks he talked about bringing it out from 460 to 480 in that '22 '23 time frame. And we're doing that with a module that's a same size. We're actually getting increased energy density versus some of what you're seeing in our competitors today who are announcing very large nameplate watt numbers, but actually on an efficiency basis seeing almost no improvement. It's just a significantly larger module. So our CuRe is really important to getting us there. CuRe is important for nameplate wattage also improves degradation overall energy profile. So when we look through that, we think that helps us bring cost down, but also negate some of the bifacial threat that we've seen, but that's only a couple of the levers. And if you look through that same chart I mentioned, we talked about yield throughput efficiency bill of material sales rate. And if you do the math on the chart there we gave, it's still directionally accurate. You get to a point where we can bring costs down significantly over the next few years. So I can't guide you to gross margin percent at this point. But given what Mark said around was -- where we're seeing ASPs and we're comfortable with those. We're tracking towards the cost reductions that we discussed earlier in the year. I'm comfortable where we are seeing gross margins coming out on those longer-dated bookings. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first one on the gross margins. The sequential improvement for Series six not to get to sort of nickel and dime in here, but is the baseline 25% that you reported this quarter which includes the $3 million of COVID-related costs, are you assuming those costs come off in the back half? And so it's a 300 basis point expansion in Q4 over a clean 26% baseline? And then I guess related to that, are there any more ramp costs embedded in COGS in Q3 and Q4 that further go away in '21? Alex Bradley : So as of now there's no ramp costs in Q3, Q4. The only ramp that we saw is $4 million in Q1 and that's the full expected ramp for the year. In terms of the expansion, it's still unknown. I mean, the number we're giving you here assumes we may still have some COVID-related costs impacting us in Q3 and Q4. So I think you can look at it really as a 300 improvement from the 25 as a starting point. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Can you hear me right? Alex Bradley : Sure. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Great. You mentioned that Raffi is going to be working on advanced research and development to create the next disruptive technologies beyond Series 6. Is there some preview of that you could talk about at this time? And are there limits to the levels of efficiency that you can get out of the technology? Mark Widmar : There's lots of headroom still to go on the efficiency side in the entitlement around our cad tel device. Raffi I suppose you may not remember or aware of. Raffi joined the company decade or so ago. He really joined us as part of our advanced research team and he at that time was leading our efforts to evaluate alternatives to infill material such as CIGS. So his core competencies around understanding really all of the semiconductor devices in PV in particular whether it's crystalline silicon, whether it's Perovskites, whether it's cad tel, whether it's CIGS all different devices. Raffi has got a deep knowledge and understanding on. So when we look beyond the current device in Series 6, one of the things that we are looking to is -- one of the inherent advantages that we have with cad tel is that from -- it has a very high-band gap, which means that it captures a significant amount of the sun spectrum the light -- sun spectrum light. And there's a lot of evolution that could happen with devices or technology and there's some that's being done in aerospace where you create a single junction or to a multi-junction type of technology whether it could be a combination of different types of technologies two different types of thin films maybe even -- could be thin films with crystalline silicon as an alternative. So one of the things that Raffi is going to be looking at is not only existing materials there could be organic PV that he would be looking at as well different solutions that are evolving Perovskites could be looking beyond just a single junction into a multi-junction type of device. So it's really just evaluating the world and the spectrum, which they are possible and then how do we leverage what we currently have and evolve that beyond what our current capabilities are around the technology. So that's primarily what Raffi is going to be focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Hey, guys. Following on previous question from and analyst, just about costs ramp costs anything associated with Series 4 ramp down? And then number two, how do you sell your O&M business, but then your development business, how do you sell that first before development business just in the market? And then number three, just looking at your exit rate for saying that you have two gigawatts to sell in 2021, what does that assume for your total production because I think it's higher than your nameplate? Mark Widmar : So the first -- I'll take the O&M question and then the -- in terms of the 2 gigawatts or 21 relative to what the assumption is for the supply plan. And then Alex can talk about kind of ramp costs in general and then also decommissioning costs related to Series 4. Ben, look on the O&M business, especially now that we no longer have the EPC capability we'll move to a third party. We've kind of separated the development business from the O&M business. And the reason I say that is that a lot of the EPC providers that we engage with also want to provide O&M. So now we created kind of a competitive tension around captive development with maintaining the O&M even though we're using a third party to do the EPC. The EPC wants to somewhat -- they have guarantees and other warranties that they provide post COD and they also -- a number of them would prefer to do O&M for that horizon. And some want to do it strategically longer term. So for us because the separation of EPC from the development business has created this natural separation between development and O&M. So it's not as unnatural as it may appear. It's maybe unnatural from how we first evolved. As we said there's -- the capabilities and the cycles of innovation that's evolved in the O&M space today is much different than the journey first started off and if you have those full capabilities. So it's kind of separated through that for that reason. And as we look at strategic options for the systems business even if we end up partnering or doing something different retaining the interest in the development business, it's not as critical to have the O&M capability as it was years ago. And to some extent what we prefer to even do today is just do the development get a cycle -- site excuse, me to notice to proceed, staple that with a module agreement and then step out of the equation. I really don't want to deal with the third-party EPC. I just want to -- where we create the greatest amount of value turning keys over to third-party EPC and sell down into a long-term owner. So that's the process around O&M and how we can separate it. The 2 gigawatts of 2021 we'll have nameplate capacity in 2021 of 8 gigawatts. Our supply plan right now is about 7.5 gig. I think we indicated in prior communication that we view between 7.3 and 7.7. So it's -- the midpoint is 7.5. That's kind of what we're tracking to right now. So two gigawatts left to go out of 7.5. So we've got 5.5 booked. I got almost half of that 2 gigawatts in late-stage negotiations with negotiated pricing finalizing terms and conditions. So we have a pretty good line of sight to make sure we can sell-through that 2021 pipeline. Alex Bradley : Yes. And Ben, on the ramp side on the ramp up, as I mentioned before, $4 million of ramp up costs for the year fully taken in Q1 than were expected. And in terms of ramp down costs the majority of those ramp down costs hit in Q1 and Q2. We'll see a few single-digit million still come through in terms of true decommissioning costs and a little bit of ongoing severance and retention but the vast majority of that cost has been taken in the first half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Lee with Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: It's Julien here. Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Appreciate it. Just wanted to follow-up here on -- first off, if you can talk about some of the backdrop here for systems business? You guys talked about pressure on that probably trending towards the lower end. Can you elaborate on what's driving that? If I'm hearing you right, you're specifically alluding to tax equity but I just want to understand what's driving that today and what your expectations are with respect to that evolving over time?  And then secondly if we can come back to the bookings trajectory, near term but more importantly longer term, how do you think about signing into 2022 and 2023 given the potential for further tax credit extensions et cetera? Just want to understand is there still pressure to sign into those last couple of years of 30% ITC the way it's structured now? Alex Bradley : Julien just to clarify on your first question you said lower end of systems. Can you just clarify what you mean by that? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just give some margin pressure on the systems business maybe more broadly as you described in your opening comments? Mark Widmar : Yes. Well first I will and then you can take maybe a little bit on that too. But I think what we said just so we're maybe clear is we did reference the O&M business that we gave a range of gross margin expectations that we previously had established for O&M and the -- now range was 10% to 30% when we based our Analyst Day in 2017. We indicated that what we've seen in the market is that the actual gross margins on the O&M business have trended towards the lower end. And this combination two things increased competition plus lower PPA prices. So PPA prices have continued to come down. And really in order to drive to a lower LCOE everything whether it's the module, the inverter, the O&M, operating expenses whatever it is all have been kind of under pressure. And so that was the comment I think we referenced towards the lower end of the range around O&M and we are seeing that come down part of the pressure because of lower PPA prices. Look I think the tax equity and the implications that it has availability is going to be a challenge. So it's going to be mainly available for high-quality projects plus because it's a constraint I would expect pricing to actually increase which actually works against the PPA prices and potentially would require higher PPA prices in order to create market-clearing prices. But I'll let Alex talk more about tax equity and what we're seeing in that regard. Alex Bradley : Yes. Just one comment on the O&M for the tax equities. I think you've seen margins come down and that's been also commensurate with a risk profile decrease. So if you look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, I think it's still value in that business. But overall, gross margins have come down as owners have started to keep more risk on their side of the ledger. When it comes to tax equity, I think what we're seeing, as we mentioned before in the script, capacity levels for 2020 deals. And that's partly a function of banks firming up their views on capacity for the year and partly a function of them are projects pushing out to the right, which is pretty natural in any given year. I think what we're seeing in the current market though is that the major players who lead transactions, when you look at 2021, they either have already booked out of their capacity or they're just very uncertain around the early stand. So a lot of those major players have taken loan loss reserves so far in 2021, those are accounting reserves today. I think you may start to even crystallize into actual losses in 2021 and there's uncertainty around that. When you combine that with existing commitments that they've made and then also at this time of the year you typically tend to get constraints in human resources as the banks focus on closing out deals that have to be done by the end of the year. What we're seeing is there isn't really committed capital available for next year. On top of that I think the syndication market has become constrained. So the players who don't normally, lead deals that have participation in pieces and then smaller overcapacity have also got a lot of uncertainty. So that market's dried out. And put more pressure on the lead players. And what that means for us from a value perspective, when you think about Sun Streams 2, like other large high-quality projects from experienced developers I think, tax equity will ultimately be available for that project. But it may not be -- and we may be able to get committed capital until late this year early next year which will delay the timing of the sale if that happens. And as Mark said, you could see impact on pricing and/or other terms which can also impact value. And so I think, that's one of the constraints for us. And then from our perspective obviously, we sell modules to customers who also rely on having tax equity to have their projects move ahead. And if we see, significant dislocation in the market that could be the difference between those projects moving ahead on schedule being delayed or ultimately even being cancelled. So those impact to us there on the module side of the business as well. And overall that's why when we look at it we believe a legislative solution here is the best way to deal with a constraint. Unfortunately if you look at the current draft of the Republican proposal, put out last week it doesn't address this tax equity issue. But there's a long way to go before that bill becomes law. And so our hope is that that provision will be addressed through negotiation and bill reconciliation. Mark Widmar : Yes. I think the other question you had Julien was around volumes in 2022 and 2023. And how do we think about, booking that volume up relative to a potential extension of the ITC, as an example. Between 2022 and 2023, I think where we sit right now, a little bit north of three gigawatts or so that is booked in that window. We got another about one, gigawatts that's in late negotiations as well, that's got committed pricing around it. And that's -- so call it four gigawatts that we've got a stake in the ground for -- during that window. That's against about 16 or so gigawatts of supply that we'll have over that period of time. So maybe we're 1/4 of that somewhat committed to or locked into either booked or with commitment around pricing. It's pretty -- we still have room to go. And really we still will be very patient in that window. We'll look for good pricing. So knowing where our cost curve is going to go and where we can capture the best pricing. Play to our strengths like, we always do hot human requirements. Texas being another area that we talked to -- talked before about given cell cracking issues and inability of some of our competitors to get projects underwritten by insurance carriers or just the general cost of insurance being significantly higher. So there are a number of things that we do in the U.S. that play to our strengths, evolving that with our new technology with our copper replacement product. And if we can capture good value for the technology start securing up some of that volumes in that window, clearly we'll do that. But when I think about four gigawatts relative to the supply of 16, I got lots of optionality still left that if there is an extension on the ITC that creates an additional peak in the curve. And potential more stable and better pricing environment we still have to take advantage of that as well. Operator : Our final question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Colin Rusch : Hi. Thanks so much, guys. Are you seeing the impact of lower cost capital start to creep into any of the PPA bids and some of the project economics at this point? Are you seeing PPA prices come down at all? Are you seeing a little bit of give in some of the project-level economics since you're talking to customers? Mark Widmar : Yes. What I would say is, it's -- I guess, you stay core and you stay true to what you do and you try to create value. And where you can differentiate yourself that's where you engage. And so if I look at the PPA price that we have for what we just cleared with a large Fortune 500 customer, the terms condition structure the price is a premium relative to what I think you're seeing in the market right now. And part of that just being is the particular counterparty wanted to do business with, First Solar. They loved our sustainability approach. It becomes kind of our full life cycle management of our product inception to final recycling. And how we engage from that standpoint, and how we think about our CO2 footprint, our water usage, it just spreaded so nicely in what they want. And that's core to them as well. And so those things put us in a position to capture better value. And it's no different than I've got a large opportunity with a particular customer, that's looking to cure over one gigawatts of volume over the next several years. And they want to do business with an American company right? They love the fact that we have R&D and manufacturing in the U.S. and they're not worried about the lowest possible module price in that example right? We create value through our technology, through our capabilities. And they're willing to partner with us in that regard. And they're looking for a true partner. So we try to stay disciplined in that regard. As it relates to -- are they -- yes the -- on the debt side is that somewhat being positively impacting where people could think through clearing of PPAs or underlying assumptions around that? You have that, but you still have this uncertainty in the U.S. around tax equity, I would argue they kind of offset themselves. And spreads may be moving a little bit as well. And you'll probably get back to the same position that you were in to start from. So I don't think we've seen a real inflection point yet, as it relate to cost of capital driving further lower PPA prices. Operator : This ends our time for the question-and-answer session. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2020 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2020. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by thanking the First Solar team for delivering a solid third quarter. Our operational financial results were strong, and market demand for our Series 6 technology continues to be robust. We had a number of highlights since our last earnings call, including record Series 6 quarterly production of 1.5 gigawatt, solid bookings of 1.6 gigawatt, commercial production of 445 watt module, and earnings per share of $1.45 bringing year-to-date earnings to $2.65. Our Q3 financial results were driven by a modest second gross margin increase, as well as sales assistance projects. While significant uncertainty remain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are pleased with our year-to-date performance. As a result of the improved visibility provided by the closing a certain systems project sales. We are reinstating financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020. Alex will discuss our financial performance and guidance in greater detail. Turning to slide 3, I'll first discuss our Module segment performance. Year-to-date, we have produced 4.9 gigawatts, including 4.7 gigawatts of Series 6, with each factory averaging over 100% capacity utilization during the third quarter. Throughput was led by our international factories, which averaged 118% and 119% capacity utilization, September and October month to date. Domestically, our Ohio one and Ohio two factories are performing well, averaging 109% and 121% over the same periods.  On a fleet wide basis in September and October month to date, megawatts produced per day were 16.9 and 17.9. Manufacturing yield was 96.6% and 97.2%. Average watts per module were 436 and 438 watts. And the ARC bin distribution from 435 to 445 watt modules was 92% and 96%. At the time of our third quarter 2019 earnings call, we had recently validated a new world record 447 Cad tel modules. Building on this, we have implemented these learnings and started commercial production of a 445 watt module. Continuing this momentum over the next few quarters, we expect our top bin to increase further to 455 watts. In September and October month to date, our Vietnam factories achieved a manufacturing yield of 98%. We continue to implement the learnings and best practices across the fleet with a fleet wide yield target of 98% for our current manufacturing footprint by the end of 2021. In the future, we see the potential to incrementally improve the obvious target. As noted previously, continued throughput, module watts and manufacturing yield improvements will help drive down our module costs per watt. Since the previous earnings call, we have not experienced significant disruption to our manufacturing operation from the pandemic. Much of our ability to mitigate the potential impact stems from our vertically integrated manufacturing process, diversified supply chain and differentiated Cad tel technology. By contrast, the largest PV model manufacturers globally produced crystalline silicon modules using a batch process technology with multiple process steps. None of these manufacturers are fully vertically integrated and realized to varying degrees on third party sourcing of poly silicon, ingots, wafers themselves. Productions of a single crystalline silicon module acquires each of these process steps several factories in multiple days. During the third quarter, several poly silicon produces experienced significant disruptions that hindered their ability to maintain manufacturing operations. This disruption coupled with a supply chain largely concentrated among a few Chinese companies reduces the available supply of poly silicon. The poly silicon price increase that follows resulted in downstream pricing pressures for wafer cells and modules, and consequently, for project developers. While the market for poly silicon has since improved, these events highlight the benefits of our vertically integrated manufacturing process, which enables price and delivery time certainty for customer orders within our contracted backlog. From a shipping and logistics perspective, the most significant impact to date remains the challenging global freight market. While limited freight capacity has increased spot rates, our logistics strategy which primarily relies on foreign shipping contracts has out reduced its impact. Regarding our capacity roadmap, we have received the major equipment required to commence commercial production at our 6 Series six factory in Malaysia. However, as highlighted during our second quarter earnings call, third party equipment vendors, as well as our US base associates are needed on site for tool installation. Currently, all non citizens traveling to Malaysia must have explicit written permission from the Malaysian authorities prior to arrival and are subject to mandatory 14-day quarantine period. While several vendors have received the necessary travel approvals, we're continuing to cooperate with the relevant agencies to gain approval for the remaining travel in a safe and timely matter. Delays in the approval process and compliance with required isolation procedures have the potential to impact the timing of commercial production and consequently, our full year 2021 production plan. Despite this uncertainty, we continue to evaluate opportunities across our existing manufacturing footprint to further increase our production and capacity entitlement.  Touching on the System segment, our EPS results have favorably impacted by the sale of three projects in Japan and to in India. For the sale of our American Kings project in Q2, the Japan and India sales in Q3 and with a potential sale of the Sun Streams 2 project in Q4, 2020. We have a viable path to close each project sale contemplated in our original 2020 guidance from February. Starting to slide 4, I'd like to highlight the bookings and shipping activity for the quarter. In September, we were awarded the PPA for 180 megawatt AC solar project, with the option for future energy storage located in Arkansas. This project will support the clean energy needs of three General Motors facilities in the Midwest, starting in 2023. Building off of this, and the recent PPAs we assigned with Reagan and Dow, we are witnessing leading corporations taking bold steps to reduce their environmental footprint and doing so supported by technology developed and manufactured in the United States. As the only US headquartered company among the 10 largest PV module manufacturers globally, with a differentiated catch up technology using the lowest carbon footprint and water usage and a leading PV module recycling program that recovers 90% or more of the glass metals and Cad tel semiconductor materials. We are well positioned to address this market need. Additionally, it has been an active quarter for our systems business in Japan, as we continued success adding to our contracted backlog with the addition of two projects totaling approximately 80 megawatts. From the third party module sales perspective, 36 demands has been robust, among other bookings, as announced last week, we secured a 0.9 gigawatt of volume from this to energy for deliveries scheduled in 2021 and 2022. As part of this deal, our Series 6 technology will support six privates in Texas, a region that leverages our temperature coefficient, spectral response, and durability and quality advantages. As a US solar technology provider, we are proud to play a supporting role and district's commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. As highlighted during our Q2 earnings call, we've had a significant volume of 2021 opportunities that were in late stage negotiations, but were delayed due to uncertainty and a tax equity market. While, Alex will provide a more detailed tax equity market update. I would like to note that visibility into 2021 tax capacity has modestly improved. And we secure 0.5 gigawatts of 2021 opportunities since the previous earnings call. Additionally, demand in 2022 and 2023 has been strong, with 0.9 gigawatts of bookings since the previous earnings call. As a result of the recent systems and third party module wins net bookings since the previous earnings call totaled 1.6 gigawatts across 1.5 gigawatts of third party modules and 41 gigawatts systems bookings. Additionally, while not yet meeting all the requirements of a booking we have contracted 0.6 gigawatts subject to conditions precedent for expected deliveries in 2021 and 2023. So the project associated with General Motors PPA has been sold in conjunction with a model purchase order and has been recognized as third party module booking. Included these most recent bookings, we have 6.7 gigawatts go for deliveries in 2021 and 3.6 gigawatts booked for deliveries across 2022 and 2023. In Q3, we shipped 1.2 gigawatts, resulting in year-to-date shipments through the end of the third quarter 3.7 gigawatts. As mentioned during our Q1 earnings call in May, our shipping profile has been back weighted to the second half of the year. Despite this profile, our year-to-date shipments including the third quarter had been below our expectations from the start of the year, largely due to the combination for COVID-19 driven customer project and financing delays. Before delving into the specifics of our pipeline of bookings opportunities, it is important to highlight that some of the trends we are seeing, including the impact of COVID-19 on the near and long term growth of solar installations globally. In the United States, the EIA forecasts that approximately 14 gigawatts of utility scale solar capacity will be added in 2020. This strong demand is led by several states including Texas, California, North Carolina, Nevada, and Virginia. Each was near term development pipelines exceeding one gigawatt. The continued growth of utility scale solar despite the pandemic related headwinds face to the relative health of the US market. Internationally, the impacts of the pandemic have varied by market. While China remains the world's largest solar market, and installed capacity expect it to increase year-over-year. It is seen project completion timelines slipped due to the pandemic. Despite these challenges, the country's 14 five year plan scheduled to be launched in 2021 is expected to call for targets of at least 60 gigawatts per year of installed PV capacity, or approximately 300 gigawatts over the duration of the plan. In Europe, we anticipate a contraction in new install capacity as countries like France extend projects to the deadlines like six months to accommodate for COVID-19 related delays. In India, despite five months COD extension delays caused by a combination of the pandemic and the seasonal monsoons are expected to take a toll on the country's aggregate installed capacity this year. While the global PV industry has clearly not been immune to the pandemic's impact, some developments this year will shape the long term future of the industry. The first of these is a range of new policies designed to decarbonize electricity and mobility further while powering post pandemic economic recovery plans. Arguably, the most wide ranging example is the European Green Deal, which is aimed to transform the bloc into a carbon neutral economy by 2050 by decarbonizing electricity and transportation. The Green Deal which could make solar the number one source of electricity in Europe by 2025 is an example of how political leaders are bundling post pandemic economic recovery with decarbonization commitments. The other comment I would like to note is the growing recognition of the importance of self reliance, and a diversified solar supply chain in some of the world's biggest solar markets. A combination of factors including governmental policy, increasingly tense bilateral relationships, the pandemic, and pricing and supply volatility in the crystal silicon industry, has reignited the debate around risk posed by allowing a single country to dominate the PV solar supply chain. Responses have been varied with new rules that favor PV modules with a lower carbon footprint in South Korea, while India and Europe have renewed talks on domestic manufacturing. Earlier this month the United States, the President issued a proclamation revoking the exemption of bifacial panels from the application of selection 201 safeguard tariffs. Although this exemption is currently subject to a temporary restraining order, preventing the presidential bifacial exemption revocation from taking effect. The common thread, however, is an underlying desire to boost supply certainty and security, while safeguarding domestic manufacturing from unfair competition. In summary, we believe our investment thesis remains inviting as we are well positioned to benefit from the current dynamics in the solar industry. As shown on slide 5, our mid to late stage pipeline of opportunities remains robust. And it's increased 0.5 gigawatts despite bookings of 1.6 gigawatts since the prior earnings call. In terms of segment mix, this opportunity pipeline of 8.3 gigawatts includes approximately 7.7 gigawatts of potential module sales, with the remaining representing potential systems business opportunities. In terms of geographical breakdown, North America remains the region with the largest number of opportunities at 7.1 gigawatt; Europe represents 0.9 gigawatt with the remainder in Asia Pacific. As a reminder, a mid to late stage pipeline reflects those opportunities we believe, could book within the next 12 months, and is a subset of a much larger pipeline of opportunities which total 16 gigawatts of opportunities in 2022 and beyond. From a cost perspective, we indicated during our Q2 earnings call that our Vietnam factory we have achieved a 40% reduction relative to our 2016 Series 4 cost per watt. Building on this momentum as a reflection of our manufacturing execution, we have also achieved this milestone at our Malaysia factory during the quarter. Note as a reminder, our cost per watt metric includes sales rate and warranty. From build materials perspective, growing solar demand and the emergence of bifacial modules, which generally are dual glass, had contributed to pressures on the supply and cost of PV glass. Similar to our shipment strategy, our glass procurement strategy largely relies on four contracts, which has a substantially mitigated this impact today. From a fleet wide perspective, as a result of our continued manufacturing execution, we remain on track to achieve and potentially exceed our 10% cost per watt reduction target between where we ended 2019 and expect to in 2020. In Ohio, our third quarter core cost to watt produce continued to be higher than our international average. Our US manufacturing provides strategic benefits and over time, we anticipate a reduction in the cost for watt through the following initiatives. Firstly, by installing additional tools and optimizing the two Ohio factories into one consolidated platform, we expect to increase nameplate capacity slightly more than 25% to 2.4 gigawatts by the end of 2021. With this additional capacity, we are able to amortize the fixed cost structure including labor and depreciation over more watts produced. We are starting to see this benefit as reflected in October capacity utilization. Secondly, as previously disclosed, we have contracted a flow class supplier agreement with a producer in Ohio. We anticipate starting to receive the initial benefits of this agreement in Q4, and continuing into early 2021, with an expected reduction in the associated variable build and material costs. Finally, our manufacturing yield in Ohio was approximately two percentage points below the fleet average. Through the implementation of learnings from our international factories, we see a path to achieve similar yields at our Ohio factors. Through the implementation of these key initiatives among others, we anticipate our Ohio cost per watt premium over time to reduce to $0.02, including sales rate. Turning to slide 6, I would like to discuss the relative performance of our technology and the lab versus real world operating conditions. PV module lab testing protocols were developed in the early days of solar using standard test conditions of 25 degrees centigrade at a terrestrial standard spectrum. PV modules in the field, however, exposed to variable conditions, including heat, humidity, dust, and extreme weather events such as wind and hail. Each of these factors cause deviation from lab performance, with the effects varies by technology. Ultimately, lifecycle energy produced in the field is what drives project economics. And by analyzing the factors that cause divergence from laboratory performance, we can better understand the value proposition of our Cad tel technology. Firstly, as it relates to temperature, module device, operating conditions can exceed 70 degrees centigrade. Module watt is however is assigned at lab standard test condition of 25 degrees. And as panels heat up over the course of the day beyond this threshold, there's a corresponding decline in power. Series 6 has a temperature coefficient advantage relative to crystalline silicon, which is anticipated to increase further with our copper replacement module, meaning Cad tel responds more efficiently than crystalline silicon to real world temperatures. Secondly, due to the unique spectrum of light Series 6 captures our technology outperforms crystalline silicon on a watt for watt basis in humid environments. Thirdly, estimated useful life of PV power plants can exceed 30 years as a result, aggregation is an important driver of project economics. With the expected implementation of our copper replacement program, we anticipate a reduction in long-term aggregation beyond our current warranty of 50 basis points per year. We expect this innovation will enhance our competitive advantage by increasing lifecycle energy and project value for our customers. Finally, as it relates to by facial technology, while there is a potential for backside energy gain, the ground reflectivity, known as a [Veto] varies by geography, climate and season, and is often inversely correlated with hot and humid climates. Slide 6 depicts the relative lifecycle kilowatt hours expected to be produced by our equal watts of our copper replace Series 6 modules, which we call Series six CuRe, relative to leading crystalline silicon by facial modules. As a result of the aforementioned advantages, as compared to leading crystalline silicon by facial modules, we estimate that our Series 6 CuRe module can produce up to 10% more life cycles kilowatt hours per kilowatt install, in climates with extreme heat and humidity, including Brazil, Central Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and southern United States. Importantly, when implemented, our CuRe product is expected to be well positioned in other key markets with more moderate climates including France, Spain, Japan, and the Midwestern United States. We expect to begin delivering 36 CuRe models in the second half of 2021. Turning to slide 7, I would like to review a framework that highlights the factors that influence ASPs, starting with bifacial. While, backside energy gain is accretive to ASP, with only a modest increase to manufacturing cost a lot, the downstream costs related to additional balance of system structures, increased vegetation management, and higher cost of capital associated with our [Veto] uncertainties are partially offset to this ASP benefit as it relates to crystalline silicon with larger form factors, the potential ASP benefit largely stems from the dilution in the manufacturer's fix bill of material costs rather than an increase in energy density. This potential cost reduction, which may be passed through to the customer is partially offset by the downstream cost of additional support structures, physical handling challenges with oversized modules, increased insurance premiums, and risk associated with cell cracking and wind loads. As relates to our copper replacement Series 6, once implemented, we anticipated ASP accretion due to increase efficiency, improved temperature coefficient, and a significant reduction in long-term aggregation. Importantly, this innovation is driven by efficiency improvements, which results in dilution of our variable and fixed bill of material costs. We expect to capture this ASP accretion as a technology does not significantly impact balance of system and development costs or project risks. Finally, it's important to note the opportunities with our Technology Roadmap, with cell efficiencies entitlement effect in excess of 25%, coupled with the energy advantages of Cad tel, we believe the outlook for our technology platform remains strong. In support of our roadmap over the over the coming quarters, we anticipate certifying a new world record for Cad tel. I'll turn the call over to Alex who will discuss our third quarter financial results and fourth quarter guidance. Alex? Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Starting on slide 8, I'll cover the income statement highlights for third quarter. Net sales in Q3 were $928 million, an increase of $285 million compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the sales of certain Japan and India projects as well as an increase in the volume of Series 6 modules sold to third parties. On a second basis are the percentage of total quarterly net sales and module segment revenue in Q3 was 46% compared to 58% in Q2. Total gross margin was 32% in Q3 compared to 21% in Q2. The System segment gross margin was 33% in Q3 compared to 21% in Q2. This increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned international project sale, and the sale of early stage development assets, including a project entity associated with the General Motors PPA. This is partially offset by $14 million performance liquidated damages stemming from underperformance of third party equipment and several of our legacies EPC projects. Module segment gross margin was 30% in Q3 compared to 22% in Q2, the several positive and negative factors been impacted this Q3 result. Firstly, we recorded a reduction in our product warranty liability reserve, which was primarily due to low warranty settlements than previously estimated for our Series 2 technology. This resulted in a $20 million reduction of our warranty liability and the corresponding benefits the cost of sale. Secondly, certain of our legacy module sale agreements are covered by a collection and recycling program, where a corresponding expense, the estimated future cost obligation was recognized at the time of sale. In Q3, we recognize the $19 million reduction in our module collection and recycling liability due to changes in the estimated timing of cash flows associated with capital, labor and maintenance costs. This also results in a corresponding benefit to cost of sales. Finally, we incurred an impairment loss of $17 million for certain module manufacturing equipment, including framing and assembly tools no longer compatible with our long term Technology Roadmap. This is also a corresponding increased cost of sales. On a net basis, these factors increased module segment gross margin dollars and percent by $21 million and 5%, respectively. Separately, our module segment gross margin was impacted by negative $6.5 million of Series 4 gross margin, which included $2 million a decommissioning and severance cost. Our Series 4 gross margin reduced overall module segment gross margin by 1.5%. These facts in mind, we're pleased with our overall module segment gross margin result and our Q3 Series 6 gross margin relative to our previous expectation of 25%. This was exceeded despite lower than expected Q3 volume sold and despite incurring $3.5 million of unforeseen COVID-19 driven logistics costs in the quarter. Additionally, another reminder sales price and warranty are included in cost of sales, and reduced module segment gross margin by 6%. SG&A and R&D expenses total $73 million in the third quarter, a decrease of approximately $1 million compared to the prior quarter. That decrease is primarily driven by lower severance and projects impairment, partially offset by higher legal and incentive compensation expense. Production startup which is included in operating expenses totaled $13 million in the third quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior quarter. And this increase is driven by higher startup expenses in our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia. Interest income was $2 million per quarter compared to $4 million in Q2. This decrease was primarily driven by low interest rates and investment balance for our marketable securities. We recorded tax expense of $38 million in the third quarter compared to $10 million in q2. This increase in tax expense largely attributable to higher pretax earnings in Q3. The combination of aforementioned items led to third quarter earnings per share of $1.45 compared to $0.35 in the second quarter. I'll next turn to slide 9 discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter of $1.7 billion, an increase of approximately $29 million compared to the prior quarter. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $261 million, the decrease from $465 million in end of Q2 as a result of international project sales. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding project is sold. Our net cash position which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities, less debt increased by approximately $233 million to $1.4 billion. This increase is driven by proceeds from system sales and module segment operating cash flows, which was partially offset by capital expenditures and loan repayments associated with the Ishikawa project sale. Net working capital in Q3, which includes non current project assets and exclude cash and marketable securities decreased by $18 million compared to the prior quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities was $208 million in the third quarter compared to $148 million in the prior quarter. As it relates to our Chicago project, we repaid the project that prior to close which resulted in higher operating cash flows upon transaction closed. As it relates to Miyagi and Anamizu project, the associated project that was assumed by the buyer, which reduced cash, outflows from financing activities and operating cash inflows or transaction flow. Finally, capital expenditures were $106 million in the third quarter, which brings our year-to-date, total $327 million as we continue our Series 6 capacity expansion.  Turn to slide 10, I'll next provide an updated perspective on 2020 guidance. On our Q2 call, we provided guidance metrics that we believe were largely within our control or within reasonable line of sight at the time. This included production, operating expense, and capital expenditure guidance for the full year 2020. While significant uncertainties remain regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and financial results; we believe visibility into our financial performance for the fourth quarter has improved on account of the following. Firstly, at the time of our Q2 earnings call, we cited tax equity market uncertainty for projects set to achieve commercial operation in 2021, which has the potential to impact our module customers and our self developed Sun Streams 2 project. Although provisions for credit loss have stabilized somewhat in Q3, significant uncertainty remains for Q4 and 2021. Forecasting tax capacity for the second half of 2021 remains difficult to due to uncertain economic outlook, government response and trajectory of COVID-19. However, some tax equity providers have begun committing to 2021 financings albeit concerned in volume. While this is incrementally positive for the US solar market, we remain strongly supportive of a direct pay legislative solution in lieu of the investment tax credit to alleviate potential disruptions in the tax equity market. Secondly, with the sale of our American Kings projects in Q2, the previously mentioned sales of the Japan and India assets in Q3, and with the expected sale of a Sun Streams 2 project in Q4 2020 or Q1 of 2021; we have a viable path to close each project sale contemplated in our original 2020 guidance from February. Finally, at the time of the February guidance call we anticipated fully and module shipments of 5.86 gigawatts. Shipments through the end of the third quarter total 3.7 gigawatts which are below our year-to-date expectation largely due to COVID-19 driven project, financing, logistics and customer delays. This has resulted in a shipment profile incrementally weighted to the second half of the year. However, a significant volume of modules that we anticipate recognizing in 2020 revenue are currently in transit, or will be shipped in the coming weeks. With the improved visibility for system sales for 2020, and year-to-date progress to module shipments, we are reinstating financial guidance for the fourth quarter that considers this range of outcomes for module revenue recognition timing and closing of the Sun Streams 2 sale. Given the uncertainty around any outcome from the evaluation of strategic options for our US project development business, and the sale timing of our North American O&M business; our fourth quarter guidance assumes no change for our existing lines of business. And today while we've largely managed the impacts of COVID-19 in our business and has not had significant impact on our operation. Our guidance assumes we will continue to be able to mitigate any such impact on our supply chain operation without the incurrence of the material cost. I'll now review our fourth quarter guidance ranges with implied full year 2020 guidance range is included on slide 11. Starting with shipment, due to the aforementioned uncertainties, we anticipate volumes of 1.8 to 2 gigawatts in Q4, which implies 5.5 to 5.7 gigawatts for the full year. Production in Q4 is expected to be 1.5 gigawatts that implies full year 2020 production of six gigawatts including 0.2 gigawatts of Series 4. Not that our full year production guidance 6 gigawatts has increased by 0.1 gigawatts relative to the guidance provided during our Q2 earnings call. Net sales are expected to be between $540 million and $790 million in Q4, which accounts for potential delays in the close of our Sun Streams 2 project sale and module revenue recognition timing. Total gross margin is projected to be 26.5% to 27% in Q4. And note that we anticipate the closing of the Sun Streams 2 project sale will be slightly diluted to overall gross margin percentage. Module segment gross margin is projected to be between 27% and 28% in Q4. We anticipate our module segment gross margin will be supported by an increase in volume sold and continued reductions in our cost per watt, partially offset by a modest supply in ASP. And included in this gross margin guidance is an anticipated 40 basis point gross margin percentage drag due to Series 4.  Operating expenses are expected to be between $90 million and $95 million in Q4. This includes production staff and expenses related to our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia at $15 million. We anticipate R&D and SG&A costs, excluding staff and expenses of $75 million to $80 million in Q4. Our current implied full year 2020 operating expense guidance of $351 million to $356 million is within the guidance range provided during our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Operating income is estimated to be between $50 million and $120 million in Q4. Turning to non operating items, we expect interest income, interest expense and other income to negative $5 million. Anticipated tax benefit of $45 million to $ 60 million in Q4, which includes a discrete tax benefit of $60 million associated with the closing of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax position. These results in Q4 earnings per share guidance range of $1 to $1.50 per share, and $3.65 to $4.15 per share implied for the full year 2020. Our 2020 capital expenditure forecast to $450 million to $550 million remains unchanged from the prior quarter. Our year end 2020 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.2 million to $1.3 billion, decrease relative to our Q3 net cash positions primarily due to capital expenditures and project spend related to our Sun Streams 2 project. Turning to slide 12, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Firstly, we had Q3 earnings per share of $1.45, increased our quarter and net cash position, improved module segment gross margin quarter-over- quarter and reinstated financial guidance for the fourth quarter. Secondly, we had strong manufacturing performance with each factory averaging over 100% capacity utilization in Q3, and that our Malaysia factory achieved our midterm cost to watt target of 40% reduction from 2016 Serie forecast. Thirdly, demand for our Series 6 products is robust and we had continued success adding into our contracting pipeline with net bookings of 1.6 gigawatts since the prior earnings call and 4.1 gigawatts year-to-date. Our contracted backlog remains a pillar of strength with 6.7 gigawatts contracted for expected deliveries in 2021 and 3.6 gigawatts contracted for expected deliveries across 2022 and 2023. And finally, despite ongoing challenges relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain pleased with all operational and financial performance. And with that we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. PhilipShen: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the questions. I have a few here, so thank you for your patience. The first one is on CIGS. I think we picked up recently that you guys restarted your CIGS research efforts. So wanted to get a sense for what that might mean, relative to Cad tel. Second, I think you guys have talked about getting to eight gigawatts of capacity by year end 2021. Can you talk about the conditions that need to exist to consider expanding capacity, and then what the timing and the locations of that might look like? And then number three here, with the ever growing importance of security of supply, especially in the face of the Shin Jong risk and the concentration of capacity in China? Can you talk about how the tenor of conversations with customers may have changed over the past month? And then help us understand how much is booked in 2021 and 2022 and 2023? Thanks, guys. MarkWidmar: I'll let Alex take the last one booked in 2021, 2022 and 23. So I'll try to take the other three because he can gather those numbers. So your question is around CIGS and where to the extent that we are looking at that as a technology or really any technology because at the end of the day core module, technology manufacturing company, that's what we do. And we need to continue to find ways to differentiate ourselves on a technology basis and to find ways to be as disruptive as we can with our technology and always increase advantages relative to crystalline silicon and whatever the ultimate competition may be. We've looked at things in the past. We've looked at the crystalline silicon and mono crystalline silicon. We look at perovskites; we look at everything and as it relates, if your question is CIGS is -- an indication that we don't have confidence cad tel that's not anywhere close to the reality. Cad tel in my mind will always be advantaged relative to six. And we believe it has a roadmap to be advantage relative to crystalline silicon. But the reason that we would look at crystalline silicon, or CIGS or perovskites, or organic TV or anything else that may be out there is how do you complement the two? And we've mentioned this before that we believe over time, that multi junction type of technology will evolve into the marketplace. And cad tel in of itself is a very good top so from a standpoint of having a high band gap. So it captures a significant portion of the overall sun spectrum. And when you need that as a second cell underneath that would be what's complimentary to that. And could it be six? Could it be crystalline silicon? Could it be processed at some form or fashion?  And so we're always going to look at that. We believe it's the evolution of technology that will happen in the future, we've highlighted in previous calls too that we are reinvigorating our advanced technology team. And so to the extent that we need to look at different materials, different semiconductors can be complimentary to cad tel, we'll continue to do that. But I don't look at the CIGS or really any of those other technologies as is replacing cad tel. The core will be of our semiconductor and overall device will be cad tel. The question is, is there something else that becomes complimentary with it, and we need to look at all options that could be out there. As relates to the expansion in a gigawatts? I mean, yes, we have I think indicated, our nameplate would be about eight gigawatts at the end of 2021. We are in the last phase of our Series 6 transition with our second factory in Malaysia with startup and current plans will start up in Q1 of 2021, we are looking beyond that. And as we've always said, we've got a balanced business model between growth, liquidity and profitability. And we obviously understand the value of growth and the leverage against fixed costs and flow through contribution margin. And so we are evaluating options and we will look at where we can create the next disruptive lowest cost factory. So, as we continue down our journey with Series 6, one of the things that we pass ourselves with, probably about nine months or a year ago is what's the factory of the future look like? What's the next generation technology in terms of driving the lowest cost for our cad tel platform?  And so we have been doing that and trying to find a way to create that disruptive, lowest cost from the fleet factory, which under that construct, most likely would not be in the US for the reasons that we've mentioned. And we believe we have relative representation here with costs almost 2.5 gigawatts in the US. But other markets, we would look to, India could be one; we've talked before about potentially, our 15 factory in Germany started out as an easy way to get to market quickly and leverage that factory that we closed down almost a decade ago.  So those are things that we're looking at. And we also believe that as we've had indicated, I think, Alex mentioned in his prepared remarks that freight is basically 6% of gross margin right now, 6% of the ASP effectively. And so getting closer to market and driving down your freight costs is an advantage that we continue to look to. So being in a market that can consume 2.5 to 5 gigawatts of volume on a recurring basis, it would be important. So those are the many different factors that we look at as we think about expansion. And but just want to make sure it is clear that is on the agenda of things that we're looking at this point. So why security in any impact with what's happened with the China, the latest evolution now being on the potential use of forced labor and implications of data and potentially product being banned in the US. It's one of many different dimensions that a lot of our customers have as it relates to relying on China in long term and the uncertainty around that. I don't know if it would have increased meaningfully over the last month, it's just one of many different concerns that they've had, I mean, even with the discussion around bulk power systems and potential implications around that. The modules have been looked at, is there a risk of that can be impacted. The discussion of extension of the 201 tariffs; there's many different things that come into the mix. And a lot of our customers here in the US in particular want to do business with an American company. They want to de-risk their supply. It's related to ability to deliver against commitments and any uncertainties that could be imposed upon the Chinese supplier and some of the issues that are coming up as you mentioned with forced labor. So I don't know if it's changed significantly in the last month, it clearly is top of mind. And it's just one of many different factors that all of our customers think about when they have to rely upon their Chinese, our Chinese counterparty as a supplier. Alex? AlexBradley: Yes, just to throw the numbers on the end of this. So right now we have 6.7 gigawatts booked for 2021 and 3.6 gigawatts booked across 2022 and beyond. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. BrianLee: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a good quarter. A couple of things from my end, I guess first, I know there's a lot of moving parts here on the module gross margins this quarter, I'm getting to like a 26.5% clean number for Series 6, which is 150 basis points higher quarter-on-quarter, I guess first question, is that the right math? And sort of what happened during the quarter that got you the additional 150 basis points because I think last quarter, you were talking about sort of a flattish sequential trajectory?  And then the second question would be around, I didn't hear it on the climate. I missed it. But are you still on track to hit that 300 basis point gross margin expansion for Series 6 in Q4, offer this higher run rate if my math is right. And then maybe just lastly, how should we think about cost reductions in 2021? You said you're running at or above the 10% target for this year, what sort of gross margin expansion potential do you have as you move into 2021, given the cost reduction progress you're making, and also the fact that pricing seems to be fairly stable for you guys. Thank you. AlexBradley: I'll start on the gross margin, if Mark also comments on the cost reduction beyond that. So you're doing basically the right math with the reported module segment gross margins about 29.5 and you've got three big things that moved in there, by reduction our warranty liability, about $20 million, but the good guy, reduction in the end of life recycling about $19 million also good guy, then you got an impairment charge about $17 million. That's good again, so we net all of those, you've got about $21 million, or about five percentage points, you take that down to about 24.5. And then we said that within the overall margin, we had about a $6.5 million, or 1.5% negative associated with Serious 4, you add that back in, you get to about 26%. And then on top of that, we did have some COVID charges in that number, there's about $3.5 million of COVID charges, you back that out again, you're going to be another 50 to 100 basis points. So somewhere around 26.5 to 27 around the Series 6 number. So yes, we're a little ahead of where we expect it to be. And part of that as a function of how well the factories have been running. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've now managed to get to the cost reduction target that we expected in our high volume manufacturing by the end of the year. In Q3, we're already there on Malaysia site we already achieved that last quarter in Vietnam. So running a little ahead there. In terms of where we think we'll be by Q4, we are going to be about 27.5 and 28 gross margin on Series 6 is the number we're guiding for Q4 so that one held roughly steady from where we were last quarter. And then in terms of cost reduction, beyond that, we are not giving guidance out through 2021. Mark, if you want to comment anything? MarkWidmar: If I guess I would say just on that and it's similar to what I said in my comments that the things that are continued to drive improvements to the cost for watt, improve throughput, improve lots, and improve yields. And so what I said in my remarks is that we just opened up the 445 watt bin. And then over the next few quarters, we're going to be at the 455 and north of that shortly thereafter. And so that improvement in watts is going to help drive down costs. So that helps the throughput as we've already highlighted is going to continue to increase. So that's another significant lever that is going to help drive down the cost per watt. The other one is we highlighted just the class supply for our Perrysburg factory which will start to take shape in Q4. And you'll see you realize the full benefits starting in Q1. So the bill of material costs in Perrysburg in particular is going to be helpful. But we're also working on significant -- taking significant costs out of the frame, which will help drive costs further.  And then we're actually looking at the change in the profile of the module such that is actually thinner. So when you look at the glass plus the frame, we're trying to make the profile of the module center, which will also then allow us to add about 10% more modules, a little over 10% more modules occur, container from a freight standpoint, which will help drive down that cost. So we've got teams that are really multi dimensional, looking across all aspects and everything that is associated with the cost of the product, and ultimately delivering it to the end customer. So as Alex said, we're not guiding at this point time for 2021 but we are tracking to be ahead of what we thought where we thought we were going to be on a cost per watt basis as we exit the year, which is a good place to be. And then we still have a number of other initiatives that will further drive down on our cost per watt as we go into 2021. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird. BenKallo: Hey, great quarter, guys. So three or four questions here. So can you talked about your utilization here above it was like and how should we expect that going forward? I know Mark had just talked about watts and yield. But how much can we go above nameplate capacity? And when we think about your target for next year, how much is that considered enough? And then you don't talk about efficiency anymore. But can you talk to us about the theoretical efficiency of cad tel? And where we can go from a 445 watt panel and above? And then the last question, I guess, the 2.5 gigawatts before you place new capacity somewhere, if it's in, I get $400 million of CapEx, does it take you selling the systems business before you make that go no go decision? And can you talk about just the incentive to onshore new capacity? Thanks. MarkWidmar: So from, Ben, where we ultimately -- what I said in the script was that where we are on our trajectory right now for our two facility plants in Ohio is to drive the nameplate capacity up to 25% above than we were originally launched that. The objective would be to drive it effectively to about low 30s. So there's, let's say there's another five to about eight percentage points of incremental utilization that we would like to get out of all the factories. So first, we got to get everything up to 25%, right. We're not necessarily there yet, you can see by what we're running, we're -- call it 120, I think was the best that we highlighted. Right, now we've got a path to get everything up to around 25%, near term, with a goal of getting it up to low 30s, calling around 30% to 33%, which would be another five to eight percentage points above for our near term objective is, and a little bit of work still to be done there. But I've been very impressed with the team's capabilities making that happen. On the efficiency side, as you indicated, where are we going with the technology? I mean what I did say to someone, one of my very last comments was the entitlement at the cell level for cad tel is 25% plus. And that would translate into something close to call it a 23% or so efficient module, based on normal conversion between cell to module. We're in the process right now of validating. And hopefully, we'll have in the next few quarters, a new record for efficiency with I don't know if there'll be a cell or module. So looking at what we end up doing on that, there are some items on our roadmap that would really be beneficial to help validate that through demonstrating that either with a cell or module, which by default, will then drive to a record efficiency. So there's still more room to go yet on to core technology and driving to higher level of efficiencies. The other one that I mentioned that, again, it's complimentary, and it's in. It's a combination, this multi junction technology that we talked about, which would take efficiencies even above and beyond kind of that profile. As I mentioned because now you have two cells that are harvesting the overall photons and converting them into electrons, which you say that whatever you can do at the top cell level capability would be further enhanced with the bottom cell. And so the technology and efficiency can go even beyond kind of those numbers that I represented around theoretically, right. So there's still ways to go yet on the technology, and we're working very hard to make sure we can realize those benefits over the next several years. On a CapEx basis, with this, I mentioned, I alluded to this, kind of what is the factory of the future, and what is the most disruptive, lowest cost factory that we can create, starting with a blank sheet of paper that also drives down the CapEx investment relative to what we initially communicated with Series 6, so that can drive it down probably close to 15% to 20% on a CapEx basis, so we have a roadmap to drive more CapEx out, and to do more efficient, so therefore, we can obviously, the cost of deploying new factory would CapEx per watt basis will be lower than when we originally launched at, which is an objective that we've had. And it is tied to the realization of the systems energy services and proceeds so, it's not -- they are two independent things. I mean, there's not a constraint, you can see where our balance sheet is right now that ability to continue to invest and in the capacity and the roadmap that we have in front of us, that there's not any linkage, per se, to any proceeds we've received from assistance business or the energy services business. Operator : Our final question comes from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. MichaelWeinstein: Hi, guys. Can you talk about what would drive capacity as in a particular regions or existing locations as you've in the past few years, this is driven by a move from the Series 4 to Series 6. Going forward, is it demands growth, or something else that drives it? MarkWidmar: It's, whenever we grow, we want to make sure that it's tied to a market indicator, right. And basically really has to start with relative competitive advantage and position of the technology, the market has to be there, right and good thing about where we are now with solar procurement, it used to be policy lead now it's economic procurement, people are buying solar from the pure economic standpoint. And so I don't really see any constraints on the market, per se. But we do look to markets where we would have advantages around our technology. So hot, humid climates, for example, would be a market, they would be attractive to us; again, being closer to the market, or at least driving efficient shipment, logistics routes to access the market is important. The reality is freight cost is 10%, north of 10% of the overall cost of the product. And so if you can get that number down, say cut it in half, you get 5% savings just by getting closer to the customer and reducing your overall freight costs to deliver over the technology. There are many other factors that we use when we screen a site; energy is a meaningful component of our overall costs. So we have to have competitive cost of energy, labor rates have to be competitive, from math standpoint as well, while the processes are largely automated, still major component of the overall cost structure that has to be thought through and whenever we make decisions of where we're going to manufacture. But the reality is that we will grow most likely it's probably going to be outside of the US as we currently envision it, it could change. We have ability just to expand within the footprint and drive more throughput of what we already have here in the US, as we think about where our next factory would be, as we currently envision it would probably be in an international market somewhere close to customers, close to where there's a strong recurring annual demand requirement, and one that we have our technology is well positioned and competitively advantage whether it's hot, humid climates, whether it's the advantages of our Co2 footprint, environmental aspects around our technology, which more and more markets are starting to value. Those are the types of things that we take in consideration as we think about any expansion. Operator : We completed the allotted time for questions. This concludes today's conference call.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results as well as its guidance for 2021. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Following his remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy outlook. Alex will then discuss our financial guidance for 2021. Following the remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations, including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today\u2019s press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the entire First Solar team for their hard work and perseverance throughout 2020. Although 2020 was a very challenging year, I\u2019m proud of the way our team responded with our ongoing commitment to health and safety, delivering value to our customers and achieving our objectives in this unprecedented year. While, Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview of our 2020 financial results, I would like to first note our full year EPS results of $3.73. This result came within, but towards the low end of the guidance range we provided at the time of our third quarter earnings call, largely due to the volume and timing of our Sun Streams 2 project sale. Despite this timing impact, a continued intense competition across the crystalline PV supply chain and unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic, we are very pleased with our financial and operational results in 2020. Turning to Slide 3, I will discuss some of our key 2020 accomplishments. Firstly, our vertically integrated manufacturing process, diversified supply chain and differentiated CadTel technology enabled us to mitigate potential disruptions to our manufacturing operations from the pandemic. Accordingly, we produced 5.9 gigawatts of Series 6 and exited the year with a top production bin of 445 watts. Secondly, driven by continued strong manufacturing execution, in Q4 we achieved a year-on-year 10% cost per watt reduction despite an increase in volume sold from our higher cost for higher facilities and an increase in sales freight costs. Thirdly, early generation First Solar CadTel modules that were installed at an NREL test facility in 1995, reached an installed life of 25 years and demonstrated a 25 year degradation rate of 48 basis points per year. While our manufacturing processes, product design, efficiency and warranted long-term degradation rates have improved significantly over the past 25 years, this result help us understand a legacy performance baseline and provides further confidence in the superior long-term durability and degradation performance of today\u2019s Series 6 product. Fourthly, we extended our limited power output warranty from 25 to 30 years for our Series 6 modules and our Series 6 modules are now protected by the industry\u2019s first and only product warranty that specifically covers power loss from cell cracking, which can have a meaningful impact on reducing systems insurance costs. Finally, at the year-end we had shipments of 5.5 gigawatts \u2013 bookings of 5.5 gigawatts and contracted an additional 0.7 gigawatt of volume that remains subject to conditions precedent. Overall, our operational financial results in 2020 have build momentum as we move into 2021. Turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll provide an update on our Series 6 capacity ramp and manufacturing performance. Over the course of 2020, we realized significant operational improvements comparing December fleet wide metrics year-on-year, megawatts produced per day increased to 17.3 megawatts, an increase of 23%. Fleet wide capacity utilization increased to 117% an increase of 20 percentage points. Product yield increased to 97.6%, an increase of 3.2 percentage points. Average watts per module increased to 439 watts, an increase of 9 watts. And as noted, our top production bin increased to 445 watts. Our manufacturing discipline and execution enabled us to achieve our cost per watt reduction objective for the year. We exited 2020 with 6.3 gigawatts of nameplate manufacturing capacity and effective January 1, we have rerated our throughput entitlement for purposes of calculating capacity utilization. Since launching Series 6, less than three years ago, the factory throughput entitlement was based on the initial tool set in factory design. Given the significant improvements made over the years, we have revised our throughput entitlements to reflect the 2020 exit rate throughput. Our strong execution has continued into 2021 with improvement across all key metrics since year end. In addition to February, we commenced initial production of our Series \u2013 our second Series 6 low cost factory in Malaysia. With less than three weeks of production, the factory is ramping nicely with demonstrated capacity utilization reaching approximately 80% yields in excess of 90% and a top production bin of 450 watts. By the end of the year, we anticipate our Malaysia factories will have a nameplate capacity of 3 gigawatts. Second, briefly on our systems segment. In February, we completed the sale of our 150 megawatt AC Sun Streams 2 project to Longroad Energy. We also signed agreements with Longroad to sell the Sun Streams 4 and 5 projects and are in late stage negotiations to sign an agreement to sell our Sun Streams 3 project. As part of this portfolio acquisition, Longroad intends to utilize 1 gigawatt of Series 6, of which 785 megawatts will represent new bookings upon the closing of these transactions. Prior to signing the potential agreement to sell Sun Streams 3, the project PPA was terminated, which enabled Longroad to include Sun Streams 3, 4 and 5 projects and their power marketing efforts after transactions closed. While, this resulted in an approximately 85 megawatts systems booking in February at the time of closing, we expect this opportunity will be recognized as a new module only booking. Turning to Slide 5, I\u2019ll next discuss our most recent bookings in greater detail. Our recent bookings momentum has continued with 3.3 gigawatts of net booking since the October earnings call. After accounting for shipments of approximately 1.8 gigawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments would extend into 2024, our 13.7 gigawatts. The majority of the bookings since the prior earnings call have been third-party module sales, which totaled 3.3 gigawatts. We continue to see an increase in multi-year module sales agreements, driven by our customer\u2019s need for certainty in terms of technology they\u2019re investing in and their suppliers, integrity and ethics. Representative of this, we have executed an agreement with Intersect Power to supply up to 2.4 gigawatts for deployment in projects in 2022 and 2023 of which approximately 2 gigawatts is recognized as a booking. In addition to this new booking, Intersect has the option to utilize an additional 0.4 gigawatts of module volume to support their portfolio project up to 2.4 gigawatts. We\u2019ve also secured 340 megawatts for deliveries in 2023 with a leading provider of hydrogen fuel cell solutions. A pillar of growth for the hydrogen economy is the ability to cost effectively produce large scale green hydrogen with renewable energy sources. With an environment of CadTel technology, we are well-positioned to address this market need. Additionally in Japan, we have continued success adding to our contract assistance backlog with the addition of two projects, totaling 51 megawatts. With new net bookings of 3.3 gigawatts and with additional 1.4 gigawatts of expected bookings associated with the closing on the sale of the Sun Streams portfolio and the U.S. project development business, we are pleased with the robust demand for our Series 6 product. Including these new bookings, volumes contracted to conditions precedent and the potential 0.4 gigawatts of incremental volume related to the Intersect transaction. We have 7.2 gigawatts of volume for potential deliveries in 2021, 5.9 gigawatts in 2022 and 2.3 gigawatts across 2023 and 2024. Overall, while the market remains competitive, we are very pleased with the pricing levels that we are securing to date for our differentiated Series 6 Plus and CuRe modules. And an industry that sells electrons and were products are evaluated based on the quantity of electrons they will produce, we also differentiate our business model through our commitments to an environmental footprint of our technology, product secularity and supply chain transparency. We call it Responsible Solar, and you can learn more about it at our corporate website. Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019d like to discuss the strategy and advantages of this approach. Firstly, due to our resource efficient manufacturing process, our CadTel modules have the lowest carbon and water footprint available in the market today. With this advantage position Series 6 is the world\u2019s first PV product to be included in the EPEAT registered for sustainable products, which conforms to the NSF 457, the industry\u2019s first sustainability leadership standard. Designed to help institutional purchasers, EPEAT is used by national governments, including the United States and thousands of private sector, institutional purchasers worldwide as part of their sustainable procurement decisions. Secondly, we have over a decade of experience in operating high value PV recycling facilities on a global scale and remain the only solar manufacturer to have global in-house recycling capabilities. This recycling process establishes a circular economy by recovering more than 90% of the semiconductor materials for reuse in First Solar\u2019s models and 90% of the glass reuse in new glass container products. Thirdly, our vertically integrated manufacturing process enhances our supply chain transparency and control over end to end manufacturing process. We believe that our responsible solar strategy is the right way to do business and in a growing number of markets yields an economic advantage. For example, France already has a rule that favors PV modules with a low carbon footprint, Spain has also appears to be moving towards incorporating the carbon footprint metric and its renewable energy procurement program. The reason update requires owners of renewable energy generation assets to submit carbon footprint data to the countries renewable energy registery, gathering the information needed to shape the procurement mechanism that may benefit low carbon solar. In the United States, Vectren a utility that services Indiana and Ohio included an environmental emission minimization objective within their integrated resource plan. This objective accounts for the cradle-to-grave emissions impacts of different forms of generation, including the low carbon footprint of thin film PV modules compared to crystalline silicon. In addition, Alliant Energy and Consumers Energy, two utilities in the Midwest have included the after mentioned NSF 457 sustainability leadership standard for PV modules and inverters in their most recent solar solicitations. We\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to touch on reported use of forced labor in China\u2019s polysilicon manufacturing industry. We have repeatedly and unequivocally condemned the preparative use of forced labor in China\u2019s PV solar supply chain, and we\u2019ll continue to do so as long as it remains an issue. We also reiterated our commitment to zero tolerance of forced labor throughout our supply chain. We believe there should be no place for a solar panels or even a single component, no matter how small is produced by a human being against their will. We\u2019re seeing the reports that authorities in the United States are developing plans to expand their Jinjang specific import regulations to include solar. And in the latest version of the Forced Labor Prevention Act bill the U.S. House of Representatives, including polysilicon as a high priority sector. We recognize the challenges of this potentially trades for companies that have traditionally relied on Chinese-based firms for their modules. But as an industry, we cannot accept a view of solar at any costs. This is an important reminder that over-reliance on China to supply subsidized solar panels comes at a price that may not always be reflected on the bottom line is a price that many include \u2013 they include needing to look the other way on environmental, social and human costs. It\u2019s also yet another reminder one of several we\u2019ve had this past year about the importance of diversity of supply. Before turning the call over to Alex, I would like to provide additional context on the effects of tariffs on the U.S. and global PV markets. In December 2012, during the Obama-Biden administration, the United States imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties after determining that domestic crystalline silicon industry was materially injured by imports of crystalline silicon cells and modules that were sold at less than fair value and subsidized by the government of China. In March 2019, the United States continues these tariffs. They\u2019re also a second set of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese crystalline silicon modules with non-Chinese sales. Those duties were imposed in 2015 and in 2020, they were continued. Given the tariffs only applied to a portion of crystalline silicon supply chain, Chinese manufacturers added cell and modules capacity in nearby countries in Southeast Asia. Today with this adjustment to their supply chain, our crystalline silicon competitors, they not only avoid these tariffs, but also continued to use government subsidized polysilicon, ingots and wafers manufactured in China. Separately, in February of 2018 during the Trump administration, the U.S. imposed Section 201 tariffs on imported crystalline silicon cells and modules from most countries with limited exceptions over a four year period. However, between June 2019 and November 2020, an exemption from Section 201 tariffs was granted for crystalline silicon bifacial modules. This exclusion enabled Chinese solar companies with bifacial cells and modules assembled in Southeast Asia to avoid the Section 201 tariffs as well as the anti-dumping and countervailing duties, while they\u2019re still using subsidized polysilicon and ingots and wafers from China. Despite access by the United States in India, most global markets have allowed unencumbered access of government subsidized panels from China resulting in PV Academy and global goals that are largely hold into a single technology supply chain and country. We believe our differentiated technology and advantage cost structure and a balance perspective on growth liquidity and profitability has enabled and will continue to enable us to succeed in the global marketplace, despite the lack of fair trade. As the only alternative to crystalline silicon technology among the 10 largest solar module manufacturers globally, First Solar provides domestic supply security and enables the United States and global markets to reduce their over-reliance on imported panels from China. We remain hopeful for a future where both free and fair trade can be established in the PV industry. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Alex who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Starting on Slide 7, I\u2019ll cover the income statement highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $609 million decreased to $318 million compared to the prior quarter. This was primarily a result of higher international project sales in Q3, partially offset by increased module volumes sold in Q4. For the full year 2020, net sales were $2.7 billion compared to $3.1 billion in 2019. But for guidance expectations, net sales were within, but towards the lower end of our guidance range. This result was primarily caused by factory shutdown on Q3 earnings call, which included the timing of the Sun Streams 2 project sale. To a lesser extent, net sales also impacted by certain modules deliveries that were delayed due to COVID-19 related events, including a positive case at a customer construction site, which resulted in a temporary shutdown and a shipping vessel containing First Solar modules that was diverted from its intended destination due to a positive case on the vessel. The percentage of total quarterly sales, our module revenue in the fourth quarter was 90% compared to 46% in the third quarter. For the full year 2020, 64% of net sales were from our module business compared to 48% in 2019. Gross margin was 26% in the fourth quarter compared to 32% in the third quarter. And for the full year 2020 gross margin was 25% compared to 18% in 2019. Systems segment revenue was $61 million in the fourth quarter compared to $505 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter systems revenue was lower than anticipated primarily due to the delay in the sale of the Sun Streams 2 project. System segment gross margin was 18% in the fourth quarter compared to 33% in the third quarter. And fourth quarter was positively impacted by $9 million benefits associated with a reduction in estimated liquidated damages for legacy EPC projects with increased systems on gross margin by 14%. For the full year, system segment gross margin was 26% compared to 16% in 2019. The module segment gross margin was 27% in the fourth quarter compared to 30% in the third quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter was impacted by a reduction in our product warranty liability reserve, a reduction on module collection and recycling liability and impairments of certain module manufacturing equipment for tools no longer compatible with our long-term technology roadmap. On a net basis, these factors increased Q3 module segment gross margin by 5 percentage points. Also as a reminder, sales rate warranty are included in our cost of sales and reduced module segment gross margin by 7% in the fourth quarter compared to 6% in Q3. Despite utilizing contracted routes, minimizing changes and the use of the distribution center, we incurred higher rates during the fourth quarter for a portion of our module deliveries due to constrained container viability in the global shipping market. With this context in mind, we\u2019re pleased with our Q4 module segment gross margin results, which achieved our guidance expectation. The full year module segment gross margin of 25%, compared to 20% in 2019. Full year 2020 module segment gross margin included $20 million of severance and decommissioning costs and $4 million of ramp expense, which in the aggregate reduced module segment gross margin by 1.4%. From a fleet wide perspective, as a result of our continued manufacturing execution costs of what\u2019s sold at the end of 2020 met our target at a 10% decline at the end of 2019. SG&A, R&D and production start up was $102 million in the fourth quarter and increased approximately $16 million relative to the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in production startup expense from $13 million in Q3 to $17 million in Q4, $9 million of development project with impairment charges in Q4 and a $7 million increase in incentive compensation expense relative to our guidance expectations, partially offset by the cost savings. With this context in mind, we\u2019re pleased with operating expense result relative to our fourth quarter guidance range of $90 million to $95 million. SG&A, R&D and startup totaled $357 million in 2020 compared to $348 million in 2019. Included in the full year 2020 OpEx was $41 million of production startup expense, $12 million of development project impairment charges, $7 million of severance charges, $6 million of class action and opt-out action legal fees, $3 million of expected credit losses on our accounts receivable as a results of the economic disruption caused by COVID 19 and $2 million of retention compensation expense. Combined with litigation losses of $6 million, total operating expenses were $363 million for full year 2020. Operating income of $58 million in Q4 and $317 million for the full year 2020. We recorded a tax benefit of $66 million in the fourth quarter, which included a discreet tax benefit of $61 million associated with closing of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax position. For the full year, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $107 million, full year net benefit from the CARES Act approximately $84 million and $24 million related to the release of evaluation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction. During the fourth quarter with in equity and earnings, we report a full impairment of approximately $3 million related to one of our equity method investments. Fourth quarter earnings per was $1.08 compared to $1.45 in the prior quarter. For the full year 2020 earnings per share was $3.73 compared to the loss to share of $1.09 in 2019. Next turn to Slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and some of the cash flow information. Our cash and cash equivalent, restricted cash and marketable securities balance at year end was $1.8 billion, an increase of $123 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash position, which includes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities net debt at year end was $1.5 billion, an increase of $105 million from the prior quarter. Our net cash balance is higher than our guidance, due to a lower than expected project spend on U.S. international development projects. The timing of cash payments to CapEx delayed the first quarter and improved collections on module sale agreement. Note, the contemplate payment structure, the timing of the Sun Streams 2 project sale did not have any significant impact on our year-end cash balance relative to our guidance. Cash flow from operations were $37 million in 2020 compared to $174 million in 2019. Cash flow from operations in 2020 and clear the previously disclosed payments that the class action opt-out litigation settlements $369 million and a decrease in module prepayments following an increase in Q4 2019 associated with ITC safe harbor module purchase orders. Also as a reminder, when we sell an asset and project level debt is assumed by the buyer, the operating cash flow associated with the sale is less than if the buyer had not assumed the debt. In 2020 buyers by projects assumed $137 million debt rate from these transactions. Capital expenditures were $89 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $106 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $417 million in 2020 compared to $669 million in 2019. Before I turn the call back over to Mark, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the strategic review of our U.S. project development North American O&M businesses. As recently announced, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our U.S. product development platform to Leeward Renewable Energy, the portfolio company of over the infrastructure. Basically you want to follow the comprehensive multi-phase process were more than 160 parties were either contact or expressed inbound interest when multiple structures were considered. Based on the extensive nature of this process and the offers that we received, we believe this transaction represents the most compelling option. We\u2019re pleased with the platform will be acquired by Leeward at almost the entirety of our US-based product development team as expected to join Leeward upon closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2021 after obtaining regulatory approval and satisfying customer closing conditions. Subject to closing the acquisition Leeward will sign 1.8 gigawatts of module purchase orders of which 744 megawatts represent new bookings. Well, approximately 0.4 gigawatts are included in the upfront purchase price, the remaining approximately 1.4 gigawatt of modules are expected to be added to our contracted backlog and expected to be recognized as future module segment. As previously noted, our U.S. product development sale announcement, we stated that we intended to retain 1.1 gigawatt AC of U.S.-based projects that we plan to sell separately. After this announcement, we closed the sale of our Sun Streams 2 project, signed agreements to sell up Sun Streams 4 and 5 and are in late stage negotiations to sell our Sun Streams 3, which totaled 750 megawatts AC. The remaining projects are uncontracted and expected to be sold in 2021. As it relates to the sale of our North America O&M business to NovaSource Power Services, a portfolio company of Clairvest Group, although we initially expected the sale of this business to close in the fourth quarter of 2020 certain conditions to closing remain outstanding. We expect these remaining conditions to be satisfied and the transaction to close in the first half of 2021. I\u2019ll later discuss the financial impact of these transactions during the guidance portion of today\u2019s call. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark to provide a business strategy update. Mark Widmar : All right. Thank you, Alex. As our company\u2019s founding Over 20 years ago, the PV industry has been through periods of rapid growth, declining costs and technology evolution. We\u2019re one of the few solar companies that both entered and exited this last decade. We have continued to adapt our business model to remain competitive and differentiated in a constantly evolving market. For example, our original assets into O&M and EPC and project development was to address an unmet need of the market and capture a profit pool. Our acceleration of Series 6 production was a competitive response to address the current market condition. Despite these transformation among others, our core identity as a module manufacturing company with a differentiated CadTel technology has remained constant. As we look into the future with a more focused business model, our pace of innovation will be critical to our competitive strengths, enabling us to leverage our points of differentiation and capture compelling value for our technology. CuRe, cell crackling warranty, and responsible solar strategy are recent examples of innovations enhancing our competitive position in the market. The market momentum for PV continues to build. Our Series 6 energy, quality and environmental advantages are all key demonstrators, which we believe we\u2019ll enable us to meaningfully participate in this wave of demand for clean and affordable energy. Based on the growth of selected people markets and our competitive advantages, we believe we can grow our manufacturing capacity while still selling our products into regions where our technology has points of differentiation. Within this context, Slide 9 provides an updated view of our global potential bookings opportunity, which now totals 19.7 gigawatts across early to late-stage opportunities through 2023. In terms of segment mix, this pipeline of opportunities is exclusively third-party module sales. In terms of geographical breakdown, North America remains the region with the large number of opportunities at 14.9 gigawatts. Europe represents 2.3 gigawatts. India represents 1.8 gigawatts with the remainder in other geographies. A subset of this opportunity set is at mid- to late-stage booking opportunities of 12.6 gigawatts, which reflects those opportunities we feel could book within the next 12 months, and includes the aforementioned 1.4 gigawatts of contracted volume subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent. This subset includes approximately 10.2 gigawatts in North America, 1.2 gigawatts in India, 0.9 gigawatts in Europe of which 0.7 gigawatts is based in France and the remainder in other geographies. This opportunity set coupled with our contracted backlog gives us confidence as we continue scaling our manufacturing capacity. Turning to Slide 10, as we\u2019ve continued to drive additional throughput, increased average watts per module and improved manufacturing yield, our Series 6 production exited 2020 with nameplate capacity manufacturing of approximately 6.3 gigawatts split between 4.1 gigawatts at our international factories in Vietnam and Malaysia and 2.2 gigawatts in Ohio. With the commence production at our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia, our global manufacturing footprint increases to six factories. At the end of 2021, we anticipate increasing nameplate capacity to 8.7 gigawatts, which includes 2.6 gigawatts of capacity in Ohio and 6.1 gigawatts across four factories in Malaysia and Vietnam. This 2.4 gigawatts in incremental year-over-year capacity is reflective of our new Malaysia factory and expected improvements in average watts per module and throughput across the fleet. By the end of 2022, we anticipate increasing throughput by 12% compared to our rebated throughput entitlement and expect continued improvements in our average watts per module and manufacturing yield. Accordingly, by the end of the year, we anticipate increasing our fleet-wide nameplate manufacturing capacity to 9.4 gigawatts, which includes 2.7 gigawatts of capacity in Ohio and 6.7 gigawatts across our international factories. This 0.7 gigawatts anticipated incremental capacity is expected to come from optimization of our existing footprint. As previously highlighted, we are evaluating the potential for future capacity expansion and they think to further diversify our manufacturing presence. In addition to the factors we\u2019ve previously highlighted, we\u2019re also evaluating domestic and international policies to ensure any such expansion as well-positioned. While we have made no such decisions at this time, any Greenfield capacity additions are unlike contribute to our 2022 production plan. From our production perspective, in 2021, we expect to produce approximately 7.4 to 7.6 gigawatts, which is within the 7.3 to 7.7 gigawatts range, we provide at this time the last February guidance call. Note, our second Malaysia factory will continue as ramp period through the end of the first quarter and we are planning for over three weeks of downtime across the fleet to implement technology and throughput upgrades. In 2022, with the addition of the fully ramped factory in Malaysia and ongoing improvements across the fleet, we expect to produce 8.6 to 9.0 gigawatts. Turning to Slide 11, I will now provide an update on our technology roadmap. Over the course of 2020, we\u2019ve made steady progress in our technology roadmap and in the year with a top bin of 445. Early in 2021, we have demonstrated continued progress increasing our fleet wide average per module to 444. For February month-to-date and for our new Malaysia factory introduced our Series 6 plus module, the next phase of our technology roadmap with a current top bin of 450 watts. Leveraging our existing Series 6 toolset, we increased our module form factor by approximately 2% and increased our module efficiency, which has increased our top bin production by approximately 10 watts. Note, after our second Malaysia factory ramp is completed, we anticipate our top bin will be 455 watts. Importantly, this increase in form factoring is sized to reduce balance of system cost per watt by adding module wattage, without material changes to the installation process or support structure. We anticipate implementing Series 6 plus across the fleet over the course of 2021. From our manufacturing cost perspective, we expect this additional wattage reduce our costs and sales straight freight per watt, which I will later discuss. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we anticipate commencing initial production of our copper replace Series 6 or CuRe on our lead line production. As previously disclosed, this program is expected to not only increase module wattage, but also meaningfully improve lifetime energy performance. Accordingly, by the end of 2021, we anticipate our top production bin will reach 460 to 465 with an expected 30-year warranty degraded rate, approximately 50% below our existing baseline. Given PV power plants have an expected useful life of up to 40 years, our reduction in a module is long-term degradation is expected to be a material benefit to project economics, as it increases energy density of the module and life cycle energy generation. As demonstrated on Slide 12, we believe that benefits of improved module efficiency and temperature coefficient will result in a 7% higher energy density in the first year for our 465 watt CuRe module compared to our 440 watts Series 6 module. Due to the expected reduction in our CuRe modules long-term degradation rate, we expect is improvement can increase to 20% in year 40, which represents a 13% improvement over the life of the asset. As we stated previously, we believe CuRe\u2019s significantly increases Series 6s competitiveness against bifacial modules. As a point of reference, bifacial modules generate in an estimate of 4% to 8% more energy than comparable monofacial modules. More importantly, CuRe\u2019s energy uplift does not increase the module or balance assistant cost as typically seen with bifacial modules. By the end of the first quarter of 2022, we anticipate the entire fleet will be converted to CuRe. This is anticipated to provide additional benefits to our average watts per module and cost per watt. Through the implementation of our copper replacement program combined with our ongoing R&D program, we\u2019re aiming to achieve a top production bin of 475 to 480 watts by the end of 2022. Note, on our second quarter earnings call, we stated that we expected a 480 watt module bin 2023. With a CdTe cell efficiency entitlement in an excess of 25%, we see a path to significantly increase our module outage and efficiency in the midterm. With this path to increase efficiency coupled with our degradation, spectral response and temperature coefficient energy advantages and vertically integrated manufacturing processes, we believe the outlook for our technology remains well positioned in a global PV market. Finally, we continue to focus on advanced research and development under evaluating the potential to move beyond a single junction device and leverage the high-band gap advantages of CdTe in a multi-junction device. A multi-junction device has the potential to be disruptive high efficiency, low cost module within advantage energy generation profile. Well, the evaluation for this technology is in early development, we are aiming to utilize many of the product enhancements in our existing CdTe roadmap. Turning to Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some context around our module cost per watt, as initially presented on our guidance call in February 2020, we forecasted a Series 6 cost per watt reduction of 10% between where we expected to end 2020 and the end of 2019, despite unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic pricing pressures and the global shipping market and rising commodity costs, including aluminum, which we mitigated in part through a hedge structure and increased demand for PV glass, we executed on our cost per watt roadmap for the year and achieved this target. Looking into 2021, I\u2019d like to start by addressing how we intend to manage key bill of material and sales freight costs. Firstly, given our module utilizes CdTe chemistry, our cost per watt is unaffected by fluctuations in polysilicon pricing. Secondly, from the glass perspective, growing solar demand and the emergence of bifacial modules have continued to put pressure on the supply and cost of PV glass. However, our glass procurement strategy primarily relies on forward contracts and localization of glass supply. In 2021, we intend to further localize our glass needs domestically in the United States and Malaysia through long-term supply agreements. This strategy enables us to mitigate the cost of variable spot pricing for glass and inbound freight. Thirdly, from a sales freight perspective, utilizing contracted routes and minimizing changes helped alleviate some of the impact of higher spot rates in 2020 in the first quarter of 2021. Despite higher shipping rates expected in 2021, we intend to utilize our distribution center strategy to mitigate some of these events. Note, we expect sales freight and warranty to produce module segment gross margin by 7 to 8 percentage points in 2021, compared to 7 percentage points in 2020. Finally, as part of our Series 6 plus implementation, we anticipate a reduction in the module profile by reducing the thickness of our frame and junction box. In addition to reducing the bill of material costs, we anticipate this development will enable us to increase modules per shipping container by approximately 10%. As it relates to our Ohio manufacturing facilities, despite exiting 2020 with a higher cost per watt in comparison to our international factories, we have displayed significant improvements in 2021 through the following initiatives. Firstly, in the fourth quarter, the manufacturing yield was 96%, which was below the fleet average. We anticipate this will improve to 97% by the end of 2021, which provides a benefit to our fixed and variable costs per module. Secondly, we anticipate increase in our nameplate manufacturing capacity to 2.6 gigawatts by the end of the year, an increase of 18% compared to the end of 2020. Finally, our cover glass facility in Illinois started in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a float glass facility in Ohio started in the first quarter of 2021 and we\u2019ll supply our Ohio factory. We anticipate this will provide a benefit to the variable portion of our cost per watt. With the implementation of these key initiatives among others, we anticipate our Ohio cost per watt headwind relative to our international factories will exit 2021 $0.02 per watt higher, including sales freight. On a fleet wide basis, relative to where we exited 2020, we anticipate reducing our cost per watt produce by 11% by the end of 2021, due to the ramp and underutilization costs related to the affirmation factory ramp upgrades and challenges related to sales freight, we anticipate reducing our cost per watt sold by 8% by the end of the year. As we look beyond the midterm, I would like to revisit the five key levers that we believe will enable us to continue to reduce in our cost per watt. Starting with efficiency, we anticipate increasing our top production bin from 445 in December 2020, a top production bin of 475 to 480 watts by the end of 2022. With a midterm goal of 500 watts per module, we see the potential for continued improvement in our module performance. Improvements in module watts generally provide a benefit to each component of the cost per watt, including our variable and fixed bill of materials and sales freight in warranty costs. Secondly, by the end of 2022, we anticipate increasing throughput by 12% compared to our rerated capacity utilization baseline to the implementation of the additional tools and debottlenecking efforts. This drives additional throughput on our existing manufacturing footprint resulting in the fixed cost solution benefit. Thirdly, while we\u2019ve made steady improvements to our manufacturing yield over the course of 2020 achieving 97.6% in December, we anticipate a fleet wide yield of 97.5% in 2021. While our international factories have achieved yield, in excess of 98%, the plant upgrades for Series 6 plus and CuRe are expected to impact yield performance during the year. However, in the midterm, we see a path to increase our fleet-wide manufacturing yield to 98.5%. Fourthly, we see midterm opportunities to reduce our bill of material costs by 20% to 25%, primarily across our glass and frame. Finally, we believe the combination of sending our module profile and transportation optimization can lead to a 15% reduction in freight costs. Combining the benefits of our CuRe and our other R&D work with aforementioned cost levers, we believe we are strongly positioned to continue to drive Series 6 cost per watt efficiency and energy improvements over the near and midterm. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Alex, who will discuss our financial outlook and provide 2021 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before discussing our 2021 financial guidance, I\u2019d like to highlight our core [indiscernible], which is endeavor to create shareholder value through a disciplined decision-making framework that balances growth, liquidity and profitability. As it relates to growth, we anticipate increasing our nameplate manufacturing capacity to 9.4 gigawatts by the end of 2020, driven by the addition of our second factory in Malaysia and ongoing improvements in average watts to module throughput manufacturing yield. As Mark previously highlighted, we\u2019re evaluating potential future capacity expansion and may do so beyond our existing geographic footprint. Strong booking performance in 2020 and year-to-date 2021 and current forward contract position of 13.7 gigawatts gives us commercial confidence as we evaluate the potential for incremental expansion. Our liquidity position has been a strategic differentiator in an industry that has historically prioritized growth without regard to long-term capital structure. For example, one of the few solar companies that both enter the next to the last decade and our strong balance sheet has enabled us to weather periods of volatility and also pursue growth opportunities. Additionally, we were able to self-fund our Series 6 transition whilst maintaining our strong liquidity position, ending 2020 with $1.5 billion of net cash. And just to say, we\u2019ll be able to continue to self-fund future capacity expansion and strategic investments from our technology whilst maintaining a strong differentiated balance sheet, which we believe is meaningful competitive differentiator. From our profitability perspective, contracted backlog provides increased visibility into future sales, reduces financial exposure to spot pricing for PV module, helps align our capacity with future demand. Accordingly, we can be selective with our bookings opportunities and contract module sales at pricing levels that fairly value our energy advantage products and provide an acceptable profit per watt. For example, in 2022, although there remains significant uncontracted volume yet to book, the ASP across the aforementioned 5.9 gigawatts of volume for potential deliveries in 2022 is only 10% lower than that of the 7.2 gigawatts of volume to be shipped in 2021. With a target of 11% reduction in cost per watt produced between year-end 2020 and year-end 2021, we believe there\u2019s an opportunity to capture and attract as much. So with this context in mind, I will next discuss the assumptions included in our 2021 financial guidance. Please turn to Slide 14. As it relates to our U.S. project development business, we anticipate that the transaction will close in the first half of 2021, the expected proceeds of approximately $270 million, included in this price of $390 million \u2013 sorry 390 megawatts of Series 4 and Series 6 for solar module, the 10 gigawatt project pipeline, including the five contracted development projects, the 30 megawatt operational Berea project, and certain other Safe Harbor equipment. On closing, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain on sale showed on the income statement between the gross margin and operating income line of approximately $25 million. As it relates to our North American O&M business, we anticipate the transaction will also close in the first half of 2021. And upon closing, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain on sale of approximately $115 million. We believe that closing these transactions will be a positive result for both our U.S. project development and North American O&M associates. As of the end of 2020, we had approximately 300 associates audited our North American O&M and U.S. project development businesses collectively. And at closing substantially, all of these associates will join Leeward and NovaSource respectively. As we active in North American O&M and U.S. project development, we see the potential for significant cost reduction from this decision, which is reflected in both the cost of sales and operating expenses lines. As we\u2019ve mentioned in prior earnings calls, including Q3 of 2019 and as is also the case in Q4 of 2020 in courses with low project development revenue, we see an adverse impact to the system segment gross margin due to the fixed cost burden that sits in the cost of sales line. Similarly for the O&M business, the majority of the non-direct project related costs to support the O&M business sit within the cost of sales line. In total, in 2021, we expect to see approximately $15 million in annual cost of sale savings associated with the sale of the North American O&M business. So that additional approximately $5 million of savings in 2022, we expect run rate annual savings approximately $20 million from the sales in [Audio Dip] The sale of the U.S. project development business is expected to result in approximately $35 million of savings in 2021 and an additional $10 million to $15 million of run rate savings in 2022 for a total annualized benefit from 2022 onwards to approximately $45 million to $50 million, of which approximately 60% sits in the operating expenses line. From a systems perspective remaining in our 2021 cost structure are approximately $15 million of expenses associated with our Japanese development business, split between operating expense and cost of sales and approximately $15 million of cost of sales associated with our power generating assets. For the book backlog, system backlog of approximately 200 megawatts AC of systems projects in Japan in a strong path to position will lead that as an opportunity to capture an attractive profit pool around. Next, our 2021 shipments expected to be between 7.8 and 8 gigawatts, which exceeds our production plan for the year of 7.4 to 7.6 gigawatts. There are several factors driving this. Firstly, we produced approximately 1.6 gigawatts in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our guidance from the third quarter earnings call by about 120 megawatts. Secondly, in the fourth quarter, we shipped 1.8 gigawatts, which is a 100 megawatts below the midpoint of our guidance range. And finally, we expect to ship approximately 150 megawatts of Series 6 modules as part of the U.S. project development transaction to a previously intended to Safe Harbor, the 26% investment tax credit. Our ongoing Series 6 throughput and technology programs are expected to impact 2021 operating income by $60 million to $70 million. This is comprised of $5 million to $10 million of ramp expenses incurred of our second factory in Malaysia, which we anticipate will exit as ramp period by the end of Q1. As previously mentioned, we have fleet-wide factory upgrade to incorporate Series 6 plus, CuRe and throughput improvements in 2021. The upgrades will require approximately three weeks of downtime across the fleet, resulting in estimating underutilization losses of $40 million and production start-up expense of $15 million to $20 million. We anticipate these improvements will contribute meaningfully to our 8.69 gigawatt production plan in 2022. As it relates to domestic capital markets and financing, the significant utility scale of solar and wind capacity additions expected in 2021 with co-located battery storage increasing many projects for ITC eligible basis, demands for tax equity is at this time expected to remain high. A financial guidance assumes the bank profitability will be sufficient to supply the needs of the tax equity market, or if market conditions deteriorate and appropriate legislative solution, such as the ability to receive direct cash payments in lieu of investment tax credit is implemented. And finally, to-date we\u2019ve largely managed the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. And it does not have significant impacts on our operations. Our guidance accordingly and seem to continue to be able to mitigate any such impacts on our supply chain operation without the incurrence of material costs. I will now cover the 2021 guidance ranges on Slide 15. Our net sales guidance is between $2.85 billion and $3 billion, which include $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion of module segment revenue, included in our systems revenue guidance as the sales of Sun Streams two project, which closed in Q1. Gross margin is expected to be between $710 million and $775 million, which includes $580 million to $625 million of module segment gross margin. Module segment gross margin includes a combined $45 million to $50 million of ramp expense and underutilization losses, which were expected to reduce module segment gross margin by approximately two percentage points. Additionally, sales freight and warrants are included in the cost of sale and expected to reduce multiple segment gross margin by seven to eight percentage points. In the United States, we\u2019re seeing some weather related impacts to module deliver rescheduled resulting from last week\u2019s storm particular in Texas. Whilst we\u2019re in the process of balancing customers\u2019 project needs and contractual commitments, we anticipate this will impact our Q1 shipment. However, with lower Q1 sales volume and improving cost per watt profile over the course of the year, we anticipate our module 7 gross module increase from 19% in the first quarter to 26% in the fourth quarter. Approximately one-third of our fully around and underutilization charges are expected to be incurred during the first quarter with the remainder split evenly across the subsequent to three quarters. The board knows that our sellable volume in 2021 is predominantly Series 6 and Series 6 plus, which is competing for business against bifacial technology. Whilst we are incurring ramp and utilization costs this year to integrate our CuRe technology, we expect to begin realizing the value associated with these improvements in 2022. SG&A and R&D expenses that are expected to total $270 million to $280 million, included in SG&A approximately $5 million of transaction costs related to the sale of our U.S. project development business. Operating expenses, which includes $15 million to $20 million of production start-up expense are expected to be between $285 million and $300 million Operating income is estimated to be between $545 million and $640 million, and is inclusive of an expected approximately $140 million gain on sale related to the aforementioned O&M and project development transactions and $60 million to $70 million of combined ramp and underutilization costs and plus start-up expenses. Turning to non-operating items, we expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to negative $10 million. Full year tax expense forecast to be a $100 million to $120 million, which includes approximately $35 million of tax expense related to the North America O&M and U.S. project development sales transactions. This results next full year 2021 earnings per share guidance range for $4.05 to $4.75. And now we expect earnings per share of approximately $1 related to the gains on sale by U.S. project development and North American O&M businesses. Capital expenditures in 2021 are expected to range from $425 million to $475 million, as we complete the transition to our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia, increased throughput, our existing Series 6 facilities, implement Series 6 plus and CuRe and invest in other R&D related program. Our year end 2021 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. The increase in our 2020 year end net cash balance is primarily to operating cash flows on module business, proceeds from our U.S. project development and North American O&M sales, which we expect will partial offset by capital expenditures. Turning to Slide 16 and I\u2019ll summarize the key messages from today\u2019s call. We continue to make significant progress in our Series 6 transition plus from a demand and supply perspective. Series 6 demand within robust with 3.3 gigawatts of net bookings from previous earnings call additional 1.4 gigawatt of volume contracted subject to conditions precedent. Our opportunity pipeline continues to grow with a global opportunity set of 19.7 gigawatts including mid to late-stage opportunities of 12.6 gigawatts. On the supply side, we continued to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to increase on nameplate Series 6 manufacturing capacity to 8.7 gigawatts by year end 2021 and 9.4 gigawatts by year end 2022. In 2021, we expect to produce 7.4 to 7.6 gigawatts of Series 6 volume, a year-over-year increase of 25% to 29%. We see significant midterm opportunity for improvements to our module efficiency costs and energy metrics. We ended 2020 with full year EPS of $3.73, and forecasting full year 2021 earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.75. And finally, we expect the close of sale of our North American O&M and U.S. project development businesses in the first half of 2021. And with that, we\u2019ll conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH. Your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. You\u2019ve shown some healthy bookings a year-to-date, given the forced labor issue ramping up. Can you talk about how recent conversations with customers having shaping up and perhaps how they\u2019ve shifted as well? And then looking out to 2022, when do you expect that could become fully booked? It looks like you\u2019re two-thirds there and then what about the outlook for 2023? And then in terms of your recent bookings, you talked about, I think a 10% reduction in pricing from 2020 levels, which might suggest that your 2022 bookings that you gained or booked recently are in the $0.30 per watt. So I was wondering if you could comment on that or if they might be closer to the mid-$0.20s per watt, which is I think certainly and possible in what some market participants have been sharing with us in terms of market pricing for crystalline silicon. So I know there\u2019s lot there. Thank you very much for the questions. Mark Widmar : All right. So I help to get on them all three of them. With on booking, we\u2019re real happy with the momentum. And just, if you even look at the mid to late-stage opportunities for that \u2013 we expected that opportunities, which we could close within the next year with north of 12 gigawatts sitting there. The momentum we\u2019re starting off with right now, we expect 2022 to be a very strong booking year. As it relates to the discussion and comment around implications of forced labor. I think we try to hit on some of those themes of and it\u2019s probably just interesting one particular issue, but it goes back to this concept that we refer to as responsible solar. And there clearly are a number of counterparties and customers that we engage within conversations that are one concern about over-reliance, concern about maybe the current state of political relationships between the U.S. and China or India and China or other markets as well. And as a result of that, they\u2019re looking for alternatives and one thing that\u2019s great about, first of all, not only do we have great technology and great capabilities, but having, a different standard, which we hold ourselves accountable for. And we have different value attributes that we can provide to our customers. And certainty is one and dealing with a counterparty or a supplier was a different, they themselves, from an integrity and ethical standard to the highest levels. I think it\u2019s important and it\u2019s starting to come into the bookings and what we\u2019ve started to see now in the pipeline that we have. So Phil is one of many, I think there\u2019s still a lot of people, they\u2019re trying to understand the whole forced labor and how it plays out and what the potential implications are around it. But what I will tell you is that some of end customers that we have, not referring to here as the IPP or developer or VPC, but others that are more the off-take agreements, they\u2019re very concerned in some cases they\u2019re incorporating conditions within their procurement criteria to ensure that there\u2019s zero tolerance for forced labor and not only the models of which are being procured and utilized in the project they may have in the U.S. or somewhere else, internationally. They want to make sure that, that their suppliers also have zero tolerance and there\u2019s nowhere through their entire supply chain. Do they tolerate a forced labor? And that makes it very hard as you know, with the complexity of business silicon supply chain to make those types of new assertions and new representation. As it relates to our goals. And I\u2019ll be very transparent of goals. I\u2019m not going to give you a discreet timing, but we clearly want to be, as we exit this year, our is goal we want to be sold out at 2022. We want to be more than halfway sold out at 2023 and have a meaningful proportion of our 2024 volumes contract. So and when you look at where we are right now, and as you\u2019ve indicated, we\u2019re pretty in pretty good position for 2022. We used to clearly have more work to do. And I keep telling them our Chief Commercial Officer, let\u2019s keep selling and keep selling and taking the opportunities that we can. And it\u2019s good to see the pipeline and the robustness and resiliency that we have that hopefully gets us to that goal of accomplishing that because by the time we exit the year. And that was clearly would put us at a much higher than we historically have tried to say, let\u2019s maintain that a one-to-one sold to book ratio and that will be accomplished. That will be much higher than our historical one-to-one. And at least where we sit right now, we feel confident we can get that. ASPs, what I\u2019ll say, Phil around that is, I mean, if you look at the Q, when it comes out or the K in this case, I think it\u2019s going to come out with an average of like $30.80 or something like that. The metrics are going to tell you that. I wouldn\u2019t say that, we\u2019re starting to see increase in ASP, we wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s necessarily reflected what we\u2019re seeing. And we are starting to see independents in each year of which we\u2019re booking out into ASP is starting to firm up and maybe we\u2019ll start to see some resiliency in the upward direction. But we\u2019re at \u2013 like I said, we sat on the call is we\u2019re very pleased and happy with the ASPs that we\u2019ve been able to capture relative value we create in our technology, and then the opportunity to continue to improve overall cost reduction roadmap, maintain a solid gross margin. But more importantly, as you look at year-over-year, we\u2019re growing in our capacity and our sole dimes will be up significantly year-on-year as well, but all sort of creates contribution margin that helps expand operating income. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Lee : Thanks for taking the questions. I had to hear, I guess, first, Mark, can you \u2013 of the 1.1 gigawatts assistance, I think you talked about this, but how much is targeted to be sold this year, next year, and then presumably 2023 will be the last year where you see some systems business revenue, and how much in that year? And then the gross margins, I know, they depend a lot on mix, but it seems like if we back up the components where you\u2019re doing pretty well, it\u2019s about a high-single-digit, low-teens number implied for this year. Is that going to be kind of the go-forward margin level? I would\u2019ve thought it\u2019d be a little bit higher given Sun Streams made it into 2021 versus 2020, but any thoughts around mix implications for margins and how to think about margins for that business as you still have some revenue to monetize over the next couple of years. Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : Yes. I\u2019ll take the first one, Brian, and I\u2019ll let Alex takes the \u2013 those questions on gross margin. As relates to the systems business, the 1.1 is largely the U.S. assets that we still have. Sun Streams has contracted. The rest of the Sun Streams is complex, we\u2019ve signed, but we haven\u2019t finalized what portion we signed up \u2013 another portion hasn\u2019t signed yet. But the plan would have all that done, hopefully by the end of the quarter. And now it takes the largest portion of the U.S. volumes that aggregates up to on an AC basis. I don\u2019t know, 600 megawatts or something like that. And there\u2019s another few hundred megawatts that\u2019s left in the U.S., which our plan would be to move forward as quickly as possible. And ideally, we have all of that sold out by the end of this year. So those are just development sites of which we would then try to contract module uptake agreements too. But the goal for the U.S. stuff would be to monetize all that volume this year and in sooner, the better. The development team is going with the transaction. So we don\u2019t have the capabilities really to continue with the development activities. We\u2019ll have to enter into a service agreement effectively forward with Leeward to continue to support those projects until they\u2019re sold down. The balance of it though there is still 200, 300 megawatts of contract in Japan projects and there\u2019s still more, that\u2019s not contracted at this point in time. We have feed in tariffs, but we haven\u2019t actually fully accomplished the permitting process and interconnection and other things that would ultimately also may require for a recollecting of a booking. That volume will be recognized \u2013 most of it will show up in 2023, there\u2019ll be some in 2021 and 2022. But if you look at the CODs on those projects, most of them had 2023 CODs as we currently see them. But as you know, the bookings \u2013 excuse me, the average ASPs on those projects are highly attractive. And so we\u2019ll monetize that over the next three years. And we\u2019ll see if we go beyond that. Again, we still have some more projects with tariffs that we haven\u2019t booked yet that potentially could create more volumes into 2023, maybe even 2024 period. But I\u2019ll let Alex talk about the gross margin. Alex Bradley : Yes. So Brian, if you look at the guidance we gave, total revenue $2.85 billion to $3 million, of that module $2.45 billion to $2.55 billion that implies systems of $400 million to $450 million of revenue. And on the gross margin side, on the $710 million to $785 million company-wide and module $580 million to $625 million, so again implies systems $130 million to $160 million. So if you look those gross margins, it\u2019s 25% to 26% at the company level, systems looks pretty high, but it\u2019s really very limited volume as the systems is in the low 30\u2019s, skewed a little bit by Sun Streams, and then potentially a little bit of Japan coming in backend of the year. But the module that comes in at about 24% to 25%. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing module gross margins for the year. And then as you\u2019re talking about kind of how to look at that going out, we tried to give a little bit of color here. On the gross margin level, we talked about the ASP decline and what we\u2019ve got books, right? And if you look at 2022, there\u2019s clearly still a lot to book in there, but we do have a significant amount of contracted already. And we said, if you look at the ASP decline, 2021 and 2022 goes down about 10% and then cost decline go down 11%. Now those are off different bases, obviously on an ASP and a cost per load. As you can see that we\u2019re getting costs coming down at a slightly better than the ASP decline going from 2021 into 2022 and at the same time, you\u2019re getting some additional volume coming through that scale. On a percentage basis, you get a better benefit there from deletion of the fixed costs that are on absolute dollar basis, you got just the benefit of increased volume coming through there. And then as we talked about before, it matters all started go down to the operating margin levels. So we talked about some of the cost reductions coming out from the sale of the O&M and product development. Some of that comes out in 2021, but there\u2019s also a lack of a little bit that comes out in 2022. So that\u2019s going to see cost of sales and OpEx continuing to reduce as we go into 2022. And that again helps us down to an operating margin level. Mark Widmar : One thing I\u2019ll add to that queue, Brian, Alex mentioned in his comments. There\u2019s a pretty significant headwind in 2021 for under utilization in order to deal with the upgrades that we need to do for primarily for CuRe. So there\u2019s a significant cost, I think it\u2019s about $40 million in total of under utilization that we\u2019ll have to absorb within 2021. So that\u2019s weighing down on the gross margin. I think if you adjust for that, I think the gross margin goes up a couple of percentage points up into that range. Operator : Our final question will come from Ben Kallo with Baird. Your line is open. Ben Kallo : Thank you for making time for me. I kind of want to boil it all down. So, I heard you say, several different things about gross margin improving. You said the ASP\u2019s are firming up, you\u2019re much locked into 2022. So if I go to 2022 EPS should be up right. And then my second question is, I guess, Alex, when you build a new factory, how do you determine whether or not you have the ROIC on that? I guess, there\u2019s probably a margin associated with that. And so you have to have some kind of firm belief in your long-term contracts to invest that money. Those are my two questions. Mark Widmar : Yes. I don\u2019t think, first of all, that Alex said. Ben we\u2019re not giving guidance for 2022 at this point that we gave some pretty strong indicators of what will drive 2022, which will be the volume \u2013 the production volumes as we referenced the new product of CuRe. The one thing I want to keep making sure that it\u2019s representative there is, in all of 2022 volume will be CuRe. If you look at the one slide, which shows the energy uplift, there\u2019s a meaningful energy uplift because of the improvement of long-term degradation. And that we sell energy, we sell back. And so that is important to understand. And we also referenced that there was a lot of interest and rightfully so when bifacial modules came out and they talked about a 4% to 8% energy uplift relative to monofacial modules, similar efficiency. If you look at where we are with our pure product, and on a lifecycle averages, on top of the initial Tesco and efficiency pop there\u2019s another 10 percentage points of lifecycle energy through improvement of long-term degradation. And so you can take our products and even, again crystalline silicon bifacial that maybe even as a nameplate of 150, 175 bps better efficiency. And you\u2019re going to find that over the life cycle energy profile, we\u2019re going to outperform that in the range of call it, anywhere from 4% to 6%. And that\u2019s compiling value fruition. So it\u2019s the technology, it\u2019s the supply improvement, there are production plan improvement that we\u2019re talking about and continued reduction of our own internal costs, I think 2020, we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance, but we gave enough information, I think to help people look because ROIC and then what 2022 should look like. Alex Bradley : And Ben, I think about ROIC, if I look at it across both in individual factor on a company wide basis. If you think about individual factory at a gross margin level depending on what our volume sold is more of it as sold outside the U.S. today. And as we expand, you may see that gross margin level going down, being more challenging from individual factory relatively to the current book volume. But at the same time, adding a factory adds very limited to no OpEx, and also actually have a slight benefit diluting from the fixed costs instead of the cost of sales line. So therefore, on an operating margin benefit of anything that factory could look better. So because it has impacts not just for an individual factory, but also for diluting fixed costs plus the benefit you get call of extra volume with pretty much the same OpEx, given that, as you said before, we think 80% to 90% of operating cost line is fixed. We have to look at it both individually and across the company. But we certainly want to make sure that adding was being significantly cost of capital for adding factories and we\u2019ve seen that today. Operator : We have reached the end of our time for the question-and-answer session. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2021 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2021. Following the remarks we open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by thanking the First Solar team for delivering a solid first quarter. Our operational and financial results were strong and market demand for our Series 6 technology continues to be robust. Operationally our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia exited its ramp period. Nameplate manufacturing capacity has increased to 7.9 gigawatts and we're now consistently producing 455 watt modules. Commercially, we have secured 4.8 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings which include 2.9 gigawatts since previous earnings call. Financially, we reported module segment gross margin in line with our Q1 guidance and earnings per share of $1.96 which includes the completion of our US project development and North American O&M business sales. Overall I'm pleased with our strong start to the year which has positioned us to deliver our annual earnings per share guidance. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide an update on our Series 6 capacity ramp and manufacturing performance. Despite unplanned downtime caused by winter storms in Ohio and a temporary logistic driven billing material shortage in Malaysia along with planned downtime for throughput and technology upgrades which combined adversely impact cost for watt by approximately half a penny. We delivered strong manufacturing results for the first quarter. On a fleet-wide basis in March and in April month-to-date, megawatts produced per day was 20.2 and 22 which represents a 17% and 27% increase compared to December 2020. Capacity utilization was 92% and 99% despite being impacted by the aforementioned planned and unplanned downtime. Manufacturing yield of 96.7% and 97.4% continues to show strength in light of the ramp of our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia, which achieved manufacturing yields of approximately 93% and 97%. As previously mentioned, we started commercial production of our 455 watt module as both our factories in Malaysia and our fleet-wide average watt for module improved to 442 and 445 watts. This manufacturing performance has been a key driver of our cost for watt reduction and gives us further confidence as we execute on our cost reduction roadmap. It's also important to put our recent performance into context. Comparing to April of 2019 to April of 2021, month-to-date our average watt per module has increased by 26 watts. Megawatts produced per day has increased by 144%and manufacturing yield has increased by 9 percentage points. I'm pleased with what the team has accomplished. However, as we drive towards our mid-term goal of 500 watt module increasing throughput by 12% compared to re-rated capacity utilization baseline and increasing manufacturing yield to a mid-term target of 98.5%. We have an opportunity to significantly reduce cost through disciplined manufacturing. As a company, we have demonstrated disciplined execution and agility throughout the startup and ramp of our Series 6 factory including gathering new learning's from each factory rollout and utilizing them in the next. This culture of continuous improvement enables us to increase implementation velocity and reduce our ramp period. While it took our first Series 6 factory in Ohio approximately 22 months to achieve throughput in line with its nameplate entitlement. Our newest factory exited its ramp period in only one month time. The consistent improvement of our factory limitation process gives us operational confidence as we evaluate the potential for future capacity expansions. We believe the combination of a differentiated technology and a balanced business model of growth, liquidity and profitability is a competitive differentiator and will continue to enable our success. Three years ago in April 2018, we commenced commercial production at our first Series 6 factory and today, we have established a Series 6 factory footprint through which we have the potential to reach our 10 gigawatts of nameplate capacity based on our existing efficiency and throughput plans. Looking forward, strong demand for Series 6. A compelling technology roadmap, a strong balance sheet and a largely fixed operating expense cost structure. Our each catalyst as we evaluate the potential for future capacity expansions while we've made no such decision at this time. We are targeting to make a determination by our Q2 earnings call. From the shipping and logistics perspective, experienced by postal [ph] port congestion in the United States along with logistics challenges stemming from February's winter weather events in Southern United States. As a result, certain module deliveries planned for the first quarter were delayed and given ongoing port congestions. We see potential for similar delays in the second quarter which could result in delays in module recognition. While the cost per watt of PV modules has declined significantly in the past decade sales trade has largely remained fixed on absolute dollar basis. As a result, sales trading has become more meaningful percentage of the cost per watt. For example, in Q4 last year and Q1 of this year. Sales freight and warranty reduced our module segment gross margin by 7% and 8% respectively. Note, this highlight for markets with large recurring demand such as the US, India and Europe. The importance of having in-country or in region manufacturing which hence significantly reduce the cost of sales trade. As initially highlighted during our February earnings call, we continue to anticipate elevated shipping rates in 2021. We continue to partially mitigate the impact via the implementation of following initiatives. Firstly, as we improved module efficiency, we benefit from an increase in watt per shipping container and [indiscernible] decline and sales trade for a while. Secondly, as we implement Series 6 plus, we will reduce profile of our frame and junction box by approximately 10% enabling an increase in a number of modules per shipping containers. Thirdly, we intend to expand our distribution network footprint in the United States which we anticipate will increase domestic inventory buffers further reduce exposure to spot shipping rates and provide greater flexibility while reducing shipment timing risk for our customers. Implementation of these initiatives is important in order to help mitigate the effects of the challenging shipping market and achieve our 2021 cost for watt reduction objective. From a supply chain perspective, our strategy emphasizes long-term agreement that reduce exposure to spot pricing for commodities and raw materials. For example, our glass procurement strategy primarily relies on fixed price contracts and partnerships with domestic suppliers. This approach helps de-risk the value of our contracted backlog and provides greater certainty that will be able to meet our expected profitability. Our approach tutorium [ph] is similar, we secure our supply needs through multi-year fixed price agreements whilst driving to reduce CdTe usage per module through optimization of our vapor deposition profits while Tellrium is a key component of our semiconductor material. It is a minor component of our cost per watt given our CdTe thin film is 3% the thickness of a human hair. Also as part of our global high value PV recycling program. We're able to establish a circular economy by recovering more than 90% of the semiconductor material for use in new First Solar modules. Although such recycling on a large scale is still anticipated to be many years out given expected use for lot of modules. This has the potential to significantly reduce our ongoing Tellrium and cadmium needs. In the future, once power plants using First Solar modules reach the end of their useful life. Aluminum which is used in the construction of our frame has recently experienced a price increase to above pre-pandemic levels. Well the head structure we put in place has partially mitigated this impact. We anticipate some cost challenges related to aluminum during the year. However, part of our Series 6 plus implementation we anticipate reducing our frames profile in aluminum usage by 10% which we expect will mitigate a portion of this cost increase. Finally, despite the previously mentioned delays of certain module deliveries in Q2 and a result of our continued manufacturing execution and aforementioned risk reduced supply chain approach. We achieved our module segment gross margin target in Q1. Additionally, by cost of - for certain billing materials, we're tracking to achieve our targeted 11% cost per watt produced reduction between where we ended 2020 and expect to end 2021 while we intend to mitigate much of this impact related to the challenging shifting in market. Our revised target cost per watt sold reduction is 6% to 7%. Turning to Slide 4. In Q1, we completed the sale of our contracted Sun Streams 2 and uncontracted Sun Streams 4 in five projects to Longroad Energy. In April, we completed our uncontracted Sun Streams 3 project to Longroad as well. Across these four projects, Longroad intends to utilize approximately gigawatt of Series 6 modules of which 785 megawatts represent new bookings since the last earnings call. As it relates to our systems business in Japan. Our existing team and competitively advantaged core project development skill set of sitting, permitting, interconnection and securing long-term feed-in tariff contracts has positioned us well in the market. Today, we have an approximately 320 megawatts systems backlog in Japan which includes 55 megawatts of new bookings since the February's earnings call. This backlog is a reflection of our recent success averaging approximately 100 megawatts per year systems booking in Japan between 2018 and 2020. Looking forward in the near term, we have an opportunity to add this backlog with approximately 40 megawatts of Japan's system opportunities with feed-in tariff rights secured as they're pending satisfaction of certain permitting requirements. Across the total portfolio, we have the potential to capture approximately $260 million of gross margin in the next three to five years. With an approximately $15 million per year overhead cost structure. We anticipate the sell down systems projects in Japan will contribute meaningfully to our mid-term operating income. With the national commitment to carbon neutrality and limited domestic source energy generation. The market fundamentals of Japan are favorable to the continuing growth of solar. We continue to build a pipeline of post feed-in tariff opportunities that could target feed-in premiums or corporate PPA opportunities as the market matures. Before discussing our most recent bookings and top line opportunities. I would like to discuss several domestic and international policy updates. At the end of March, President Biden unveiled an infrastructure proposal that emphasized transit, revitalizing power grids and vastly expanding clean energy. While creating millions of jobs and position United States to outcompete China. Additionally the plan is intended to revitalize domestic manufacturing, secure the US supply chain, invest in R&D and train Americans for the job for the future. This is the most far-reaching federal proposal for programs that curb greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change. As the only alternative to crystalline silicon technology among the 10 largest solar module manufacturers globally. With a premier vertically integrated manufacturing process and differentiated CdTe cell technology. We're uniquely positioned to support domestic energy independence in the United States and play a leading role in this plan. We are the largest solar module manufacturing in the United States and directly employee over 1,600 US based associates. Also our domestic supply chain supports thousands of indirect jobs. For example, we procure our float glass from an NSG facility approximately 10 miles from our factory in Perrysburg. Which is the first new float glass line in the United States in 40 years. As a result of this investment, NSG has created long-term and high-quality manufacturing jobs and a domestic supply chain of their own. NSG, soda ash which is the primary material used in glass manufacturing is procured from supplier in Wyoming which is the state that has historically been the largest producer of coal. Pace of innovation is a core to our success. Which starts at R&D lab facilities in Silicon Valley in Ohio? As a reflection of this commitment since our IPO, we have cumulatively invested over $1.4 billion in research and development as the only thin cell module manufacturer of scale. With the manufacturing process that is handled entirely in each of our six factories. We own the end-to-end intellectual property and trade secrets for our CdTe cell technology. We believe the remaining nine largest PV module manufacturers all utilize the same semiconductor material. Additionally, none of these manufacturers are fully integrated relying on varying degrees, on third-party sourcing and intellectual property of upstream polysilicon ingot, wafer and cell manufacturers. While it's difficult to measure the value of the vast subsidies that the Chinese solar industry receives. These subsidies serve to artificially deflate our competitors cost per watt. Resulting in the marketplace that undervalues innovation and where technologies do not compete solely on their own merits. Despite this apparent and outrageous lack of fair trade. The advantages of our vertical integrated manufacturing process and differentiated CdTe cell technology leading to what we believe to be the lowest module manufacturing cost structure in the industry will continue to empower our success. With the Section 201 tariffs currently scheduled to expire in February of 2022, the Biden Administration has a natural window to pursue policies that address the root cause of the problem. China's unfair trade practices. Accordingly, we continue to advocate for and industrial policy that identifies clean tech manufacturing as a national strategic priority to advance US energy independence. We believe that this type of policy would be promoted through incentive by for domestic manufacturing, continued investment in advance, technologies. Closing by American loops and tariff reform. Turning to Slide 5, I'll next discuss our most recent bookings in greater detail. Leading corporate buyers have expressed concerns that due to the decentralized nature of the crystalline silicon supply chain. They're unable to ensure that the solar modules and their systems from which they buy power were not manufacturing use alleged forced labor. While our Series 6 energy quality and environmental advantages are all key differentiators. Customers increasingly are describing value to our vertically integrated manufacturing process, supply chain transparency and zero tolerance for the use of forced labor in our model manufacturing process and supply chain. While the pricing environment remains competitive these catalysts have created bookings momentum for deliveries in 2022, 2023 and beyond with customers seeking to de-risk their projects. Accordingly, we're pleased with our strong year-to-date net bookings of 4.8 gigawatts which includes 2.9 gigawatts since the February earnings call. After accounting for shipments of approximately of 1.8 gigawatts during the first quarter. Our future expected shipment which extended to 2024 are 14.8 gigawatts. Included in our 1.8 gigawatt shipments are approximately 0.2 gigawatts of Series 4 as previously shipped to safe harbor, the Investment Tax Credit. But were transferred to a third-party during the quarter in conjunction with the sale of our US project development business. Accordingly our comparable Q1 shipment number is approximately 1.6 gigawatts including 4.8 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings and 0.4 gigawatts of upside volume related to previously announced purchase order from Intersect Power. We're largely sold out for 2021, have 6.4 gigawatts of potential deliveries in 2022 and 3 gigawatts across 2023 and 2024. Overall the market remains competitive, we're pleased with the pricing levels that we're securing in 2022 and 2023 for our Series 6 plus and CuRe products. Although there remains uncontracted volume yet to be booked the ASP across our aforementioned 6.4 gigawatts of volume for potential deliveries in 2022 is only 11% lower than the volume to be shipped in 2021. Slide 6, provides an updated view of our global potential bookings opportunities. Which now totaled 16.5 gigawatts across early to late phase opportunities through 2024? In terms of geographical breakdown, North America remains the region with largest number of opportunities at 12.9 gigawatts. Europe represents 1.2 gigawatts, India represents 1.2 gigawatts, South America represents 0.7 gigawatts with the remainder in other geographies. As a subset of this opportunity is our mid-to-late-stage bookings opportunity of 7.8 gigawatts which reflects those opportunities we fill could book within the next 12 months. The subset includes approximately 5.4 gigawatts in North America, 1.2 gigawatts in India, 0.6 gigawatts in South America, 0.3 gigawatts in Europe and the remainder in other geographies. Note, this represents victories from our prior earnings call which is largely due to our recent bookings momentum. Finally note, included in the 720 gigawatts is a 1 gigawatt order for US customer that just hours ago we booked. Including this booking in our contract for future shipments. It is just shy of 16 gigawatts. I'll now provide an update on our technology roadmap. As previously disclosed, we launched our Series 6 program leveraging our existing Series 6 toolset which increased our module form factor by approximately 2% and our top production been by approximately 10 watts. Before we implemented this program, at our newest Series 6 factory in Malaysia which is now consistently producing 450 watt modules and we remain on track for fleet-wide implementation of Series 6 plus on the fourth quarter of this year. As previously announced, our Series 6 CuRe modules offer an industry leading 30-year 02% annual warranty variation rate which is up to 60% lower than conventional crystalline silicon product. Additionally, we anticipate improving module efficiency enabling a top production bin of 460 to 465 by the end of 2021. We anticipate this lower degradation rate combined with improved temperature co-efficient and super spectal [ph] response will build upon our existing energy advantages especially in hot and humid climates. As previously indicated, CuRe significantly increased the Series 6 competitiveness against bifacial modules. As a result of the aforementioned advantages as compared to a leading crystalline silicon bifacial module. We estimate that our cure module can produce up to 10% more lifecycle kilowatt hours per kilowatt installed in certain climates with extreme heat and humidity. Finally, we remain on track to implement CuRe and a lead line by the fourth quarter of this year and fleet-wide by the end of the first quarter of next year. As part of our R&D efforts, our CuRe program successfully removes copper from our CdTe vapour deposition process. This enhances the long-term stability of our CuRe modules and based on initial performance in the field and an accelerated live test demonstrates a near zero annual degradation rate. Given PV power plants have useful life of approaching 40 years, a reduction in the annual degradation rate can contribute to meaningfully higher lifetime energy. CuRe along with First Solar's other industry first and only product warranty that specifically covers power loss from cell cracking are recent examples of innovations and enhance our competitive position in the market. Finally, we are continuing to evaluate the potential to leverage the high-band gap advantages of CdTe in a tandem or multi-junction device. A tandem device has the potential to be disruptive high efficiency, low cost an advantage energy generation profile, leveraging many of the innovations in our CdTe cell technology roadmap. Additionally, we believe thin film semiconductor will be the key differentiator to achieve the highest performing tandem PV module. And I'll turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our first quarter financial results and 2021 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Starting on Slide 7, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the first quarter. Net sales in Q1 were $803 million, an increase of $194 million compared to the prior quarter, an increase in that sales is primarily due to an increase in systems revenue driven by the sales of Sun Streams 2, 4 and 5 project. On second basis, our module segment revenue in Q1 was $535 million compared to $548 million in the prior quarter. And that was given assumptions to project within construction at the time of sale, the majority of the module recognized the revenue in the systems segment. Gross margin was 23% in Q1 compared to 26% in Q4 of 2020. Systems segment gross margin was 31% in Q1 compared to 18% in Q4 of 2020 and this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned project sales in Q1. Despite the aforementioned delay in certain module delivery as well as higher expected logistics costs. Our Q1 module segment gross margin was 19% which was in line with the guidance we provided on the prior earnings call. Our module segment gross margin in Q1 includes $1 million of charges associated with the initial ramp from manufacturing in Malaysia and $4 million of underutilization expense stemming from plan downsized throughput technology upgrades. Ramping on the utilization expense in total reduced module 7 gross margin by approximately 1%. Also as a reminder sales freight and warranty are included in our cost of sales and reduced module segment gross margin by 8 percentage points in Q1 compared to 7 and 6 percentage points in Q4 and Q3 of last year. Despite utilizing contracted routes, minimizing changes and using a distribution center, we incurred higher rates during Q1. These are constrained container availability yin the global shipping market. SG&A, R&D and startup totaled $72 million in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately $13 million compared to prior quarter. This decrease is primarily driven by $6 million decrease in development project impairment charges between Q1 and Q4 of 2020 and lower share-based compensation expense in Q1, which was partially offset by $2 million in liquidated damages related to US development asset in Q1. Production startup which is included in operating expenses totaled $11 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $5 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease is driven by the start of production of our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia in February. We also acknowledged the wide spread use of non-GAAP financial measures across financial markets. We recognize the certainty and comparability that consistently providing historical financial and guidance on a GAAP basis comparing to analyst and investors. However, we also appreciate the need to understand non-cash and certain one-time cost in calculating valuation metrics and will therefore as appropriately continue to highlight many of these items. In this context, Q1 operating income is $252 million which included depreciation and amortization of $63 million, share based compensation is $3 million, ramp underutilization and production startup expense totaling $16 million and a gain on the sales of our US project development and North American O&M businesses were $151 million. In Q1, we realized $12 million gain on the sales of certain marketable securities associated with our end-of-life module collection recycling program within the other income line on the P&L. We recorded tax expense of $46 million in the first quarter compared to a tax benefit of $66 million in the prior quarter and the increase in tax expense in Q1 is attributable to an increase in pre-tax income and a discrete tax benefit in Q4 of 2020, $61 million associated with the closing of the statute of limitations on certain positions. Combination the aforementioned items first quarter earnings per share $1.96 compared to $1.08 in Q4 of 2020. Turn to Slide 8 to discuss balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter $1.8 billion which was largely unchanged compared to the prior quarter. Several factors impacted our quarter end cash balance. Firstly, while we completed the sale of our US project development business and certain equipment on March 31 for an aggregate transaction price of $284 million. The proceeds from the transactions were received in early April. Secondly as previously mentioned, we sold certain restricted marketable securities associated with our end-of-life collection recycling program for total proceeds of $259 million and whilst the intent to subsequently reinvest these proceeds as of quarter end, they were included on the balance sheet as restricted cash. Thirdly, whilst we also completed the sale of our Sun Streams 2, 4 and 5 project during the quarter due to the contemplated payment structure. The closing of these transactions did not have a significant impact on our quarter and cash balance. And finally, the proceeds received from the sale of our North American O&M business were offset by operating expenses and capital expense in Q1. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $257 million, a decrease of $22 million from the end of Q4. This decrease was driven by payment of loan balance matured during Q1 and partially offset by loan drawn down from projects in Japan. And as a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding project is sold. Our net cash position which includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, increased by approximately $25 million to $1.5 billion as a result of aforementioned factors. Net working capital in Q1 which includes non-current project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities increased by $423 million compared to the prior quarter. This increase primarily driven by $472 million increase in accounts receivables related to our US project development business and our Sun Streams 2 sales which is partially offset by decrease in project assets. Net cash used by operating activities was $279 million in the first quarter which includes the aforementioned increase in accounts receivable relates to the payment timing of our US project development business and Sun Streams 2 sales. And finally, capital expenditures were $90 million in the first quarter compared to $89 million in the prior quarter. Continuing on Slide 9, I'll next discuss 2021 guidance. Our Q1 earnings provided positive stock for the year. But we're leaving our EPS guidance unchanged for time being largely due to the following reasons. Firstly, also the time of prior earnings call we anticipated the gain on sale of our US project development in North American O&M businesses of $135 million to $150 million. At closing, we recognized a pretax gain of $151 million. Secondly, the fifth round of our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia. The factory quickly exited its ramp period. For the result, we anticipated reduction in our full year ramp expense which we anticipate will be partially offset by an increase in production start-up expense. Thirdly, we also have strategies in place to mitigate the potential negative effects of higher cost including sales rate and aluminum. The functions about these costs and our mitigating strategies are impacted in our 2021 guidance. Finally, the February earnings call, we anticipated sales trade will reduce our full year 2021 module segment gross margin by 7 to 8 percentage points whilst we continue to mitigate the effect of high shipping through improved efficiency, expansion while distribution network and implement of Series 6 plus. We currently anticipate sales reg will reduce our 2021 module gross margin by 7.5 to 8.5 percentage points, 50 basis points increase from the prior earnings call. Also whilst the hedge we put in place mitigated some of the effect of high commodity price, uncertainty relating to future cost is considered in our low end of our guidance range. Whilst we're facing near term cost challenges predominantly related to sales trade. Our confidence related to our previously disclosed mid-term, cost per watt reduction roadmap remains unchanged. These factors in mind. We're updating our 2021 guidance as follows; our module segment revenue guidance of $2.45 to $2.55 billion is unchanged. Our updated net sales guidance is $2.85 billion to $3.025 billion which reflects $25 million increase to high end of systems revenue guidance. Our module segment gross margin guidance $565 million, $615 million which represents a $15 million and $10 million reduction respectively to the low and high end of our previous guidance range. This revision reflects our current expectations related to commodity and sales rate cost which is partially offset by reduction in ramp related expense. Note, the results of these cost we anticipate our Q4 module segment gross margin with approximately 25%. This anticipate module segment gross margin includes $10 million of underutilization expenses related to factory upgrades which is expected to reduce module segment gross margin by approximately 2%. We also anticipate approximately 60% of our module segment gross revenue for the year will be recognized in the second half of the year. Our updated system segment gross margin guidance with $130 million to $160 million which reflects $10 million increase to the high end of the range due to the potential recovery at system cost. A portion of which we've already received. We anticipate the majority of our remaining full year systems segment revenue and gross margin will be recognized in the second half of the year. Otherwise, total gross margin is $695 million to $757 million which reflects the $15 million decrease to the low end of the range. SG&A and R&D expenses have been lowered by $5 million to wide range to $265 million to $275 million. Production startup expenses increased by $5 million and as a result operating expense guidance range of $285 million to $300 million is unchanged. Operating income guidance $535 million to $640 million in unchanged. It includes anticipated depreciation amortization of $263 million, share based compensation of $21 million, ramp underutilization of production startup expense totaling $61 million to $66 million. And a gain on the sale of our US project development in North American O&M businesses $151 million. Our tax guidance of $100 million to $120 million is unchanged and includes approximately $34 million of expense related to the sale of our US project development and North American O&M businesses. Earnings per share guidance $4.05 to $4.75 remains unchanged and our net cash, capital expenditures and shipments guidance also remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 10, I'll summarize key messages for call today. Financial sectors, with a strong Q1 EPS and $1.96, module segment gross margin in line with our Q1 guidance and reiterated our 2021 EPS guidance range of $4.05 and $4.75 per share. Operating, second Series 6 factory exited its ramp period and our nameplate manufacturing capacity increased to 7.9 gigawatts. Additionally as a result of continued execution we're on track to achieve our target 11% cost per watt produced reduction between the end of fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021. And finally, Series 6 demand has been robust with 4.8 gigawatts year-to-date net bookings which includes 2.9 gigawatts since the previous earnings calls. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your first question is from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital. Philip Shen : The first one is on pricing. I know Mark, you gave some detail on the decrease of 11% year-over-year in 2022 with the bookings you have. But crystalline silicon pricing is up meaningfully, our checks are for pricing at $0.35 to $0.38 level at the spot market and so how is that impacting your discussions, how much of that can you benefit from? And then just my second question here as it relates to capacity. Was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color India was on the roadmap for a bit, with COVID problems there I can imagine, India is off the table. So what variable are you using and thinking about as you consider locking in as expansion in a decision? Do you need more clarity from the Biden Administration and I know it's going to come on in Q2? But some initial color there will be fantastic. Thanks. Mark Widmar : Phil, first on the pricing environment. Clearly, we've seen pricing from up - as we look across horizon whether it's not a lot of volume for occurring. But at the extent we had US available supply and current use. You'll see from our pricing. But your eventual look across the horizon and to 2022, 2023 and 2024. The one limiting factor that you know relative to the number that you referenced is that, there's - in the US in particular the projects that people have bid are under significant pressure really from all dimensions. And ultimately it all come down, an affordability, although there's going to be a number of these project that just not going to happen because when you look at the general cost pressures that they're seeing, just commodity cost pressures, right? When steel going up, aluminum going up, copper going up. You're seeing pretty much the entire balance system labor cost under pressure as well. It's pretty strange in all these projects and one of things we got to be mindful of it. We price across the horizon. It still has to fundamentally work within a customers pro forma, their financials have to work. And so to, to try to go out and capture the highest potential price point. I'm not sure it's going to serve us the best when it comes to ensuring the viability of the project. And so we've been trying to work with very capable well financed counterparties and having high certainty and quality of the execution of the projects which form our views around certainty of execution, we need to make sure that the economics on pricing works. The other thing I would say that falls into the equation is the, our confidence around our cost reduction roadmap. So as to look to our cost reduction roadmap we are very happy with where we are and the opportunities that still in front of us to drive cost down meaningfully lower than where it is right now. The one piece of the cost structure that is not as robust inability to control, they were highlighting right now a sales trade. But as we're looking forward into these new contracts. We're putting variable structures and there around sales trade such that we're not carrying that risk profile. The customer is going to share in that and to the extent the sales trade environment phase similar to where it's right now then there's pass through at that cost with slightly different dynamic than what we had historically. So those variables all factor in how we price it. There's an opportunistic moment right now. We look to ourselves as establishing deep partnership in relationships with our own customers. Customers that we now have capabilities and execute and try to create a solution that works for both parties in that regard. As it relates to the capacity expansion, look India is going through horrible time right now. I mean you see cases there closes 400,000 a day I mean which is horrific but I don't want you to think that because of that, we're confident that with the help India will continue to receive from international partners and allies like United States and others. This will be a difficult challenge. We'll have to get through but they'll get through it. And we're still evaluating India very significantly as a growth market for us. We look at the technology and competitiveness of the technology in India, it's ideally suited. When you have CdTe cell technology especially with CuRe and improved long-term degradation rate, hot, humid climate. Mainly fixed tilt structures, mainly model facial therefore for the true value uplift we get from the CuRe against monofacial realizes itself and then higher ASPs. The fact that the duties that have been imposed right now for imports, makes even more critical for us and say how we address that market, even the events are the approved list of module manufacturers is another constraints to access in either markets. India is a very important market for us. US we're very well positioned to - we've got - already when we stayed in Ohio, we had an option on, actually purchased additional land that would accommodate a large facility. The current savings and commitments that we're seeing from the administration positive. But unfortunately slow back in some regards so that is little frustrating. But generally think pretty good undertones for enabling our work past of the year, our most important market in. As we highlighted in the call sale trade being closed to market. You can take a penny or so, a cost up from sales trade, right to drive across down even more competitive. So that's how important. The only thing I would say to make sure it's clear so is that, the other thing they were doing is that, the next factory or factories. Will be larger than anything we have today and they will be our most advanced and competitively positioned product and, in some case, we're also going to further enhance automation and through the factory process. So it's going to be best product, highest performing, lowest cost that will be said function and proven from where we're right and so that's taking a little bit more time to validating, solidifying all that, that worked to get comfortable with that. We've been spending a lot of time. I wanted to make it clear in the call that we will be making a final decision by the July earnings because I know it's something we continue get asked questions around. We're pretty advanced in our evaluation. To extent we make the decision to move forward and if you hit all the criteria's that we highlighted, then we'll make sure we make that announcement in July if we chose not to do it. Then we'll provide the direction that we're going to move forward in lieu of that. So yes, lot of good work being done right now. But we want to make sure whatever we do, is that we really create again competitively, its damage, disruptive product from where we're right now. Alex Bradley : So just one thing I'll add on the ASPs, is that for the deals we're booking right now these are deals that we've likely been in discussion with customers on calls, many months and I think the phenomenon you're seeing around crystalline silicon is pricing come relatively recently, whilst I'm sure many of our competitors will have taken the opportunity to reneged on pricing that was perhaps put out as [indiscernible] as Mark said, we look for long-term relationships - customers we chose not to do that. So we've held pricing despite what we're seeing in the market. I just wanted to make that point also. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse Securities. Michael Weinstein : Do you have any potential plans to produce a residential product getting continuous efficiency improvements? I was thinking perhaps the tandem junction product you mentioned. Mark Widmar : Yes, that product will be ideally suited for that type of application. So it's going to be highest efficiency, best energy profile and that would be - we would target segments as a market that will pay a premium for the efficiency and residential would be primary market for that. And so as further along and commercializing that and scaling up that technology. Yes, I think it expands in a market segment that today we historically not sold into. But there'll be other high efficiency markets that will love to in terms of land constraint and other challenges that you have to deal with where our efficiency product would be advantageous. But yes, residential would be one. Michael Weinstein : That's great. Just a follow-up on the call couple questions you were asked. You answered about optionality and pricing. How about tariffs? How do you deal with the possibility there might be additional tariffs? Or tariffs might be going away in your pricing going forward like out for 2022, 2023, 2024? Mark Widmar : I've kind of alluded to this for a while. I mean we haven't really been - if the issue is tariffs on competition or tariffs on owned product. I mean assume, tariffs that were imposed on crystalline silicon, [indiscernible]. Unfortunately after the first 16 months [indiscernible] being implemented the tariff went away because the bifacial exemption and yes and that's been reinstated, I guess late last year. But most of what we had already sold really through from whenever it was June 2019 until now. It hasn't really been influenced by tariff, the 201 tariffs because of the bifacial exemption and product coming in from Southeast Asia into the US market without having to pay tariffs. The fact that it was then re-imposed late last year really didn't change much for us either because most of our 21 [ph] filing was already sold through at that point. We try to continue to manage and develop relationships and partnerships and even with the 201 were first imposed. It wasn't like we took that as an opportunity to gouge our customers. It doesn't service any good. We're still in the early innings of this industry and the relationships that we establish and the trust that we create with our partners will determine each of our success in over the next decades to come. So yes, they can influential. We do believe that they're important. But we also do believe that there's a need to have additional US manufacturing capabilities and tariffs can help enable that. But it's not something we feel that we would try to take advantage of. As it relates to, if our product were to be - a product that we import from Southeast Asia manufacture somehow would be subject to tariffs and we have provisions within our contracts to try to address those types of events and circumstances if they were to occur. My assumption from your question was just really more related to tariffs relative to our crystalline silicon competitors. It informs the thought around pricing. But we would never want to take it as an opportunity to gouge our customers. Operator : Your next question is from J.B. Lowe with Citi. J.B. Lowe: I just wanted to circle back on the project economics comment that you made, Mark. Because we're seeing kind of the same commentary from the crystalline silicon guys that. They would like to push pricing higher given all their cost issues on the polysilicon side. But they're getting push back from customers who - the economics are pretty thin on their front. So they're not having success pushing through prices increases. So there's that. but I'm also wondering, is there anything in your backlog that you think is more at risk than anything else just given that maybe some of the products in your backlog have some of those thin margins? Just wondering what you're thinking about that. Mark Widmar : Look again when we price those modules, they all aligned up to pro forma financials that would work for the end customers. Now to the extent that they have a price pressures that they're going to be seeing across their supply chain, not a cost increases and things like that yet. It potentially is that drive, thinner margins on their part. It could happen. But as we said before our pricing for our contracts our firm obligations would security behind them. We have not seen that event happening relative to issue our customers are incurring or there's any discussion in that regard. What we try to do, we try to find customers that they value the certainty of working with First Solar and also working with counterparties that we can trust as well and honoring against their commitment and we've been pretty successful in doing that. When things get evolved differently. But what I will say right now is, when you try to think through a balanced relationship and trying to ensure certainty that certainty has to go both ways, [indiscernible] gets our commitments and our customers to accept their commitment they made as well when they contract you for the modules. Operator : Your next question is from Moses Sutton of Barclays. Moses Sutton : Of the 2.9 booked, 2.9 gigawatts since last call. Would you include the recently signed Sun Streams projects? How much of that 2.9 originated from pure third-party module pipeline versus something that was originally in systems? Mark Widmar : So with the Sun Streams, the Sun Streams module volume when you say systems, was not part of the systems sales. I want to make sure that clear, right. So that was a module. Moses Sutton : I mean part of the systems pipeline originally. Mark Widmar : Were really Sun Streams 3, 4 and 5 was never part of the systems pipeline. 3 got terminated, right? But most of that volume was not part of the systems pipeline. But in terms of and Alex you may know this one, in terms of the module volume that when we sold [indiscernible] how much of that was included in the 2.9? Alex Bradley : About three quarters of gig. Mitch Ennis : 744. Alex Bradley : About three quarters of a gigawatt. Mark Widmar : So the 29744 and Moses, I know it's not part of the actual number. But I also want to make sure, since you asked the question. The other gigawatt that we just booked today 3.9 was not at all tied to the systems business. So if you look at it, we've got 3.9 gigawatts that were booked since the last earnings call and about 707 megawatts would have been tied into business [ph]. Moses Sutton : Got it. And then do you think your panel weight against the freight cost per watt are the same first currency refix before the new initiatives then for an average or common mono-PERC, probably competitor. We noticed the virgin claims made by some buyers. Mark Widmar : Moses, can you repeat the question one more time? The weight I got that, make sure I understand your question. Moses Sutton : So really freight cost per watt, your panel versus an average mono-PERC. I know they're all different. Would you say they compare or higher freight cost typically? Mark Widmar : What we're seeing right now because of large form factors, how we're seeing modules now that are like three square meters and alike, they're even shipping them vertically. Those cost of sales freight for those products are going to be much higher than where we're right now. So if you looked at where we would have been again for the - let's say the two-meter square form factor which was the standard before now there's variance all over the place. We would have been slightly higher and mainly because of we wait out on a container. So they would actually be able to get more modules onto a container than we would and they had a slightly higher efficiency. But now if you go to bifacial glass, larger form factor. What's actually happening is they're creating a disadvantage on a freight cost for themselves. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : I had two, one on systems and just one on kind of the cost reduction path. First on the systems, Mark you said there is - there's $130, $160 million in gross profit this year in the guide. Just wondering after all the divestiture here recently how much of any there's left pretty monetized in 2022 and then if there's any Japan in the near to medium term, you're kind of you phrased it as like three to five-year opportunity. Just wondering if there's anything in the next one to two years there. And then on the cost reduction side, you mentioned 11% reduction in ASPs for 2022 bookings at the moment. Cost reductions have been at that level or below it seems like so just wondering, is there a scenario in which you kind of start to accelerate that and maintain a stable gross margin on modules given, you're starting already 11% in the whole if you will on the pricing side adding into next year. Thanks guys. Alex Bradley : On the systems side, how we guided to the 132, 160 num [ph] fee. There's a valid $80 million recognized in Q1, $60 million to the midpoint from rest of the year. Most of that comes from Japan. You're going to see that happen in the second half of the year. And then if you look through the on lag, you can think about there being a little bit of Japan, here it's potentially more sort of out. But you're going to see Japan coming over the next three to five years. So you'll see an impact every year out of there. On the cost side, on cost per watt. I think we talked about 11% cost per watt reduction on produced basis for the year. So we see a production number that's matching. But we see in terms of decline on ASP and obviously that's on a percentage basis on lower number. You're going to have a little bit gross margin squeeze if you have the same reduction from an ASP in a cost per watt size. The other thing to bear in mind and mark my words, totaling more in the cost, rather stay on the OpEx side. We talk a lot about gross margin. I think it's important that we match that gross margin or continue to beat it. But one of the benefits of scale and one of the things we're talking about in terms of expansion and looking at manufacturing capacity is the ability to leverage fixed cost base as well. So we can even if we just maintain a matching number in terms of cost reduction relative to where the revenue decreases are. We can actually see a benefit coming through on the operating cost side. We've done a pretty good job there. I think if you look back over the last decade or so bringing that sell for number down from 20 or so 10 years ago, maybe $0.10 a watt and five years ago. This year if you look at, it will be somewhere around three and half cents a watt and as we go forward given that operating cost structure is largely fixed. It's managed and fixed. You can see as go over past year, it's going to come down and so you can get either maintaining operating margins or poor expansion, the operating margin levels. There's lot of work still to do it at the gross margin level. But just want to make sure that comment is not missed. We look it at also further down to operating margin level. Mark Widmar : The other thing I would say Brian is that, there are lot of things that are in the mix now that will help continue to drive down the cost per watt. I mean part of this year is you got to remember we're taking a little bit of headwind around the impact of planned downtime as we made a number of upgrades before CuRe in particular. So that's costing us about half penny of watt or so that for the year. Now for into next year, we don't have as significant upgrades as we currently envision relative to the technology roadmap that we need to rollout that would have as significant of a headwind given the downtime we had to take for this year. So that has normalized itself. We also have the efficiency continues to improve from this point through the end and we have an exit from 465 watt and then we'll exit 2022. I think its 480 watt or something like that as well. What we previously indicated. So that helps drive. But then we've got a number of other billing material initiatives that will drive improvement and one of them just even on our last cost because there's different tiered pricing as we drive more volume across our contracts for glass. We hit different tiers would actually drive down pricing. So there's number, we used that bridge before. When you look at the throughput lever, where there's more throughput to go. There's more efficiency benefit and then we have the watt, the improvement that we'll make and we don't have as much planned downtime at least as we currently envision it. So those who all will help us manage and cross that horizon for 2022. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitchell Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announced its second quarter 2021 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com.  With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter, provide updated guidance for 2021. Following remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations, including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description.  It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, I would like to start by thanking the First Solar team passion, continuing excellence and there are many achievements in the second quarter. Operationally, we have started site preparation with the recently announced 3.3 gigawatt factory in Ohio, which will further cement our position as the largest PV module manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere.  Additionally, I'm pleased to announce that contingent upon permitting and approval of government incentives that are satisfactory to First Solar, we are intending to invest approximately $680 million to add 3.3 gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in India. These next-generation factories represent a significant leap forward in our technology road map and will produce our most competitively advantaged modules with an expected lower cost per watt and environmental footprint compared to our existing fleet.  Commercially, market demand for our CdTe technology is at a record level. Seven months into the year, we have already booked 9 gigawatts, exceeding our prior annual record of 7.7 gigawatts in 2017. From a technology standpoint, our production lines are manufacturing record modules. To illustrate this point, samples produced during our regular production process were submitted for external verification and confirmed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory at a world record 19.2% glass area efficiency for a CdTe module. For reference and in comparison to our previous aperture area record of 19% efficiency, our new record equates to a 19.7% aperture area efficiency.  Additionally, our advanced research team has been creating new optionality in our R&D road map. For example, we recently deployed prototypes of early-stage bifacial modules at a test facility and are pleased with the initial results.  In summary, the momentum we have cultivated, paired with an increased favorable policy environment, represents a compelling growth opportunity in the near to midterm. However, before discussing these opportunities, I will first provide near-term COVID-19 supply chain cost and market updates.  Please turn to Slide 4. As a global company with the manufacturing operations in the United States, Malaysia and Vietnam, the health and safety of our associates our top priority, with a steadfast commitment to adhering to applicable COVID-19 protocols. As part of this effort, we are working with local governments to facilitate on-site testing and vaccination for our associates.  I would also like to express immense gratitude to our Vietnam manufacturing associates who have to date elected to remain on site in order to maintain manufacturing continuity. While this clearly is a challenging time, we acknowledge your incredible resiliency, ingenuity and leadership to deliver your operational plan commitments.  While we have been permitted and able to maintain manufacturing operations in Malaysia and Vietnam to date, the rise of COVID-19 cases and potential government and other restrictions present risks to our production, supply chain and technology implementation plans. As it relates to our CuRe program, the factory updates and tool implementations at our Vietnam site requires international travel from both third-party equipment installers as well as our U.S.-based associates. But we continue to work with relevant agencies in Vietnam who support this essential travel in a safe manner. Delays resulting from government and other COVID-related restrictions, or an increase in case rates may impact the timing of our cure transition in Vietnam.  Despite this uncertainty, we continue to execute and navigate the current environment as reflected by the manufacturing performance metrics on Slide 4. As highlighted previously, the global shipping environment remains challenging due to port congestion, limited container availability, an increase in cancellation of shipments by logistic providers, scheduled reliability issues and other events. Since the April earnings call, shipping rates have continued to rise. And additionally, COVID-19 outbreaks and restrictions have caused disruptions in China and Southeast Asia, the impacts which have reverberated across the global logistics market. These challenges, coupled with strong global demand have led to a significant increase in the cost of transoceanic freight.  We have partially mitigated the effects of higher shipping cost per watt through improvements in our module efficiency, implementation of Series 6 Plus, expansion of our distribution network strategy in the United States and forward contracts. However, we have seen and expect to continue to see for the remainder of 2021 adverse impacts on our financial results. For context, spot rates for routes between Asia and the United States have increased 200% to 300% from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021. Over this period, sales rate reduced our module segment gross margin by 9 percentage points in Q2 of 2021 or 3 percentage points higher year-on-year.  We continue to facilitate -- anticipate near-term challenges, including elevated fuel cost, average vessel delays of 2 weeks and constrained container availability, impacting our ability to use space secured on vessels. Although these factors contribute to lower-than-anticipated shipments in Q2 and higher freight costs, we have a number of near-term and long-term strategies intended to improve our competitive position with regards to sales.  Near term, we are working closely with our customers to limit our exposure to inflated sales freight costs. In certain situations, we have accommodated requests for delayed module shipments, which provide opportunities to mitigate higher freight costs. Given current vessel schedule reliability, we are adding scheduled buffers to better meet our customers' commitments and provide greater resiliency in our shipment plan.  Average sales freight from Malaysia and Vietnam to our U.S. customers increased $0.05 per watt quarter-on-quarter, ending Q2 was approximately triple that of shipments from Ohio. Long term, this reinforces the strategic thesis for located in additional manufacturing capacity near to demand. Contractually, for certain new bookings, we have employed structures that mitigate sales freight costs in excess of prenegotiated levels. As we continue to secure bookings for deliveries 2 to 3 years in the future, this type of contractual arrangement will help derisk the expected value of our contracted backlog.  I would next like to discuss the key components of our bill and material spend, approximately 2/3 of which is made up of glass and frame costs. From a glass perspective, we have largely hedged the cost through long-term fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have volumetric pricing benefits as we achieve higher levels of production.  With regards to aluminum, in August of 2020, we entered into a commodity swap contract to hedge a portion of our U.S. cash flows for purchases of aluminum frames, which ends in Q4. While we anticipate some impacts of the hedge roll -- as the hedge rolls off, we intend to partially mitigate the cost per watt impact through reduced aluminum for module uses, firstly, by differentiating between interior and exterior modules; and secondly, by redesigning the frame.  Finally, the cost of lumber, which is used for our shipping and packing process, was approximately 70% higher on an index basis in Q2 compared to the start of the year. This impacted our Q2 results by approximately $2 million. Since then, lumber costs have significantly declined. And as a result, we are currently not expected to impact our 2021 exit rate cost per watt target. In summary, while cost and uncertainties remain uncertain bill of material items, we are tracking to achieve a 9% cost per watt produced reduction between where we ended 2020 and expect to end 2021. Note while core production costs are largely on track, the 2 percentage point decrease in our year-over-year cost per watt reduction relative to the previous expectation is largely due to the effects of higher inbound freight costs for raw materials. On a cost per watt sold basis, due to the challenging near-term sales rate environment, our revised year-over-year reduction target is 3%.  Note, as a reminder, sales rate is included in our cost of sales, whereas many of our module peers report sales rate as a separate operating expense. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider this fact with benchmarking our module gross margin percentages relative to our peers. Turning to Slide 5, I would like to provide some context on the ASP trajectory for the year. As a reminder, 2 years ago on the Q2 2019 earnings call, we indicated approximately 4 gigawatts of our 2021 module supply was booked or contracted subject to conditions precedent. In other words, a significant portion of the volumes sold this year had an ASP agreed to 2 years prior to model delivery. Heading into 2020 and into 2021, we were largely sold out of our available supply for the forward year. As a result, we've had limited exposure to the spot market. We believe there is a strong strategic rationale for forward contracting deliveries in this manner, which provides value for both First Solar and our customers. From our perspective, contracting for future deliveries provides us confidence in our ability to sell through our expected supply and visibility into an expected profit per watt in a TV market that is typically highly price competitive.  From our customers' perspective, these arrangements provide value to clarity and certainty of pricing, product availability and delivery timing, enabling them to underwrite PPAs from a position of strength, with a lower risk to their expected project returns. Being able to provide the certainty to both buyer and seller is a strategic differentiator for First Solar.  From a U.S. policy perspective, both near and long-term pricing for all solar modules, is also impacted by uncertainty over legislation related to force labor in China, tariffs, manufacturing tax credits, investment tax credits and other restrictions and incentives. Given the current lack of clarity over the form, structure and duration of potential policy changes, the near-term and long-term impacts of these on both demand and pricing also remain uncertain. Moreover, this lack of clarity needs to be balanced with the significant capacity expansions announced by our competitors.  From First Solar's perspective, we aim to continue to work with capable, well-financed counterparties that have high certainty in the quality and execution of the projects. We also look to establish and maintain deep relationships and partnerships with our customers, delivering solutions at a fair pricing level that meets their needs and also enables attractive returns for First Solar relative to our expected future cost per watt. At the time of the previous earnings call, we indicated that the ASP across the volume of potential deliveries in 2022 was 11% lower than the volume to be shipped in 2021. Including our incremental bookings since the previous earnings call, the year-on-year decline is largely unchanged.  Looking into 2023, we are very pleased with the demand and pricing we are seeing for our cad tel modules as we continue to drive to higher wattage and efficiency levels. Although there remains significant uncontracted volume to be booked, the ASP across the contracted volume for planned deliveries in 2023 is only 1% lower than that volume planned for 2022.  Note, while we have yet to commence the sales process for our next-generation PV modules to be produced by our recently announced factories, they are expected to be ASP advantages to their anticipated higher efficiency and superior balance of system cost per watt profile. In summary, as we have seen a significant increase in desire to work with First Solar due to our demonstrated value proposition. While pricing negotiations in the market remain competitive, we continue to secure volume with customers that value our points of, with the potential for ASP catalysts in the future. Relative to this objective, we are very pleased with our record year-to-date net bookings of 9 gigawatts, which includes 4.1 gigawatts since the April's earnings call. After accounting for shipments of approximately 1.8 gigawatts during the second quarter, our future expected shipments would extend into 2024 or 17.2 gigawatts.  Including our year-to-date bookings, we are largely sold out for 2021 and 2022, have 3.4 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2023 and 4 and 5 gigawatts in 2024. This long-term demand further supports the investment thesis behind our third Ohio factory and our first factory in India.  Additionally, and as reflected on Slide 6, from an opportunities perspective, our pipeline of future opportunities also remains robust. Note, our capacity expansion in India, and the related increase in available supply to meet projected domestic demand, expands our booking opportunities in the country. And accordingly, our potential bookings in India exceeds 7 gigawatts.  We'd also like to take the opportunity to address the reported use of force labor in the crystalline silicon PV manufacturing industry, which has been highlighted by the recent withhold and release order issued by the U.S. Custom and Border Protection; the Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory from the U.S. government and the Weaver forced Labor Perfection Act which passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous consent; an investigation by the United Kingdom and other countries in the EU.  Climate change is among the most pressing issues facing society today. And fortunately, the challenges of decarbonization of the global electric mix can largely be addressed with commercially available technologies, including solar, wind, energy storage and green hydrogen. Unfortunately, the crystalline silicon supply chain is tainted by the purported use of forced labor and human rights abuses in China, which necessitates urgent action. However, it must be understood that our global collective response to forced labor does not need conflict with a long-term global climate objectives.  While there are commercial solutions to ensure supply chain continuity, we've acknowledged the near-term supply challenges presented by the withholding release issue by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These challenges are exacerbated by the overly complex and opaque nature of the crystalline silicon manufacturing process. While the issue of force labor represents an urgent ethical imperative that must be addressed, it also presents a strategic opportunity to drive change and an opportunity for the United States and like-minded nations to achieve energy security and technological independence through the promotion of a PV domestic manufacturing industry. Relative to this, we strongly support the proposed Solar Energy Manufacturing in America Act, which was introduced by Georgia Senator, Jon Ossoff, and co-sponsored by Senators, Warnock, Bennett and Stabenow.  We believe that is inactive, it will help accelerate the transition to clean energy using domestically produced technology, support American energy independence and create high-quality manufacturing jobs. By creating tax incentives for vertically integrated manufacturers and for each step of the crystalline supply chain, we can establish a level playing field where all PV technologies compete on their own merits and establish a domestic capacity to support America's climate objective.  We believe the Biden-Harris administration has a unique opportunity to adopt a long-term industry policy for solar, which could include a mix of manufacturing tax credits and extension of the investment tax credit with a domestic content requirement among other strategies. Through a long-term strategic approach to policy, the administration has an opportunity to create an environment that fosters innovation for next generation of PV. While legislative outcome for the U.S. infrastructure in solar remains uncertain, we are broadly encouraged by the legislative sentiment and the willingness to support U.S. PV manufacturing to enable energy independence, security and climate global imperatives.  Turning to Slide 7. Looking forward, we believe strong demand for Series 6, a compelling technology road map, a strong balance sheet and largely fixed operating expense cost structure and an increasingly favorable policy environment for domestic PV manufacturing in the United States and India are catalysts as we evaluate capacity expansion.  With respect to the United States, as announced in June, we are more than doubling our manufacturing capacity in the United States, adding 3.3 gigawatts at an implied CapEx per watt of approximately $0.20. This greenfield expansion financed by cash on hand represents an opportunity, unbound by the legacy Series 4 constraints to optimize each parameter of the factory and product design. Accordingly, this enables us to develop a new product at the intersection of efficiency, energy yield, optimized form factor, cost competitiveness and advantaged environmental attributes.  Starting in 2023, this factory of the future is expected to commence production of our next-generation module, which is expected to lead the fleet in terms of efficiency, module wattage, cost per watt and environmental footprint. Our next-generation module building upon our CuRe program is expected to push boundaries of our cad tel platform in several ways. Firstly, in midterm, we anticipate this module can achieve efficiency in excess of 20% and with an optimized form factor enable module wattage in excess of our current midterm target. Secondly, we optimized the form factor anticipation to benefit balance of system cost per watt and consequently, module ASP. Thirdly, through an optimization of the module's mounting interface and an increase in automation, this factory is expected to achieve a lower cost per watt produced than our existing fleet, despite being located in a higher cost labor market. Finally, by locating this factory domestically, we reduced our reliance on transoceanic freight costs and anticipated reducing sales freight per watt in the -- for U.S. deliveries.  Our third factory in Ohio is expected to commence commercial production in the first half of 2023, scale to over 3 gigawatts of nameplate capacity by the end of the year and 3.3 gigawatts in 2025. Internationally, we have been evaluating the expansion of our manufacturing presence in India. Our technology is uniquely advantaged in the market due to our temperature coefficient and spectral response advantages, which can result in higher energy per watt installed as compared to crystalline silicon due to the effects of heat and humidity.  As we stated previously, we believe CuRe significantly increases our competitiveness against bifacial modules. The India PV market is predominantly monofacial due to generally low and additionally, the cost of bifacial systems exceeding the benefits of backside energy due to high capital costs, and the additional real estate needed for bifacial plants. However, given the expected lifetime energy benefit of our cure modules, we can achieve with no increase in balance of system costs or other project costs, we are well positioned to capture the value of CuRe in the India market.  We also thought the steps India has taken to foster a healthy domestic PV manufacturing industry which includes a combination of federal and state incentives and national barriers. This includes, among others, a $600 million production-linked incentive scheme with preference given for vertically integrated PV manufacturers who produce modules with an advantaged temperature coefficient. In addition to domestic incentives, India announced a solar tariff policy starting in April 2022, which includes 25% and 40% duties on imported and modules, respectively. Through its strategic approach, India has combined its clean energy targets with effective trade and industrial policy designed to enable self-sufficient domestic manufacturing and true energy security.  As previously indicated, the factors in evaluating the future capacity expansion include geographic proximity to solar demand where First Solar has an energy or competitive advantage and which could mitigate freight-related costs. Secondly, the ability to export cost competitively into other markets. Thirdly, cost-competitive labor, low energy costs and low real estate cost. Fourthly, a competitive supply changes for source of raw materials and components. And finally, domestic and international policies to ensure such expansion is well positioned. In summary, we believe India meets these criteria.  With the strong demand for our cad tel technology, we are eager to grow our manufacturing capacity to meet this market demand. With our expansion in the United States and India and optimization of our existing fleet, we anticipate our nameplate manufacturing capacity will double to 16 gigawatts in 2024, with the new factories combining 2 to 3 gigawatts of production in 2023.  Moving on to technology. There were several noteworthy accomplishments since the previous earnings call. Firstly, following the implementation of Series 6 Plus in our 2 factories in Ohio, we are now consistently producing 450-watt modules in Ohio and Malaysia, increasing our fleet-wide average watt per module to 4.49 for July month-to-date. Secondly, our commercial production lines are manufacturing record modules, as previously discussed. Finally, our CuRe product has been certified as meeting UL and IEC standards, representing an achievement of the robust quality, reliability and safety requirements.  As we look to extend our advantages in the utility scale market, we recently deployed prototypes of early-stage bifacial cad tel modules at a test facility and are pleased with the initial results, demonstrating real-world bifaciality. While this is only early stage research, we believe there is a path to increase bifacial performance, which has the potential to improve upon our existing temperature coefficient, spectral response, partial shaving and long-term degradation energy advantages. As we've previously stated, we believe CuRe significantly increases our competitiveness against bifacial modules.  By potentially unlocking cad tel bifacial capabilities, we have the opportunity to further improve our existing energy advantage and ground mountain applications. In the residential and C&I markets, we recognize the value of high efficiency aesthetically pleasing and domestically manufactured product. As stated previously, we continue to evaluate the prospects of leveraging the high band gap advantages of cad tel and a disruptive high-efficiency, low-cost tandem or multi-junction device. We strongly believe that a thin film semiconductor is essential to achieving the highest-performing tandem PV modules and that cad tel, which benefits from the many innovations of our technology road map and has a proven commercially scaled track record is ideally placed to enable this leap forward in high-performance modules.  In the midterm, we believe there is a path to achieve a 25% efficient multi-junction PV module. As we seek to grow our presence and competitive position in the residential and C&I markets, we believe this type of module has the potential to be disruptive and provide us with a competitive edge.  I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our second quarter financial results and 2021 guidance. Alexander Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before discussing our Q2 results and 2021 financial guidance, I'd like to reiterate our core operating principle of endeavoring to create shareholder value through a disciplined decision-making framework, balancing growth, liquidity and profitability.  As it relates to growth, we anticipate doubling our nameplate manufacturing capacity from approximately 8 gigawatts today to 16 gigawatts in 2024 through adding additional factories in Ohio and India as well as optimizing our existing fleet. Beyond that, we continue to evaluate the potential for further expansion in the United States as the policy environment develops.  While liquidity position has been a strategic differentiator in an industry that has historically prioritized growth without regard to long-term capital structure. Importantly, we anticipate we'll be able to continue to self-fund the capacity expansion and strategic investments in our technology, whilst maintaining a strong differentiated balance sheet, which we believe is a meaningful competitive differentiator. While the strength of our balance sheet provides this flexibility, as we expand internationally, we may elect to utilize debt to mitigate currency risk and optimize return on our international expansion. As it relates to profitability, our technology and capacity road map are expected to enhance our long-term earnings potential. Despite a long-term PV industry trend of declining ASPs, we anticipate revenue growth through capacity expansion.  From a pricing perspective, although there remains significant uncontracted volume yet to book, we're pleased with the pricing levels we've secured to date for 2023 deliveries, which in aggregate are only 1% lower than that of volume planned delivery in 2022.  From a margin perspective, continued progress towards our midterm cost toward objective is expected to enhance our profit for potential. And furthermore, we've yet to book 2023 volumes for our next-generation PV modules which are expected to be produced by our recently announced factories. These modules are expected to be both ASP advantage due to their higher efficiency and optimized form factor, which creates value for customers as well as cost per watt advantages.  Combined with the benefits of locating supply near to demand and reducing the cost of sales rate, these factories are expected to increase gross margin per watt by approximately $0.01 to $0.03 relative to our existing fleet. Overall, we leave a combination of capacity growth, technology enhancements and reducing our cost per watt, coupled with an operating cost structure that is 80% to 90% fixed, will drive meaningful contribution margin as we scale.  Before reviewing our overall financial results for the quarter, I'll first discuss the legacy system license that benefited revenue and margin during the period. 2014, we sold a project that was eligible for a 30% cash grant payment under Section 1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The indemnification arrangement in September of 2017, we indemnified the project poster following the underpayment of anticipated cash flow and proceeds by the U.S. government.  In 2018, the project entity commenced legal action seeking full payment of the previously expected cash grants. In Q2 of this year, a settlement was reached pursuant to which the U.S. government made a payment in Q3 to the project entity, a portion of which we're entitled to. Accordingly, we recognized systems segment revenue of approximately $65 million during the quarter, which directly benefited gross margin.  Starting on Slide 8, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the second quarter. Net sales in Q2 were $629 million, a decrease of $174 million compared to the prior quarter. Decrease in net sales was primarily due to the sale of the Sun Streams 2, 4 and 5 projects in the prior quarter, partially offset by the aforementioned settlement agreement. On a segment basis, our module segment revenue in Q2 was $543 million compared to $535 million in the prior quarter. Total gross margin was 28% in Q2 compared to 23% in Q1. Systems segment gross margin of $65 million was largely driven by the previously mentioned settlement agreement.  Despite the aforementioned delays in certain module deliveries as well as higher-than-expected logistics costs, our Q2 module segment gross margin increased to 20% from 19% in the prior quarter. Whilst we continue to navigate and partially mitigate the effects of the dislocated shipping market, higher freight cost impacted our financial results for the quarter. In Q2, sales rate totaled approximately $50 million or 9 percentage points of module gross margin. Along with module warranty expense of approximately $2 million, sales freight and warranty reduced our module saving gross margin by approximately 10 percentage points. And as mentioned, we're in the process of implementing Series 6 Plus and CuRe in 2021, which requires downtime resulting in lower production and underutilization.  In Q2, our module segment gross margin was impacted by $7 million of underutilization. In total, sales rate, module warranty and underutilization impacted our Q2 module gross margin by approximately 11 percentage points. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $60 million in the second quarter, a decrease of approximately $12 million compared to the prior quarter. In Q2, we had a $3 million reduction in expected credit losses benefited SG&A expense. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses, totaled $2 million in Q2, a decrease of $10 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was driven by the start of commercial production at our second Series 6 factory in Malaysia in Q1.  Q2 operating income was $110 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $66 million, $65 million related to the aforementioned settlement agreement, $9 million related to unutilization and production start-up expense and share-based compensation of $5 million. We recorded tax expense of $20 million in the second quarter compared to $46 million in Q1. The decrease in tax expense for Q2 is largely attributable to lower pretax income. The combination of the aforementioned items led to second quarter earnings per share of $0.77 and $2.73 for the first 2 quarters of 2021 on a diluted basis.  Next turning to Slide 9, I'll discuss fixed balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, an increase of $255 million compared to the prior quarter with several factors impacting our quarter end cash balance. Firstly, in Q1, we sold certain restricted marketable securities associated with our module collection and recycling program for total proceeds of $259 million. We intend to reinvest these proceeds, at which point they will be considered restricted marketable securities, which are not included in our measure of total cash.  Secondly, in early April, we received proceeds from the sale of our U.S. project development business. And finally, our operating cash flows during the quarter were partially offset by capital expenditures. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $279 million, an increase of $22 million from the end of Q1. This increase is due to a loan drawdown on the credit facility for a Japanese systems project. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off the balance sheet when the corresponding project is sold.  Our net cash position, which includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, increased by $233 million to $1.8 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Net working capital in Q2, which includes noncurrent project assets and excludes cash and marketable securities, decreased by $176 million compared to the prior quarter. And this decrease was primarily driven by the collection of proceeds from the sale of our U.S. project development business and an increase in current liabilities due to an increase in down payments from module customers.  Net cash generated by operating activities was $177 million in the second quarter. Finally, capital expenditures were $91 million in the second quarter compared to $90 million in the prior quarter.  Continuing on Slide 10, I'll next discuss 2021 guidance. Firstly, starting with our systems business. We recognized a $65 million benefit in Q2 related to the previously mentioned settlement agreement and have incorporated this in our systems revenue and gross margin guidance. Secondly, we're evaluating whether to continue holding our lose our Norte asset in Chile or pursue a sale of this project. The fee such a sale will require coordination of the project lenders and could result in an impairment charge in the future if we are unable to recover our net carrying value in the project. No impact from any possible sale of this project is included in our guidance for the year. As it relates to our module business, there are several key updates. As highlighted on the previous 2 earnings calls, we continue to anticipate elevated shipping costs of 2021. Despite near and long-term strategies to mitigate the impact, the cost of shipping has continued to rise since the April earnings call. As a result of elevated rates, port congestion, limited container availability and schedule reliability issues, sales rate is expected to adversely impact our 2021 results by an incremental $60 million relative to our previous expectations.  For the full year 2021, we anticipate sales rate and warranty will reduce our module segment gross margin by 10 to 11 percentage points, 250 basis point increase from the previous earnings call. Whilst we continue to manage our core manufacturing costs, we also anticipate a shipping-related variable cost headwind of approximately $20 million, primarily due to elevated inbound freight costs for raw materials. Additionally, Q2 shipments were lower than expected use of vessel delays, constrained customer container availability and accommodating certain customer requests. We're currently tracking to achieve full year 2021 shipments of 7.6 to 8 gigawatts which represents a 0.2 gigawatt decrease to the low end of the guidance range. We also acknowledge that the current logistics environment presents risk to our 2021 shipment plan.  As it relates to capacity expansion, our recently announced factories in Ohio and India are anticipated to commence production in 2023 and increased 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $400 million. Related to this expansion, we anticipate incurring an additional $700 million of capital expenditures in 2022 with the remainder in 2023. With these factors in mind, we're updating our 2021 guidance as follows : our module segment revenue guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion represents a $50 million decrease to the low end of guidance range to account for our current expectations on shipment timing. Our updated net sales guidance of $2.875 billion to $3.1 billion, which reflects an increase in systems revenue on both the high and low end of the guidance range due to the aforementioned settlement agreement.  Additionally, we've increased the low end of our guidance -- systems guidance range to account for clarity on project sale accountants. Our module segment gross margin guidance is $485 million to $535 million. Whilst our previous guidance, this represents an $80 million reduction to the high end of the guidance range due to a $60 million increase in expected sales rate and $20 million increase in expected inbound rate. Revised low end also represents an $80 million decrease relative to our previous guidance due to a 0.2 gigawatt reduction in the low end of our shipments guidance and an increase in expected sales and inbound freight costs which are partially offset by risk accounted for in our previous guidance range.  As a result of these factors, we anticipate our module 7 gross margin will be approximately 20% to 21% for the full year. For the full year 2021, we anticipate sales rate and warranty will reduce our module segment gross margin by 10 to 11 percentage points. And in addition, we expect the impact of ramp underutilization and reduced throughput to total $41 million. Our data systems segment gross margin guidance is $210 million to $225 million, which reflects a $65 million increase due to the aforementioned settlement agreement and a $15 million increase to the low end of the guidance range due to the clarity on project sale economics. We anticipate that the majority of our remaining year -- remaining full year systems segment revenue and gross margin, we recognized in the fourth quarter of the year.  Our revised total gross margin guidance of $695 million to $760 million, which reflects a $15 million decrease in the high end of the range. SG&A and R&D expenses of $265 million to $275 million, production start-up expense of $20 million to $25 million and operating expenses of $285 million to $300 million combined are unchanged.  We revised operating income guidance range of $545 million to $625 million and includes anticipated depreciation and amortization of $262 million, share-based compensation of $20 million, $61 million to $66 million related to ramp underutilization, reduced throughput and production start-up expense and a gain on the sale of our U.S. project development and North American O&M businesses of $149 million.  Turning to nonoperating items. We expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net negative $15 million, an increase of $5 million compared to our previous guidance due to higher net interest expense, foreign exchange losses. Our tax guidance of $100 million to $120 million is unchanged.  Our revised earnings per share guidance is $4 to $4.60 per share. As a reminder, there are a number of items impacting our EPS guidance for 2021. Firstly, ramp on utilization, reduced throughput and production start-up expense, driven by factory upgrades, are expected to contribute to a $0.50 EPS headwind in 2021. Secondly, these upgrades will require approximately 3 weeks of planned downtime across the fleet, which is expected to contribute to lower production. And finally, sales rate and inbound freight both remained significantly elevated in comparison to historic levels.  Our capital expenditure guidance has increased by $400 million, driven by our recently announced expansion plan to a revised range of $825 million to $875 million. As a result of additional CapEx in 2021 and high logistics costs, we decreased our year-end 2021 net cash guidance to a revised range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion.  And lastly, our shipment guidance is 7.6 to 8 gigawatts which represents a 0.2 gigawatt reduction to the low end of the guidance range.  Turning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from the call today. From a financial perspective, net cash position of $1.8 billion remained strong, delivered year-to-date EPS of $2.73, and we revised our 2021 EPS guidance range to account for the current freight market.  Operationally, we started flight preparation for our recently announced factory in Ohio and announced our manufacturing expansion into India. As a result of this expansion and optimization of our existing fleet, we anticipate our nameplate manufacturing capacity will reach 16 gigawatts in 2024. And finally, Series 6 demand is at a record high level with 9 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings, which includes 4.1 gigawatts since the previous earnings call.  And with that, we will conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : The first one is on Vietnam and Malaysia with the COVID situation there. I think, Mark, you mentioned that people are working hard and maybe even living at the facility to maintain utilization. Can you talk about how you expect utilization to trend ahead? Is there a risk for a shutdown of production at any point in time in the future? And how is this impacting your ability to roll out new updates and so forth?  And then secondarily, in terms of bookings, you guys have had some nice bookings here. There's still a bunch available for 2023. I think you mentioned maybe 3 gigawatts. When do you expect that to possibly get booked? I mean, could we see that booked later this year? Or do you think that might carry into 2022? Mark Widmar : Yes, Phil. So I guess on -- so obviously, we've got to comply with all the requirements of what's going on in both those countries. And in some cases, there's -- and there has been over periods of time in Malaysia around movement control orders. And fortunately, we've been -- and Malaysia have been deemed to be essential. So that continues to allow us to operate and we continue to try to make sure we comply with all the local requirements. We've also, in both of our facilities, started the process already to get our associates vaccinated. So most of our associates in both of the facilities have received the first shot and we'd expect here in the near term, we'd be able to provide the second shot. So that's helping as well.  Vietnam is the one that I would say that's trending more significantly, right? On a relative basis, you could look at the Vietnam historical number of cases and fatalities are being relatively low by most standards. But we've seen a pretty significant increase here over the last 6 weeks or so. So the government has made and imposed other requirements, including to the extent that you are going to continue to run your factory, there's a requirement to quarantine on site. So we have made for accommodations for our associates there to quarantine. And we've got a schedule which would be in place where we'd be able to rotate associates through over periods of times where the current staff would be quarantine for a period of time, then the new a number of assets would come in over time.  So we have been able to manage, and the team has done a phenomenal job. And I alluded to that in my prepared remarks, they continue to hit their operational metrics. So as I sit here today, as we look across our supply chain, that's both in Malaysia and Vietnam and our own facilities, we're able to manage the current situation. However, if things continue to trend worse, then we'll have to assess and evaluate our ability to continue to run and operate. So it's clearly a challenging environment at which the team have been able to do an outstanding job to continue to operate and to hit our performance metrics.  The -- as it relates to technology rollout, it's a little bit different situation because -- and we highlighted it in terms of Vietnam as it relates to our rollout of CuRe, our sequencing around CuRe would have been Ohio first then Malaysia and then Vietnam. We've already done some of the upgrades that would enable the CuRe product to be released in Malaysia when we started , we have some of the upgrades already positioned to enable CuRe when we start the rollout. And we've just recently completed the rollouts in both Perrysburg 1 and Perrysburg 2 to enable CuRe. We have yet though, to roll out the upgrades that are needed in Vietnam. And there are restrictions and quarantine requirements and reduced travel and the like. So as we alluded to, we're working through and to try to find a path to keep it on schedule, but there is a significant risk that the rollout of CuRe in Vietnam, given the current situation would be delayed. But that's the most significant one that we're still working through at this point in time. As it relates to bookings, yes, we've got about 3.4 gigawatts of 13. We now with the 2 new factories, we'll be adding close to 3 gigawatts of incremental volume in 2013 -- excuse me, get the right year 2023, sorry about that. And there's a lot of volume still to be booked. So we probably got in the range of 10 gigawatts or something like that engagement with our customers, we've got a number of very large deals right now here in the U.S. as well as in the pipeline for India. As we highlighted, we've got about 7 gigawatts right now of a pipeline in India that we're working to execute now that we've made the announcement around the factory. Subject to final permitting and the incentive programs from the government finalizing that, we'll start contracting that volume as well.  So there's no lack of opportunity. The engagement is good. I would not expect at least over the next few quarters, I don't see a significant slowdown in bookings momentum. I think we're going to have a very strong second half of this year to help start booking out 2023 and 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Lee from BOFA. Unidentified Analyst : Congrats on the bookings. For the bookings specifically, could you comment on the average ASPs as you look into '23? Is that still $0.20 -- high $0.20 per watt range? And can you talk about where you're booking into that '23-plus time frame? Mark Widmar : Yes. So what we said on the call was that if you look at our current bookings that we have for 2023, they're essentially flat. I think we said they're down about 1%. And so they're essentially flat as we go from '22 into '23. And pricing, if you actually look at the profile of what we have booked and what we're currently in negotiations with right now is pricing has trended up for both '22 -- if you look at deliveries in '22 and then even what we're seeing in '23.  So there's a lot of momentum. I think what's happening is we continue to book out again we are still somewhat capacity constrained even with the 2 new factories. That volume doesn't start to come out into '23. But even if you look at that volume relative to the global market, we are capacity constrained from that standpoint. And as our book builds up and firms up and it starts to constrain our available capacity to support new customers, it starts to firm up pricing in the marketplace. So we're happy to see that.  We -- as we said that in our prepared remarks, we do look at this as a very balanced perspective to get an ASP that's attracted to both parties, right? The project economics have to work and our return requirements have to be met as well. So you have to balance those 2 into consideration.  And the other thing I'll just say around the bookings is that we are -- and we alluded to this on the last earnings call. And if you look at effectively everything that we booked this quarter, we have started to implement the modifier around shipping costs. So we have benefited in terms of the contract structure in a way that if there's incremental sales freight costs that there would be a mechanism which that would be variable pricing to the customer to accommodate for that. So that's also an item that we're trying to make sure it gets properly reflected in our bookings as we go forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo from Baird. Benjamin Kallo : Could you talk about a little bit about what went into your guidance, the assumptions? To bring down the low end just a little bit like that seems very small. So I just want to understand what went into there as far as assumptions on shipping costs, especially and then the timing of any other plant shutdowns or costs like that?  And then my second question is just on the ASPs. What I heard you just say was that ASPs are up where you last talked to us about in your negotiations. Can you talk about if that has anything to do what that has to do with if it's supply chain? And then you also mentioned a kicker on the ASPs with the new technology. Could you maybe add more into that? Alexander Bradley : Yes, Ben, starting with the guidance. On a combined basis, you're not seeing the low end of the guidance range change. But what you are seeing is the impact of the settlement agreement that we had on the previous project come through. So the $65 million that was in the revenue line and flows straight through the gross margin. So that's a benefit to gross margin. If you look at the module side of gross margin, we're basically down about, call it, $15 million or so on volume as we lowered the lower end of the range on shipment volume and then about $65 million on freight. So it impacted in the quarter about $80 million on freight, $60 million outbound sales rate, $20 million inbound. We had about $15 million or so in the range as a risk. So we're having a net impact down of about $65 million. But again, don't forget that you had the impact coming off of this settlement agreement of $65 million. That's why the consolidated based on the range, you're not seeing it come down significantly. Mark Widmar : On the ASPs, yes, we are starting to see the ASPs for -- and I'll separate -- we'll talk next-gen product before our secondly, but first is in terms of our Series 6 and Series 6 Plus in CuRe product that we are currently negotiating with customers at this point in time. Yes, we're seeing ASPs starting to firm up. And there's -- what First Solar is able to do, not only with the differentiation we have around capabilities and our technology, but there's an element of certainty.  And given there's so much uncertainty right now that's going on with the crystalline silicon supply chain. Whether it's here in the U.S. or even you're starting to see some emerging issues start to come up in the EU and U.K. and in places like that, it's creating anxiety to a customer and the customer wants to make sure they can have certainty and there's no disruption to their commitment around their module supply chain. First Solar is decoupled from the Chinese Crystalline silicon supply chain, right? So it enables a different opportunity agent with customers and including that, that is playing into some of the opportunities.  Again, though, you still have to deliver great technology and the evolution of CuRe in particular, and it's improving around its long-term degradation rate, I think, is further enhancing our relative competitive position in the marketplace. So it's the product, it's kind of the overall market, it's the certainty of contracting with First Solar is a key driver in the bookings momentum and the firmness of the ASPs. The -- what we alluded to on our new product, which will come out of both of our Perrysburg 3 factory and in our India factory, both of them will be higher efficiency than our current fleet. They also will be optimized. One will be optimized here in the U.S. for a tracker install in the India 1, which is largely -- India is largely a fixed tilt market. It will be optimized a fixed tilt structure, both of them will inherently create incremental value relative to the Series 6 and 6 Plus product that we have today.  And I think what Alex alluded to and also couple that with both of them will be the lowest cost products in our fleet, I think there's an entitlement of $0.01 to $0.03 at least what our initial indications are about $0.01 to $0.03 of incremental gross margin realization with the next-gen product relative to where we sit today on a comparable basis with Series 6 Plus CuRe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : I had two more modeling specific ones. I guess, first off, on the cash flow trajectory here for the next few years. Can you give us a sense of what net cash balance you're comfortable with? And sort of when you get back to positive free cash flow? Is that in 2024? because there's about the informed CapEx between Ohio and India here, so just wondering kind of what the right free cash flow trajectory to be assuming is?  And then second question, just -- I know, Alex, you mentioned a lot of the OpEx is fixed. We've seen that over the years, but we typically also have seen start-up and production rate costs on new fabs. So how should we be thinking about those costs in '22 and '23 for Ohio and India, respectively? Alexander Bradley : Yes. So on the cash side, so we're guiding previously to $1.8 million to $1.9 million year-end number. That's now down to $1.35 million to $1.45 million. So $1.4 million midpoint. And the delta there is the $40 million of CapEx that's going to happen this year associated with that spend. So that still leaves another about $900 million to $1 billion or so that's going to happen in the next couple of years.  We haven't given a minimum number that we're comfortable with. I think the business is going to be significantly cash generative over the next couple of years with the 6 factories that are already in place. I can't give you a guided number. But I'd say that we're going to generate enough cash organically, that would be comfortable we could finance the construction of the June factories on Boise we wish and not drop to levels that I wouldn't be comfortable with maintaining in terms of the base net cash balance.  That said, for a few reasons, we may look to leverage the factory in India, especially. I think there's some optimization of capital structure here we might do. There's less equity going into a country where it can be more challenging to bring money in and out. I think there's some benefit to matching some of the revenue and expense stream with the capital structure. I think there's also some beneficial rates we could get using ECA financing, especially for some of the equipment is going to come out of Europe intently in the U.S. as well.  So I'm comfortable we could with organic cash flow over the next couple of years, finance the factories on balance sheet without debt and leave ourselves at levels that be comfortable with, but I think there may be optimization around the balance sheet that will look to do as well.  And then on the OpEx side, we're still working through numbers, but these factories are going to be significantly larger than the previous factories. You think about historically to put in place a factory that was $1.2 million now up to about $1.5 million, $1.6 million of nameplate somewhere in the region of $30 million to $40 million, depending on the location, depending whether it's the first or second factory came down a little bit more. For instance, our second Malaysia -- or second Vietnam factory is significantly a little cheaper than our first. It's always going to be a little higher in the U.S. than it is internationally given labor costs. But in indicative terms, you could take that and double it for scale. And so you could look at startup in the range of probably $60 million to $70 million per factory.  In terms of timing, you're going to see a significant portion of the U.S. factory start-up hit in 2022, call it, 3 quarter, something like that, the remainder in 2023. The India factory is going to be a little behind that. You may see more like 25% to 50% hit in 2022 and the other 50% to 75% hit in 2023. And the other thing I'd say about OpEx is we did mention that we have about 80% and 90% fixed operating cost structure. So as we do scale these factory, there will be potentially some slight incremental SG&A. But as a whole, as you add that 6.6 gigawatts of capacity and keep the OpEx down, we do get a pretty significant contribution margin and operating margin expansion that we can benefit from.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to First Solar's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors Section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Today the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2021 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance for 2021. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations including among other risks and uncertainties the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on slide three, I would like to start by thanking the First Solar team for their dedication and continuing execution. Operationally, despite the challenging freight and COVID-19 environment, our associates continue to deliver on their commitments. In the third quarter, we produced over two gigawatts of modules and in October, we increased our top production bin to 465 watts, which represents a 19% glass area efficiency. In parallel, we started construction of the building of our third Ohio factory and began ordering equipment for our first factory in India. Commercially, we had a good quarter increasing our record year-to-date bookings to 10.5 gigawatts. From a financial perspective, while Q3 freight costs were higher than anticipated, our full year sales freight expectation is unchanged. Shipments, which we generally define as when the delivering process to a customer commences and the module leaves one of our factories, totaled 2.1 gigawatts in Q3, which was only modestly below our expectations. Despite this total shipment results, the global freight market continues to experience record levels of scheduled delays and reliability issues. As a result, approximately 820 megawatts of modules shipped, remained in transit at quarter end, nearly double that of the preceding four quarters and were therefore not recognized as revenue in the quarter. While we expect extended transit times to continue, we anticipate our in-transit volumes to improve in Q4 as a high percentage of our shipments are expected to come from our Perrysburg factory and US distribution centers. As a result, we iterate our full year 2021 EPS guidance. Turning now to slide four, I'll provide an update on our expansion plans. As it relates to our US expansion, we started construction in mid-August after successful groundbreaking ceremony, which included bipartisan representation from state and federal government including Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh. As we continue this expansion journey, we're proud to be at the forefront of America's solar manufacturing, supporting domestic energy independence and creating good-paying middle-class jobs that will be here for years to come. Looking forward with a vertically integrated manufacturing process and a differentiated CadTel technology, we are uniquely positioned to expand our leadership role as the largest PV module manufacturer in the United States and support the nation's climate objectives. With construction underway and our schedule on target, we expect to commence initial production at the 3.3 gigawatt factory in the first half of 2023. In September, I had the privilege of meeting Prime Minister Modi in Washington D.C. to discuss India's long-term climate objectives and focus on energy independence and security, as well as opportunities for technology leadership in India. Through an ambitious target of 300 gigawatts of installed solar capacity by the end of this decade, paired with a holistic industrial and trade policy, India has created a supportive environment for companies seeking to manufacture renewable energy in country. We commend the Indian government for its leadership and believe that if every country were to take bold steps like India, our collective ability to achieve the targets within the Paris Agreement would be well within reach. With this backdrop in mind, we are excited to be expanding our manufacturing footprint into India. Overall, the site preparation is complete and we started to order equipment and the schedule is on track with the 3.3 gigawatt factory expected to commence initial production by the end of 2023. Turning to Slide 5. I'll now provide COVID-19, manufacturing, supply chain and cost updates. As a global company, we have demonstrated disciplined execution, agility and a steadfast commitment to health and safety throughout the pandemic. Reflective of this approach we have been able to maintain capacity utilization, excluding planned downtime of over 100%. Despite the challenging COVID-19 environment in Vietnam and Malaysia, our Vietnam-based manufacturing associates have been essential in the success by electing to remain on site in order to ensure manufacturing continuity.  While this very challenging period of on-site quarantine ended in late October, we acknowledged our team's resiliency, ingenuity and incredible dedication to the company's mission. Through the strength of our global associates, we continue to execute source our bill of material strategically and navigate the current environment as reflected by the manufacturing performance metrics on Slide 5. While we've delivered against our near-term production commitments travel and other COVID-19 restrictions have added constraints on getting third-party equipment installers as well as our US-based associates into Malaysia and Vietnam to perform the planned product, throughput and efficiency upgrades. We have continued to work with relevant agencies to support this essential travel in a safe manner. However the timing of upgrading our last factory Vietnam to Series 6 Plus is now expected to be completed in Q2 of next year. While I will provide a holistic update on our CuRe program later in the call the aforementioned factors have contributed to impact the implementation timing in Malaysia and Vietnam. Consistent with our expectation as of a prior earnings call, the ocean freight market globally has remained challenging due to ongoing port congestion, limited container availability, historically poor schedule reliability, higher fuel costs and other events. While shipping rates have increased since the July call, we had accounted for this expectation in our previous full year sales rate guidance which remains unchanged. As highlighted on our prior earnings call we continue to partially mitigate the effects of higher sales rate per watt through implementation and module -- improvements in module efficiency implementation of Series 6 Plus, utilization of US distribution network and freight-sharing contractual arrangements with our customers which cover a portion of expected 2022 deliveries. Despite these mitigating factors the challenging freight environment has adversely impacted our financial results. And while we have been able to maintain our global -- our module gross margin guidance for 2021, we expect freight costs to remain at current elevated levels into 2022. I would next like to provide an update on our variable bill of material spend. Although spot prices for aluminum has continued to rise since the July earnings call, we have had a commodity swap contract in place which covers the majority of our US consumption through Q4. Going forward and for our domestic and international manufacturing sites, we have several strategies and process to reduce framing costs in the near to mid-term. Firstly, by differentiating the frame design and reducing cost of modules installed in the interior versus exterior of the array; secondly by optimizing the mounting interface of our next-generation module; and finally evaluating alternative materials for construction of our frame. From a glass perspective we have largely hedged this cost through long-term fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have volumetric pricing benefits as we achieve higher levels of production. While cost uncertainty remains for certain bill of material items, our targeted 3% cost per watt sold reduction including sales rate between where we ended 2020 and expect to end 2021 is unchanged from the prior earnings call. As we mentioned while sales rate remains at elevated in excess of pre-pandemic levels, we have accounted for this in our guidance update during the previous earnings call. Regarding our end-of-year cost per watt produced target, we expect to face challenges primarily due to COVID-related delays impacting the start-up of a new glass cover factory to support our Malaysia and Vietnam factories. Additionally, we expect higher adhesive costs due to supply chain disruptions in China and a mix shift of production to higher-cost exterior modules to support projects in high wind zones. As a result of these factors, our revised year-end cost per watt produce reduction target is 5%, when compared to the prior year. Given the majority of modules produced during the fourth quarter are expected to be recognized as revenue next year this cost per watt produced headwind is not expected to impact our 2021 P&L. In aggregate, despite these near-term cost pressures, our multiyear midterm targets to reduce Series 6 bill material costs by 20% to 25% remain on track. In the United States, there are a number of items in the mix as it relates to industrial policy, trade policy and importation. While the outcome of these items remain uncertain, we continue to believe the Biden/Harris administration has a unique opportunity to produce a comprehensive strategy for solar which could include a mix of manufacturing tax credits, an extension of the investment tax credit with the domestic content requirement and enforcement of responsible solar among other strategies. Through a long-term strategic approach to policy the administration has the opportunity to create an environment that not only helps secure America's sustainable energy future in a manner that reflects our country's values and principles, but also fosters innovation for the next generation of PV to be developed and manufactured in the United States. As it relates to trade policy, we continue to monitor developments related to the petition to extend Section 201 tariffs and to investigate whether certain solar manufacturers have circumvented antidumping and countervailing duties. As it relates to importation, we have repeatedly and unequivocally condemn the reported use of forced labor in the crystalline silicon PV supply chain. We continue to do so, as long as it remains an issue. During the previous earnings call we indicated that the issue necessitates swift and resolute action, but also emphasize that it should present an impetus for the United States and like-minded nations to separate their climate goals from the over-reliance on one country and one PV technology. No country should be forced to choose between fighting climate change and standing up for its principles such as, safeguarding human rights and securing this energy independence. While we acknowledge the challenges presented by the withhold release order issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in June of this year, there are practical commercial solutions to reduce the risk of purchasing modules associated with forced labor and uncertain trade policy outcomes. For example, one of our peers has recently established a vertically integrated supply chain from polysilicon to module assembly outside of China without direct or indirect ties to Xinjiang. While this is a small step and only impacts a portion of the overall operation we believe it is a meaningful step in the right direction. Two essential attributes of PV power plants are their environmental benefits and their zero ongoing fuel consumption as compared to thermal generation. While the economic competitiveness of solar continues to drive an acceleration of global adoption many international markets including China rely on coal firepower for the majority of their electricity generation. Due to supply chain challenges and geopolitical factors, China is experiencing a coal shortage that has resulted in higher energy prices and government-mandated power restrictions against parts of the manufacturing sector. Given the majority of global polysilicon capacity is located in Mainland China higher coal costs mandated reductions in energy consumption and reduced operating capacity have further exacerbated the supply and demand imbalance in the polysilicon market, contributing to an ongoing increase in pricing for both polysilicon and solar modules. This coupled with the challenging freight environment has caused many Chinese-based manufacturers to prioritize availability of solar module supply to the local market where the major investors in utility-scale solar are the country's state-owned enterprises. This is yet another potent reminder of the risk of having climate goals tethered to supply chains that lead, a single nation in the PV technology and demonstrates the irony of America's clean energy transition currently being hindered by reliance on coal to produce crystalline silicon solar modules. Turning to slide 6, I'll next discuss our most recent bookings in greater detail. We had a good quarter with bookings of 1.5 gigawatts since the previous earnings call. After accounting for shipments of approximately 2.1 gigawatts during the third quarter, our future expected shipments which extended into 2024 are 16.5 gigawatts. Including our year-to-date bookings we are sold out for 2022 at 4.2 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2023 and 0.3 gigawatts in 2024. While our energy quality and environmental advantages are all key differentiators, customers have been placing a premium on our vertically integrated manufacturing process, supply chain transparency and zero tolerance for the use of forced labor in our supply chain. We are seeing our value proposition drive interest in multiyear framework agreements. With a robust and several active negotiations with customers in the United States and India for multiyear and multi-gigawatt agreements, we are pleased with the robust demand for our CadTel technology. At the time of our previous earnings call, we had indicated the ASP across our volume for potential deliveries in 2023 was 1% lower than the volume to be shipped in 2022. Including our incremental bookings since the previous earnings call, our 2023 ASP is largely unchanged. In summary, we have seen a significant increase in the desire to work with First Solar due to our differentiated value proposition of more value with less work. While many of our crystalline silicon competitors have reportedly canceled deliveries have prioritized shipments into the domestic Chinese market and have openly requested price increases and delayed shipments we however continue to stand behind our contractual commitments. With this backdrop in mind, we are seeing bookings momentum with customers who value our technology advantages the benefits of domestically produced product and our responsible solar principles. Additionally as reflected on slide 7 our pipeline of future opportunities also remains robust. Our total bookings opportunities is 45 gigawatts with 21 gigawatts in mid to late-stage customer engagement. Note our capacity expansion in India and the related increase in available supply to meet projected domestic demand has increased our bookings opportunity in India to over 17 gigawatts, a 10 gigawatt increase since our Q2 earnings call. Before turning the call over to Alex I would like to provide an update on our technology road map. Looking forward, CuRe represents an anticipated enhancement to our module performance, which is expected to increase efficiency and reduce long-term degradation. On the April earnings call we indicated the CuRe lead line implementation was anticipated by Q4 of 2021 and fleet-wide by the end of Q1 2022. On the July call, we indicated CuRe implementation in Vietnam required international travel from third-party equipment installers as well as our US-based associates. Regarding Malaysia we were in the process of implementing the required CuRe upgrades but not all have been completed as of the end of the July call. In July through September COVID-19 cases began to significantly increase as the Delta variant spread and government restrictions were put in place in parts of Southeast Asia. As it relates to our CuRe development program, we have demonstrated the product's full performance entitlement in a lab setting and are currently working to translate this potential into high-volume production in Ohio. While this trend for improving module wattage and degradation appears favorable we are still working to realize the full performance entitlement in high-volume manufacturing conditions. We are continuing to refine our production parameters in order to bridge this gap relative to the program objectives for CuRe. As a result of the aforementioned challenges, our integration schedule is delayed and we have revised our integration schedule to the lead line implementation by the end of Q1 2022. Fleet-wide replication timing will be determined upon completion of implementation of the lead line and factory equipment upgrades required for CuRe. While CuRe has been delayed this presents a window of opportunity to leverage the optionality in our technology road map and demonstrate the resiliency of our vertically integrated manufacturing process. Through product enhancements to our current Series 6 technology we have increased our top production bin to 465 watts which represents a 19% glass area efficiency and produced over 125 megawatts with 460-watt modules during October. In addition to improved efficiency in module wattage, Series 6 is expected to have a significantly improved long-term degradation rate. Using improved metrology to measure degradation at our test sites and further validate by third-party analytical methods and customer site data, the current Series 6 platform is expected to have a 30-year degradation rate of 0.3% per year, which is 40% below our previous expectation. While the improved Series 6 nameplate wattage is in line with our target to exit 2021 with a top production bin of 460 to 465 watts, its energy performance including a slightly higher long-term degradation rate and higher temperature coefficient is below the expected performance of CuRe. In connection with our CuRe obligation starting in Q1 of next year, we have either amended or will endeavor to amend certain customer contracts utilizing CuRe technology by substituting our Enhanced Series 6 product. In connection with these customer contract amendments we may make certain price concessions. We currently estimate that the price concessions that we will potentially will make across the impact of customer contracts will not exceed approximately $100 million of 2022 revenue. Despite these challenges, we are encouraged by the promise of CuRe technology. Through the relentless focus and persistence of our manufacturing technology teams, we believe CuRe's performance on the manufacturing line will continue to improve. We will discuss the full year 2022 impacts during our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our third quarter financial and 2021 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 8, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the third quarter. Net sales in Q3 were $584 million, a decrease of $46 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower systems segment revenue, which was partially offset by an increase in module segment revenue. On a segment basis, our module segment revenue in Q3 was $563 million compared to $543 million in the prior quarter. Systems segment gross margin in Q3 was $6 million, which was largely driven by a favorable settlement related to a legacy systems project. Module segment gross margin was 21% in Q3 compared to 20% in Q2. There are several positive and negative factors that impacted this Q3 result. Firstly, we recorded a reduction in our product warranty liability, which was primarily due to lower claims than previously estimated for our Series 2 and Series 6 modules. This resulted in a $33 million reduction of our warranty liability, a corresponding benefit to cost of sales. Secondly, certain of our legacy module sale agreements are covered by a collection and recycling program or a corresponding expense to the estimated future cost of our obligation was recognized at the time of sale. During Q3, we recognized an $11 million increase in our module collection and recycling liability due to changes in the expected value of certain recycling byproducts. Thirdly as mentioned, we're in the process of implementing factory upgrades in 2021, which requires downtime resulting in lower production and underutilization. In Q3, our module segment gross margin was impacted by $6 million of underutilization. On a net basis, these factors increased module segment gross margin dollars and percent by $16 million and three percentage points respectively. Separately, whilst we continue to navigate and partially mitigate the effects of the dislocated shipping market, higher freight costs impacted our financial results for the quarter. In Q3, sales rate totaled approximately $67 million. Along with module warranty expense of approximately $1 million, sales rate and warranty reduced our module segment gross margin by approximately 12 percentage points. And note, as a reminder, many of our module peers report freight cost as a separate operating expense. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider this factor when benchmarking our module gross margin relative to our peers. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $69 million in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $9 million compared to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily driven by a $3 million impairment charge related to a certain project development in Japan, $2 million increase in R&D expense, predominantly related to CuRe testing and a lower net benefit of $2 million from reductions to our expected credit losses in Q3 as compared to Q2. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses, totaled $3 million in Q3 compared to $2 million in the prior quarter. Q3 operating income was $51 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $66 million $9 million related to underutilization and production start-up expense and share-based compensation of $6 million. Recorded tax expense of $1 million in the third quarter compared to $20 million in Q2. Decrease in tax expense for Q3 is driven largely by lower pre-tax income a shift in our jurisdictional mix of income and lower estimated taxes in certain jurisdictions. And the combination of the aforementioned items led to third quarter earnings per share of $0.42 and $3.16 for the first three quarters of 2021 on a diluted basis. Next turn to Slide 9, to discuss balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.9 billion a decrease of $111 million compared to the prior quarter. There are several factors impacting our quarter end cash balance. Firstly in Q1, we sold certain marketable securities associated with our module collection and recycling program for total proceeds of $259 million, which were presented as restricted cash on our balance sheet and were therefore included in our measure of total cash at the end of Q1 and 2. During Q3, these proceeds were reinvested and are now represented on our balance sheet as restricted marketable securities which are not included in our measure of total cash. Secondly, net cash generated by operating activities was $305 million, which included collection of proceeds from a $65 million settlement agreement related to a legacy systems project that was reached in Q2. Finally this was offset by capital expenditures of $165 million during Q3. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $279 million, which was consistent with the prior quarter. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project-related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding project is sold. Our net cash position which includes cash, cash equivalents restricted cash and marketable securities less debt decreased by $111 million to $1.7 billion, as a result of, the aforementioned factors. Net working capital in Q3, which includes noncurrent project assets and excludes cash, cash equivalents marketable securities decreased by $296 million compared to the prior quarter. And this decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in accounts receivable related to the aforementioned settlement agreement collection of receivables related to prior project sales. Net cash generated by operating activities of $305 million in the third quarter compared to $177 million in the prior quarter and capital expenditures were $165 million in the third quarter compared to $91 million in the prior quarter.  Continuing on Slide 10, I'll discuss 2021 guidance. In comparison to our initial expectations coming into 2021 our year-to-date performance reflects the strength of the business model but also tremendous execution during the course of the year. While the effects of higher freight costs were partially offset by the aforementioned settlement related to our legacy systems project, our current earnings per share guidance is largely within the range we provided during the February earnings call. Relative to year-to-date EPS of $3.16 to $4.30 midpoint of our current full-year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS of $1.14 compared to $0.42 in the third quarter. There are several factors driving this quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share and our ability to reiterate our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. Firstly, approximately 820 megawatts of modules remained in transit at quarter end and were not recognized as revenue during Q3. While extended transit times impacted our Q3 results, we anticipate a significant portion of these modules will be recognized as revenue in early Q4. Driven by a strong start to the fourth quarter we anticipate an increase in module volume sold during Q4.  Secondly, while freight costs in Q4 are expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels, we had accounted for this expectation and the guidance we provided on the July earnings call. As a result, our sales rate guidance for full-year 2021 of 10 to 11 percentage points of gross margin module gross margin remains unchanged.  Thirdly, we remain on track to complete the sale of certain Japanese systems projects in Q4 contributing to an expected increase in Systems segment revenue and gross margin compared to Q3. So with that context, I'll next discuss the updated guidance ranges in some more detail.  Our revenue gross margin guidance remain unchanged. And note that our gross margin continues to include the impact of $61 million to $66 million of ramp and utilization and reduced throughput costs. SG&A and R&D expenses of $265 million to $275 million production start-up expense of $20 million to $25 million and operating expenses of $285 million to $300 million are unchanged. Our operating income guidance range of $545 million to $625 million is unchanged and includes anticipated depreciation and amortization of $258 million, share based compensation of $21 million, $61 million to $66 million related to ramp on utilization reduced throughput and production start-up expense, and a gain on the sale of our US project development in North American O&M businesses of approximately $150 million. Our full year 2021 EPS guidance also remains unchanged. Our capital expenditure guidance is $675 million to $725 million, which represents a $150 million decrease relative to our previous expectations. And this is primarily related to the expected timing of certain factory upgrades. Our year-end 2021 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion. This $100 million increase relative to our previous expectations is primarily due to the reduction in our CapEx guidance. And lastly our shipment guidance of 7.6 to eight gigawatts is unchanged. Turning to slide 11, I'll summarize key messages from the call. From a financial perspective, we delivered year-to-date EPS of $3.16. Our full year 2021 EPS guidance is unchanged and our net cash position of $1.7 billion remains strong. From a manufacturing perspective, we produced over two gigawatts despite the challenging COVID-19 environment, increased our top production bin to 465 watts and have revised our CuRe implementation schedule. And finally Series 6 demand remains at record levels with 10.5 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings, which includes 1.5 gigawatts since the previous earnings call. With that we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three groups of questions. The first one is around bookings and pricing. I was wondering, if you could provide a little bit more color on that. Looking ahead do you expect to accelerate or perhaps slow down bookings to maximize price? And then are you looking to make any changes to the way you structure your contracts, so you can maximize your pricing? Number two here, as it relates to the reconciliation bill, you have the $0.04 per watt thin film sell credit but then there's also the $0.07 module credit for the manufacturing production tax credit. Can you talk about -- do you think you get both added together, or do you think one or the other? And then finally as it relates to capacity expansion maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about it? And do you need that reconciliation bill before you guys think about the next leg of capacity in Ohio or elsewhere in the US and what conditions in general you think you might need to announce another capacity expansion? Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : All right. Thanks Phil. I'll try to hit on all three of those. In terms of bookings -- and first of all what I'd like to say about the bookings if you look at our pipeline of opportunities that we highlighted in the presentation, we effectively -- if you look at our mid to late stage opportunities have doubled. I think our last quarter we were right around nine gigawatts now we're sitting at 21 gigawatts, so more than double that. And we've almost tripled the opportunities that we have in the US last quarter, we were six and change on the US for mid to late-stage in this quarter we're sitting north of 18. So I feel really good about the robustness and the opportunity for us. And then what's encouraging I somewhat indicated in my prepared remarks is that -- these are multiyear agreements, multi-gigawatt agreements a number of them are. And we are working a framework there that has construct that allows for optionality in our roadmap to make sure that we can be monetized. So we talked on the last call, for example, that we are looking to now enable bifaciality for CadTel. So to the extent that we do that then there's a predetermined value lever that is associated with that bifaciality and then it drives to accretion to the ASP. There's other components in there that are structured such that for domestic content requirements that may evolve with the ITC there's an associated value lever associated with that. So I'm really happy with the engagement that we're seeing right now, not only here in the U.S. but obviously in India. I mean to have a 17 gigawatts of opportunities in India already, just after only a little over a quarter or so since we've announced the factory expansion. It's really nice to see that level of engagement involvement and robustness that we have for our India factory. So we are encouraged. We are also -- I would say that the sales cycle customer engagement is probably a little bit longer, partly because we are looking multi-years out into the horizon and we're also trying to create the optionality and we're also trying to make sure we've got good visibility with all the various levers that could come into the mix, whether it's tariff, trade policies, whether it's industrial policies, we want to make sure that we have clarity around some of those levers as we start to enter into some of these contracts. Encouraged by the pricing. If you look at where we are and how pricing is firming up here in the U.S. And even what we're seeing in India is it becomes more of a domestic manufacturing market, we're encouraged by what we're seeing there as well. So all that, I would say, put us very positive and trending in the right direction. The reconciliation bill and in particular the manufacturing tax credit, the spirit and the intent of that has been to be additive. So the components are additive. We -- there has been some additional clarifying language that I believe was push forward in a manager's amendment yesterday to make sure there is clarity that it is additive. We believe its additive for the cell and module level at a minimum and is being evaluated whether potentially could be additive beyond that. So we're encouraged by that. We think the bill is structured in a way that it will provide the domestic capability that we need to ensure our self-reliance and long-term energy independence and security. So that's obviously moving in the right direction. That's still -- a long way still to go to get it all the way over the finish line, but the way it's constructed right now, we're very encouraged by them. And we think it will enable the long-term strategic objectives we need as a nation. Capacity expansion, Phil, we've already been working with our tool suppliers. We kind of got them on this six-month window. We've got Perrysburg expansion first and then six months later the India expansion and then we've already been working with them to think through another factory within six months after that, which would effectively say that we could bring another factory online sometime early 2024, depending on where it could be, it could be here in the U.S. it could be in India, it could be somewhere else. But we are trying to make sure that we have that forward visibility of what we're looking for in ensuring that that capability will be there if we made the decision to expand beyond our current commitments on capacity. Alex Bradley : So the only other thing I'd add is that, we talked about the potential for putting some debt on the balance sheet associated with the additional factories we're looking at right now. Given the policy environment we're seeing the ASP environment we're seeing, if we added additional capacity, that would obviously be very cash-generative, but there may be a bridge where that would be helpful in terms of the timing of CapEx, let's say, with those new factories before they came online. So as we think about the balance sheet and how we look at funding the amount of capacity already, that might impact how we look at it, depending on whether we see the possibility for additional capacity beyond currently in our factories. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it. So just to follow up on Phil's questions. First off, just looking at the year, the guidance, just confidence on shipments in 4Q? I know you said there was some already slipping from 3Q to 4Q. But just what are you seeing in port congestion, just the ability to deliver all together. I'll leave it open-ended. I know there's a lot of different pieces there, but clearly you're saying you've got some amount of visibility and confidence there. And then separately, I'll throw them all together here for ease of just going on the list. Coming back to the ability to qualify for certain subsidies here, how are you thinking about PLI in India, just as far as that goes in qualifying specifically for your expansion? And then lastly, any commentary on pricing, specifically on 2023. Again, I know that you just asked a little bit on maximizing it, but just aggregate level how much -- what trends are we seeing here on 2023 and especially 2024, as you start to see some of this backfilled and potentially contemplate ITC, et cetera? Alex Bradley : Hey, Julien. I\u2019ll start on the shipment fee. So I would say, we're seeing poor congestion and general issues in the shipping market, be as bad today as we've seen them. So I don't see any improvement, if you look at the cost of sales rate we indicated for the quarter, that's still raised. I would say though that absent -- we still see some issues around blank sailings. In general, I have good confidence in our shipment numbers for the year. The delta comes a little bit in how much will that will be put through the P&L in terms of revenue recognized. So if you look at Q3, we managed to hit our expected shipment numbers, but we were low to the tune of somewhere around 300 to 400 megawatts in terms of the expected volume of revenue recognized and that's a function of transit times. So if you go back to pre-pandemic times, we would normally see from factory gate to revenue recognition about two months from product leaving our Asia factories. That's increased by about 50%. So we're seeing closer to 90 days now for product coming from Asia into the US. So I think from a volume shifts, I've got a lot of confidence. And if you think about where we are today effectively for product coming from Asia, if it hasn't left the factory already, it's not going to get to destination, if it's the US by the end of the year. So we have reasonable clarity there. But again, the timing of the rev rec is a little bit different. Now we do expect to catch up a little bit on the rev rec side in the fourth quarter, partly of the mix shift. So we see a little more expected volumes to be revenue recognized coming from either Perrysburg or our US distribution center. There's also a slight mix shift in terms of income terms in there as well. So good confidence on shipments still a bit of uncertainty on revenue recognition. Mark Widmar : Yeah. And I guess on the PLI Julien, first off, I'd just like to reference again as I said in my prepared remarks, it was a pleasure to get a chance to spend some time with Prime Minister Modi in D.C. And we talked through this a little bit and he's very encouraged that First Solar is making a commitment to India and creates basically a footprint of diversification that they're looking for, right? So we are completely decoupled from a Chinese supply chain. And we're a vertically integrated factory within the four walls. And so to truly enable kind of their focus on concern around overreliance, concern about energy independence and security we're really a strategic enabler of that accomplishing that. His commitment to me was during their conversation was that he would ensure we would get our fair share of the PLI. So I feel encouraged by that statement and that commitment. The PLI is still being worked through. There is some -- the first request for the PLI have been made. If you look at the scoring -- our current scoring would not necessarily indicate we would receive an allocation of PLI, but we are working through that. The -- his administration is also looking to expand beyond what was originally allocated to -- because there was such an overwhelming request to expand the funding requirements for PLI. So -- and there's also potentially another path that we could pursue that would give an equivalent PLI benefit even though it wasn't directly funded through the PLI program. So we're working on different options. As I said before, our business case was not predicated on receiving the PLI. If we received it, it was a benefit and an upside. We have other incentives that are moving forward. We're receiving an incentive for our CapEx that we're spending on the factory which is a 24% credits that we'll receive to offset the cost of that capital. There's other incentives that we're receiving related to labor. There's a 10-year incentive for a 20% rebate against our cost of labor and there are some other incentives that we are pursuing and those are all trending green. So PLI right now is still being managed. I still believe we'll be able to find an outcome that will be a positive outcome for us. But even without it we still are very confident with our business case in India and our relative competitiveness of our new product and our new factory in the India market. Pricing for 2023 what I would say is that where we are marking it currently right now is encouraging. And especially with the value levers that I referenced as potential upside as well. We are encouraged by what we're seeing and we feel very confident in our ability to see a very attractive pricing not only 2023, 2024 and then potentially into 2025 as we enter into some of these long-term agreements. Alex Bradley : Yeah. The other thing I'd add just on that is its pricing and also risk terms. So there is a view of changing risk profile around sales rate for instance that we're looking at in 2023 relative to historical contracts. So may not necessarily influence the overall ASP but does change the risk shift especially in the market we're seeing sales rate being a higher cost today. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: You said you're getting a premium ASP for your risk or you're not recognizing a premium for your risk factors? Alex Bradley : We're looking -- we're changing the allocation of risk and contracts so that we have sharing or pass-through of certain costs to the customers given the uncertainty around shipment. Mark Widmar : So, if you think of it this way. I mean look freight cost right now is up 70%, 80%, 90%. And so we've kind of created a level of which we're willing to accept but a high percentage of that will now be passed through directly to our customers versus us sharing or carrying that entire risk on our ledger. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Great to hear that. Congrats again. Speak soon. Mark Widmar : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of J.B. Lowe with Citi. Mr. Lowe, your line is open. J.B. Lowe: Good afternoon. How are you doing? Alex Bradley : Well. thank you. J.B. Lowe: My question was on given all the moving parts we have between what you have booked for 2022, the ASPs that you have already locked in and kind of the moving pieces of costs that we have flowing through at this point shipping and otherwise, how do you think gross margin per watt should trend in 2022 versus 2021? Alex Bradley : So, if you look through the various moving pieces across the year, so Mark in his prepared remarks mentioned that there'll be some impact from our timing around CuRe. There'll be some specific impact related to that timing. We also will see some impact from overall cost per watt. So, the factory upgrades not only impact CuRe, but impact overall cost per watt. Without them we have less watts. Therefore, we have less amortization of fixed costs going across the capacity we have. We've seen commodity price pressures. So, I think in the prepared remarks, we talked about our year-over-year cost watt produced being down about 5% versus our previous expectation of 9%. That's mostly bill of materials issues. On the long-term, we believe that gets resolved but we do see short-term pressure especially on the aluminum side. From a sales rate perspective, I would say that you're going to see the run rate you're seeing in the second half of this year most likely carry forward into next year. So, no sequential increase forecast today, but higher relative to pre-pandemic levels. If you look in 2022 overall as well, it's going to be the first year we don't have the US Systems business, although we will have some contribution from Japan on a company-wide gross margin level you're going to see some impact of that. And then I'd say the other piece you're going to see is the flip side of not having that US Systems business the strategic decision we made to exit was accompanied by a growth decision and you're going to see that come through later. But in 2022, we haven't yet got additional capacity in the US or in India online, but you are going to see the costs associated with that in terms of startup and ramp costs coming through. We talked on the last call about that being somewhere in the range of $60 million to $70 million per factory combined start-up and ramp and you'd see I think a little bit more than half of that total coming through in 2022 with the remainder coming in 2023. So, you're going to see some pressure on -- across the board in 2022. What I would say is if you then look forward and take that through into 2023, most of those short-term challenges don't tell the longer-term story. So, the CuRe delay that we talked about that impact will be felt from 2022 not in 2023. By 2023, you'll have over half of the ramp and start-up for the India and the US factory, which will have been spent sequentially year-on-year. Going 2022 to 2023, you're going to see a decrease in startup and ramp. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, ASPs right now we're seeing 2022 to 2023 are essentially flat in the backlog. And at the time when we have got pretty strong macro tailwinds right now on the bookings. We would expect sea cost per watt come down over the two years. From a volume produced and sold perspective, you're going to see volume come up as the factories come online in 2023. You're also going to see Series 7 come through. Right now we're not booking for that. As we mentioned on our last call, we expect to see about a $0.01 to $0.03 gross margin entitlement advantage associated with Series 7 relative to Series 6 and that's a benefit split across ASP cost per watt in sales rate. And then lastly on the sales rate side, you're going to see a benefit again in 2023 relative to 2022. I just talked about the contractual shift that we're making whereby we are capping effectively the amount of sales risk we take and the passing remainder through to customers. So, you are going to see that by virtue of a lot of those things an impact to gross margin in 2022 a lot of which will reverse out in 2023 and we'll give you more clarity and visibility into that when we give guidance in February. J.B. Lowe: Awesome. Thanks. My other question was just on -- given all the pricing headwinds we've seen or cost headwinds we've seen, is there any change to the outlook for CapEx required to build the new facilities or timing of such? Mark Widmar : Yeah. So look, there's a lot of moving pieces in the CapEx right now for both of the factories and some positive and some challenging, right? And one of the unfortunate reality of sales rate or freight in general I should say, carries itself all the way through our tool set and delivering of those tool sets to our factories, right? So we are seeing some higher costs there. We've seen some other benefits relative to our original assumptions around the equipment cost that are more favorable. So, as we review, which we do every month the status of those two expansions and then the relative CapEx relative to the goals and also what we committed externally. The numbers are still lining up. The thing that could impact schedule per se would be long delayed in transit delivery schedule of the equipment set. And so we are trying to get ahead of that and we're trying to move that forward. And we've accommodated for some longer in-transit delivery times. But everything we see as of right now, we're still on target basically within the budget which we've communicated externally as well as the schedule when those factories will be up and operational. J.B. Lowe: Helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird. Ben Kallo : Thank you. So if we did have the -- I don't know if we call it an as of manufacturing credit, but if we had that how do you guys monetize that is my first question. Can you use that yourself, or do you get a tax equity partner or how does that work? And then, how big do we think that is? Mark Widmar : So first off, the way it's been structured right now, Ben, it's a refundable tax credit. So we don't have to have sufficient tax capacity to monetize it. To the extent we do have a tax liability then the credit would have offset that portion. And to the extent the credit was in excess of our tax liability then it would be a refundable credit that would be paid back to us by the US government. Ben, it's -- you can do the math, right? And the numbers can be pretty significant at $0.11 a watt. I mean you take $0.11 a watt across our US capacity, call it, three gigawatts for the US without the expansion. And then with the expansion you had another 3.3 gigawatts. So we're a little bit north of 6 gigawatts, in the way that it would work right now again with the module and the cell being additive, then you would be entitled to $0.11 for every watt of which we ship to produce and ship after beginning, let's say, it this way beginning January 1, 2022. So anything that we're producing right now would not be eligible for that even though it would potentially ship next year. But anything that we produce next year and ship then we would be entitled to a credit that as it currently is positioned would be a minimum of $0.11 a watt. Ben Kallo : Got it. And then, just with the uncertainty with this not shipping costs and financing costs and everything else. But how are customers -- I get this question a lot like how much stuff gets pushed out to next year to wait and see or what have you? And thank you, guys. Mark Widmar : So the one issue with us is that we're not seeing a lot of stuff moving. And the -- what's happening right now is unfortunately -- obviously not all of our customers are 100%. There are a couple which I do thank them very much. So the fact they're 100% committed to First Solar's technology but not all of them are. And they're getting reneged on or pushed out by our competitors. And so in some cases if they have a commitment with us on the books and the project discretely which that was associated with may be moving they're looking to take that volume and allocate it to another project that they're unable to get module supply for. So for us it's not much of an impact because nobody wants to give up the opportunity that they've got secured right now with us. And so what they're doing is taking delivery of modules and then using them in other projects. So I know others are seeing that impact. I know projects truly are slipping or getting pushed out. We're just not seeing much of that impact yet. Ben Kallo : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the Japan project could you just talk about how much of EPS sensitivity do you expect from that? And just in terms of certainty what are you thinking about it? And could you just also talk more about the CuRe delay and improvements and how much the impact there is? I think you spoke about $100 million previously. Just wanted to clarify that for 2022. Thanks. Alex Bradley : Yes, this is Alex. I'll take quickly the -- we've guided to about $55 million to $70 million of gross margin assumption for Q4 associated with Japan assets. Mark Widmar : Yes. As it relates to CuRe. So where we are with CuRe right now again there's two challenges, right? And one is our ability and the timing to replicate. We were in the process of upgrading our factories Malaysia, Vietnam to enable the CuRe production process which there are certain tools the oven in particular that has to be upgraded. And we have not been able to do that with the restrictions that have been placed on us because of the COVID pandemic and the Delta variant spread in the way that it has over the last several months things are getting better. So that's obviously all positive. But that's been a huge constraint and that delays our ability to roll out. Now before that even as we sit with where the solution development phase is right now we are behind where we want to be as it relates to -- if you think about the attributes of CuRe what's the value of CuRe? Well first and foremost is the improved long-term degradation rate. The other is higher efficiency. And then finally, it's the better temperature coefficient. So we've actually closed the gap between our existing product and the CuRe degradation rate which we highlighted on the call that now we're at a 0.3 annual degradation rate based off of the studies that we've done and further validation with third-party methodologies that we're at 0.3 and we'll go forward with 0.3 right now but that's still higher than our 0.2. It's best-in-class industry, but not to the level that CuRe was going to take us to. The efficiency, at least as we exit this year we're recovered about two bins on efficiency with our existing products. So we've closed a little bit of that gap, but we're slightly off on efficiency from where we want to be. And then, on the temperature coefficient, so we are -- the temperature coefficient is not as favorable with our existing product is where we want to be with CuRe. Now we've been able to validate through our laboratory work as well as individually each one of those attributes through our pilot line. But when we take it into high-volume manufacturing there are certain attributes that are becoming more challenging as we try to take it into high-volume manufacturing. One is the handling of the product. So the -- I would say the film is not as resilient yet, as our current device is and therefore handling becomes much more of a concern. So we've got to work through that, two ways. One is to improve potentially how we handle the product in the production process the other is, to make the film a little bit more resilient to enable that to happen. The other is it is currently the atmosphere and the effects of humidity in particular is a little bit more challenging than what we have with our existing products. So we've got to work through that. So we know we can solve each one of those. It's just a matter of time and to do it in high-volume manufacturing. And that means we're going to have to run. And so that's part of it. We've been doing runs. And we've been doing designs of experiments to validate and learn and evolve. So it's a matter of finalizing that effort. It's not an issue with the viability of the technology, as we've seen demonstrated either through the laboratory work or even the pilot line or we call it a quip line validation of those discrete attributes that we need in order to get to the program objectives for CuRe. And so we're working through each and every one of those. And our current view is right now we'll have our lead lineup and running by the end of Q1 of 2022. And then from there, once we have that validated then we'll make a decision on the replication throughout the balance of the fleet as well as the \u2013 hopefully, we're seeing some positive signs of ability to travel and to get in country into Vietnam and Malaysia to start the upgrade process. So once we have that validation through our lead line, we can start the replication process but that is still a constraint. We need to be able to get in country to upgrade the tool sets. And if unfortunately over the winter months, we see a new variant or something else that comes through and we're unable to travel in country then that's going to create further delays that we'll have to manage. What we have right now is the range that we've given to these are all going to be subject to negotiations with customers that we're going to have to work through. And we started them. Some of them have been pretty positive. Some of them have not, been as positive. And so we felt it was prudent to provide some potential impact to the extent that we are delayed in the rollout that we could see some adverse impact to our revenue next year, which if you look at the volume which we're going to ship next year we're talking somewhere around $0.01. But when you take a $0.01 across eight to nine gigawatts of shipments it becomes a pretty material impact pretty quickly. So we just wanted to make sure that it was transparent. Maheep Mandloi : Thanks. Operator : And this does conclude our allotted time for questions-and-answers. And this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to First Solar\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors Section of First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Ennis, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. Today the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results as well as its guidance for 2022 [phonetic]. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Following his remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy outlook. Alex will then discuss our financial guidance for 2022. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations including among other risks and uncertainties the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today\u2019s press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the entire First Solar team for their hard work and perseverance in a year where much of the solar manufacturing industry faced supply chain, logistics, cost, and pandemic-related challenges. Despite these dynamics, we have continued to scale our manufacturing capacity and adapt our business model in a constantly evolving market. Through our points of differentiation, which include our cad-tel thin-film module technology, a vertically integrated continuous manufacturing process, a strong balance sheet and a commitment to the principles of responsible solar, we have traded a growth-oriented business model, which we believe positions us to be successful over the long term. While Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview of our 2021 financial results, I would like to highlight that our full year EPS results of $4.38 per diluted share came in above the midpoint or guidance range we provided at this time during our third quarter earnings call. Of note this EPS result, despite an unprecedented challenging freight environment is also solidly within the original guidance range we provided last February.  Beginning on slide three, I\u2019ll highlight some of our key 2021 accomplishments, which we believe positions us for sustainable growth. To begin, we had an excellent year from a commercial perspective securing a record 17.5 gigawatts of net bookings in 2021, more than double our prior annual record. This momentum has carried into 2022 with 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings year today, which brings our total since the previous earnings calls to 11.8 gigawatts. As we secure this very significant volume for delivery into the future, we have been employing a contracting strategy which enables our customers to benefit from the evolution of our product and technology platform, while also partially de-risking our position around sales freight [phonetic]. I will discuss this approach later in the call. We produced 7.9 gigawatts in 2021, delivering against our near-term commitments, despite pandemic-related challenges. Moreover, we reduced our cost per watt produced water by 6% between the end of 2020 and 2021, despite inflationary pressures, rising commodity costs, and as a result of the COVID-19, the inability to implement as planned several module cost reduction program. Expansion has been an important thing in 2021. As we set the foundation to reach approximately 16 gigawatts of capacity in 2024, we added our sixth Series 6 factory, our second factory in Malaysia in early 2021, announced plans for new factories to produce our next generation of solar panels, which we are calling Series 7 in India and Ohio. As a reminder, the two Series 7 factories are expected to come online in 2023 and combined with combining with their benefit of locating supply near to demand, reducing the cost of sales freight, are expected to increase gross profit per watt by approximately $0.01 to $0.03 relative to our existing Series 6 fleets. On the technology front, we increased our top Series 6 production bin to 465 watts, which represents a 21% [phonetic] increase year-over-year as in line with our guidance provided last February. We reduced our 30-year warranted power output degradation rate from 0.5% to 0.3% per year. This meaningful improvement can result in the module yield we\u2019ll have to 4.4% more energy on a lifecycle basis. And finally, we completed the sale of our US project development and North American O&M businesses. In summary, each of these achievements are the result of our intent to focus on our greatest competitive advantage, which includes our differentiated technology and manufacturing process. Turning to Slide 4, I will next discuss our most recent shipments and bookings in greater detail. We shipped approximately 2.1 gigawatts and 7.7 gigawatts for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 respectively, which was within but towards the lower end of our guidance range that we provided during the Q3 earnings call. As a reminder, we generally define shipment as when the delivery process to a customer commences and the module leaves one of our facilities, whereas revenue recognition or volume sold occurs this transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which is commonly upon the arrival at the destination port of the project size. Now, extended transit time due to container availability constraints contributed to our full year 2021 shipments being towards the lower end of our guidance range. The global freight market continues to experience record levels of scheduled delays and reliability issues, which has worsened since the previous earnings call. Due these challenges, we ended the year with 1.2 gigawatts of inventory on hand and 675 megawatts of shipments in transit not recognized as revenue. While the volume in transit declined quarter-over-quarter, it was meaningfully above the trailing 12-quarter average.  Several logistic challenges trended unfavorably in Q4. Firstly, total transit times for transoceanic freight increased by a factor of weeks between Q3 and Q4 reaching levels nearly double historic norms. Secondly, congestion continues to be challenging at US ports, which are further exasperated in advance of the holiday season. Thirdly, reliability was a significant issue as three in 10 planned sailings were canceled around the turn of the year. Finally, over the road trucking is constrained from a capacity perspective with load to truck ratios at the highest level in several years. In summary, we are experiencing a two-front impact related to freight in terms of both higher costs and worst carrier performance. With regard to bookings, momentum has accelerated with 11.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our November earnings call. We continue to see an increase in multi-year module sale agreements, driven by our customers need for certainty in terms of the technology they\u2019re investing in and the suppliers\u2019 integrity and ethics. Representative of this, we have executed an agreement with our highly valued long-term partner SB Energy to supply 1.5 gigawatts of deployment in projects in 2023, 2024, and 2025. As we are accounting for shipments of approximately 2.1 gigawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments which extended into 2025 are 26.2 gigawatts, including our year-to-date bookings, they\u2019re sold out for 2022 and has 10.7 gigawatts, 3.4 gigawatts, and 2.4 gigawatts for planned deliveries in 2023, 2024, and 2025 respectively. Next, I would like to provide an update on our project development and O&M platform in Japan. Today, our remaining offerings outside of our core module business includes project development in Japan, O&M outside of North America, and our continued ownership of certain power generating assets. Of these remaining businesses, our Japan platform is the most prominent in terms of perspective, scale and profitability. In late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japan project development in O&M platform. We believe that potential purchase stretch strategy to scale a leading solar platform in Japan, coupled with the participation of complementary asset classes could unlock the full potential of our Japan platform. Accordingly, we are in advanced stage negotiations to sell our Japan project element and O&M platform. While there is no certainty that we will execute a definitive agreement with this counterparty, we believe that the contemplated transaction value is compelling, though, if we do not complete this transaction, we expect to either continue our approach of selling down our contracts or projects over time, or consider an alternative buyer for the platform.  And I\u2019ll turn the call over Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2020 results. Alex? Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. And before discussing our financials results for the quarter and full year 2021, I\u2019ll first provide an update on our segment reporting. With potential sale of our Japan product development and O&M platform, the revenue and margin opportunities outside of our core modules business lie largely with a relatively small pool of existing O&M contracts outside of Japan in North America, power generating assets for projects that we previously developed, and any legacy obligations as a result of our prior systems activities. Accordingly, we\u2019ve changed our reportable segments to align with our internal reporting structure and long-term strategic plan. Going forward, our module business will represent our only reportable segment but for comparative purposes, the prospective module segment is fully comparable to prior periods. Any revenue or margin associated with activities or historically calculated with our systems business are now presented as other in our segment.  Starting on Slide 5, I\u2019ll cover the income statement highlights the first quarter and full year 2021, which was presented in this manner. Net sales in the fourth quarter were 907 million, an increase to 324 million compared to the prior quarter. This was primarily a result of the sale of three projects in Japan and increased module volume sold in Q4. For the full year 2021, net sales were 2.9 billion compared to 2.7 billion in 2020. Relative to our guidance expectations, net sales were within but towards the lower end of our guidance range, due to delays in module sales, revenue recognition, as a result of the aforementioned freight and logistics challenges.  Gross margin was 27% in the fourth quarter versus 21% in the third quarter. For the full year 2021, gross margin was 25%, which is unchanged from the prior year. 2021 guidance assume the completion of two project sales in Japan. The results could be three project sales in Q4, our Q4 gross profit for our residual business operations was 102 million, approximately 25 million above the high end of our guidance range for Q4 and full year \u201821.  Module segment gross margin was 21% in the fourth quarter, which is unchanged from the prior quarter. For the full year 2021, our module segment gross profit came in below the low end of our guidance range by approximately 12 million. Additionally, fully 2021 module segment gross margin of 20% was down 5 percentage points from 25% in 2020. This was due to with several items. Firstly, sales freight continued to adversely impact financial results, reducing gross margin by 6 percentage points in 2020, 11 percentage points full year 2021, and 13 percentage points in Q4 of 2021. Note as a reminder, many of our module peers report freight costs as a separate operating expense. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider this factor when benchmarking our module gross margin percent relative to our peers.  Secondly, 2021 volumes fell below our full year expectations due to the aforementioned oceanfreight reliability issues, port congestion, and over the road trucking capacity constraints. The year end 2021 modules in transit number of 675 megawatts remains above historic norm. Thirdly, factory upgrades in 2021 resulted in higher downtime and under utilization and lower production. The full year 2021 ramp and underutilization related expenses of 19 million were 1 ne percentage point of gross margin. Finally, we reduced our cost to watt produced by 6% between the end of 2020 and 2021. We faced a cost of watt produced headwinds in 2021 as a result of higher inbound freight and other costs. In light of the circumstances, although the module segment gross profit and gross margin came in below 2021 expectation, we are pleased with how we navigated the current environment and delivered solid module segment performance.  SG&A, R&D and production staff expenses total 73 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately 1 million relative to the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by 1 million increase in production staff expense from the addition of our third factory in Ohio, a 4 million increase in R&D expense predominately related to CuRe testing, which will partially offset by payment charge related to a certain development project that occurred in the prior period. SG&A, R&D and production staff expenses totaled 290 million in 2021 versus 357 million in 2020. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with operating expense results of 290 million, which was within our full year guidance range of 285 million to 300 million, and represents a significant year-over-year reduction. Operating income was 173 million in Q4 and 597 million for the full year 2021. Income tax expense was 103 million for the full year 2021. Fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.23, compared to $0.42 in the prior quarter. For full year 2021, earnings per share was $4.38 compared to $3.73 in 2020. Our 2021 EPS result came in above the midpoint of the guidance range we provided on the third quarter earnings call, and is also within the original range we provided last February. Although several unexpected challenges and benefits we faced last year, our overall performance reflects the strength of our business model and ability to navigate a challenging environment over the course of the year.  So in the Slide 6, our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities balance at year end was 1.8 billion, a decrease of 109 million from the prior quarter. Our year end net cash position, which includes cash and cash equivalents restricted cash marketable securities, less debt, was 1.6 billion, a decrease of 71 million in prior quarter. Our net cash balance is higher than our guidance range due to lower than expected project spend on Japanese development projects and the timing of cash payments for capital expenditures that were delayed in 2022. Cash flows for operations was 238 million in 2021 versus 37 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were 195 million in the fourth quarter compared to 165 million in the third quarter and CapEx was 540 million in 2021 compared to 417 million in 2020.  With that, I will turn the call back to Mark to provide a business and strategy update. Mark Widmar : Thank you, Alex. Turning to slide seven, I would like to begin by providing an update on our CuRe program. Over five years ago, we announced the acceleration of our Series 6 transition, which transformed our manufacturing process and significantly increased our module wattage. While the outcome of the Series 6 program has been a great success, as reflected by our record 22 gigawatt backlog as of the end of 2021, it is easy to lose sight of the initial challenges we faced when scaling high volume manufacturing with respect to module wattage, throughput and manufacturing yield. Through persistence, resilience and ingenuity, our manufacturing associates methodically resolved these challenges, enabling Series 6 to be the success as is today.  Looking forward, CuRe represents an anticipated enhancement to our module performance, which is expected to increase efficiency and lifecycle energy. On the November earnings call, we indicated that we had demonstrated CuRe\u2019s for performance entitlements in a lab setting and are working to realize the entitlement in high volume manufacturing conditions. As a result, we have revised our integration schedule to lead line implementation by the end of Q1 2022 with fleet-wide replication timing to be determined upon completion of the lead line. Since the previous earnings call, we have conducted a series of CuRe runs on high volume production lines in Ohio. And while the trends are for improving module wattage and degradation appear favorable, we are still working to realize the full performance entitlement in high volume manufacturing conditions. Over the coming weeks, we intend to conduct further testing, which we believe will informed our views on lead line implementation timing. Again, this lead line implementation timing will in turn inform fleet-wide replication timing. As highlighted on our Q2 2021 earnings call, our technology team continues to create new optionality in our technology roadmap. This optionality enables us to partially mitigate the effects of CuRe delays through the enhancement of our current Series 6 technology with our top production bin reaching 465 watts at our Ohio and Malaysia factories. In addition to this improved efficiency and module wattage, Series 6 now has a significantly improved long-term degradation rate. Using the improvement metrology to measure degradation at our test sites, and further validated by third-party analytic methods and customer site data, the current Series 6 platform now has a 30-year warranted power output degradation rate of 0.3% per year, which is 40% below our previous warranted and represents a potential 4.4 increase in life cycle energy.  While the improved Series 6 nameplate wattage allows us to achieve our targeted exiting 2021, with a top production bin of 460 to 465 watts, the expected overall lifetime energy performance of the current Series 6 program remains under that of CuRe, primarily due to differences in warranted degradation rate and temperature coefficient. That said, looking into 2022, we believe there is a path for Series 6 module to increase the top production bin to 470 watts with an upside potential of 475 watts exiting the year. Furthermore, we are also working on our Series 6 modules, under the current program, to achieve a temperature coefficient similar to what is expected under our CuRe program. I\u2019ll discuss additional optionality in our technology roadmap, including bifaciality and opportunities to drive to higher levels of efficiency later in the call.  While CuRe implementation has been delayed, the significant improvements in efficiency and degradation of Series 6 has been beneficial to more closely meet our customers\u2019 expectations. In connection with our CuRe obligations this year, as discussed on our November earnings call, we have either mandate or in an advanced stage negotiation to amend certain customer contracts utilizing CuRe technology by substituting our enhanced Series 6 product. We expect these amendments to impact 2022 revenue and gross margin by approximately $60 million, which is reflected in our guidance. Note, we are still working to finalize certain CuRe-related contract amendments, relative to our contracted backlog disclosure, approximately 40% of the 60 million is in our contracted backlog disclosure as of December 31, 2021. The balance will be reflected once the remaining contract amendments are completed. These amendments coupled with the existing and forecasted improvements to our current Series 6 program related to efficiency, module wattage degradation rate, and temperature coefficient, as well as other potential enhancements under our technology roadmap, which I will discuss momentarily, have reduced the requirements to implement our CuRe program by a particular deadline. Looking into 2022, we are pleased to enter the year with a record backlog and a growth plan well underway with capacity expansions in the US and India. However, 2022 is expected to be a challenging year from an earnings standpoint, both due to external factors and the near-term impact of factory startup costs associated with our growth plans. The most significant driver impacting the year is the freight market. Ocean freight costs for contracted volumes have risen 200% to 300% from pre-pedantic levels. With our recently concluded carrier negotiations, we expect our 2022 contracted freight rates to increase by more than 100% year-over-year. This compares to a pre pandemic historic annual percentage increase in the mid-to-upper single digits. At the same time, transit times have significantly increased and reliability and availability have significantly worsened, pushing more volume into a higher price spot market. Despite record profitability across the shipping industry, this situation currently shows no sign of improving in 2022. We increasingly are monitoring the growing calls for accountability. In particular, from Georgia Senator Warnock, who has demanded an investigation into the apparent price gouging of ocean carriers.  We expect sales freight for 2022 to increase to approximately $0.05 a lot. This is a combination of contracting and premium rates. Year-on-year, we expect a better mix of contracts and premium rates but with the substantial increase in contract rates, we expect sales freight costs to increase by approximately $200 million to $240 million year-on-year. Note, our anticipated 2022 shipments were largely booked prior to the shocking increase in freight rates. Relative to our expectations at the time of the negotiation, the module ASP freight rates have more than doubled.  Externally, there have been a number of events that have adversely impacted our module cost reduction roadmap. Firstly, the aforementioned freight market disruption has resulted in higher shipment costs for inbound raw materials. Secondly, the increase in inflation and commodities has both directly and indirectly affected our bill of materials and costs of production. The cost of aluminum, which has increased over 40% between the start and end of 2021, has been a strong headwind against our module costs. We have partially offset this headwind by implementing our Series 6 Plus at our Malaysia and US factories, which reduced the aluminum content of our frames by 10%. Thirdly, COVID-19 constraints including travel quarantine restrictions for both First Solar associates and third-party equipment installers have impacted the timing of our Series 6 Plus and throughput upgrades in Vietnam. While we are expecting to see a loosening of travel restrictions this year, this uncertainty present ongoing risks to the timing of upgrades at our labs factory in Vietnam to Series 6 Plus, which is expected to be completed in early Q2. COVID-related constraints has also delayed the fleet rollout of our glass optimization program.  As mentioned previously, our 2021 cost per watt declined by 6% versus our target of 11%. The shortfall reflective of the items noted above resulted in us missing our cost per watt target reduction by approximately $0.01 per watt. While we expect to continue to improve our cost per watt in 2022, we will not be able to offset a number of the headwinds experienced in 2021. And therefore, our module costs will be higher than our roadmap by approximately $0.01 per watt. This expected to negatively impact 2022 gross margin by approximately $100 million.  While, there are better sources for expert perspectives on the most recent activities in Ukraine and Russia, and the resulting invocation on geopolitics, from our perspective, we are watching closely the tragic events unfold. As of today, our supply chain has not been impacted by the crisis and we have no current tier one suppliers in the conflict area. It is reasonable to anticipate natural volatility and various supply markets such as metals or fuel, should the conflict continue to escalate. We will continue to monitor this situation daily. Internally, the current limitation delays and the expected module wattage improvements will adversely impact our expected cost per watt reductions. And finally, capacity growth decisions made in 2021 will provide long-term benefits in 2023 and beyond, but provide a headwind to the 2022 P&L starts due to startup expenses of $85 million to $90 million. We will continue to navigate these headwinds with a focus on the future. As we invest in realizing the full value of our differentiated thin film technology, this pivotal year will evolve around continuing significant investments in R&D, new products, manufacturing expansion, and employing new contracting strategies, all of which we believe will set the stage for sustained growth in 2023a And beyond. As relates to R&D, our team has been cultivating optionality and our roadmap across energy attributes, including efficiency, degradation, temperature coefficient, and bifaciality, along with product attributes, including Series 7. More specifically, on the Q2 2021 earnings call, we highlighted that we are deploying prototypes of early stage bifacial cad-tel modules at our test facility and we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. Since then, we have continued to run performance tests on both our current and CuRe device platforms, and has gathered more field data, with the results implying the potential for an increase in specific energy. Adding bifaciality on cad-tel adds to the well-understood and valued temperature coefficient, spectral response, and partial shading and long-term degradation energy advantages. With a mid-term target of a 490 watt bifacial module, we\u2019re working diligently to commercialize this technology across our future platforms. We believe the commercial and financial perspective, prospects of bifacial cad-tel are compelling due to the anticipated higher energy yield with limited CapEx or retooling required in order to integrate a transparent back contact across the fleet. Turning to Slide 8, as it relates to expansion, construction of our Series 7 factories is underway and the schedules are on track, with the US factory expected to commence initial production in the first half of 2023 and the India factory by the end of 2023. Once scaled, these factories are expected to lead the fleet in terms of module wattage, efficiency and cost per watt. With a mid-term goal of 570 watt by monofacial Series 7 module, we see the potential for meaningful improvement in our module performance. As we significantly increase our nameplate capacity, we believe this anticipated growth when balanced with liquidity and profitability will drive contribution margin expansion, given our operating expense cost structure is 80% to 90% fixed. As a reflection of this expansion roadmap and continued optimization of the existing Series 6 fleet, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2022, 2023, and 2024 on Slide 9. As it relates to our contracting strategy, a feature of our newer framework agreements is the customers entering into a contract today can benefit from the potential realization of our technology roadmap. For approximately 7.3 gigawatts of bookings secured prior to the end of the calendar year, we\u2019ve structured the ASP and product expectations on a baseline wattage and energy performance roadmap without the full anticipated benefits of our technology roadmap. To the extent, we realized future module technology improvements including new product design and energy enhancements beyond what is specified in the baseline agreement, the incremental value is expected to result in a corresponding increase ASP. Our ability to contract in this manner provides our customers with clarity of pricing, product availability and delivery timing enabling them to underwrite PPAs from position of strength, with lower risk to the expected project returns. From our perspective, there is also strategic rationale to contract in this manner, as it provides us confidence in our ability to sell through our expected supply and provides visibility into an expected profit per watt with the potential for meaningful upside to the extent we realize these anticipated technology improvements. This framework allows us to understand the price certainty, the value of our investments across different product enhancements. Based on these potential technology improvements, there\u2019re approximately 7.3 gigawatts of contracted module volumes as of December 31, 2021, such adjustments if realized could result in additional revenue of up to 22 billion, majority of which would be recognized in 2023. Note this contracting approach has been incorporated in our 2022 bookings year-to-date. From a sales freight contracting perspective, last year, we began employing module contract structures, which mitigate our exposure to sales freight. As we continue to look in two to four years into the future, these arrangements provide a balanced risk profile for us and our customers, where we are incentivized to minimize sales freight costs that generally provide a cap above which customers are obligated to pay. We started employing these structures in Q2 2021 and approximately one-third of our expected 2022 volume includes the provisions. In 2023 and beyond, we anticipate a significant majority of volume will include these types of provisions. Across our contracted backlog, these contracts provide greater clarity into an expected gross profit per watt, thus providing freight relief through a hiring ASP, if rates remain above pre-pandemic levels.  In addition to our contracting approach, our expansion strategy, including our third Ohio plants and our new India plant are expected to further de-risk our exposure to transoceanic freight costs by bringing manufacturing closer to demand. At the factory scale, our production mix exposed to transoceanic freight risk is expected to decrease by approximately 30 percentage points between 2022 and 2024. Overall, from a pricing perspective, the strong demand we are witnessing for our differentiated cad-tel module has enabled us to secure 10.7 gigawatts of bookings for planned deliveries in 2023, at a baseline ASP that is only $0.003 below our planned deliveries in 2022.  It is important to note that ASP is essentially composed of two components, the module plus sale freight. The baseline ASP generally assumes sales freight will be approximately $0.025 per watt. To the extent that the actual sales freight is above the baseline, the ASP will increase to cover most of, if not all of, the incremental sales freight. When including this variable pricing adjustment, and assuming 2022 sales freight environment, we expect our 2023 sales freight adjusted ASP to be approximately $0.01 higher than 2022 on a like basis. In addition, as we secure the significant volume for delivery in 2023, we have been employing a contracting strategy which enables our customers to benefit from the evolution of our technology and product platform. Realizing the entirety of the benefit of this platform will increase our baseline \u201823 ASP by up to $0.02 cents a lot.  Turning to Slide 10, we continue to see active customer engagement and high levels of interest in both individual projects, as well as a multi-year and multi-gigawatt agreements across key markets in the United States and India. Our total bookings opportunities of 53.6 gigawatts remain very robust, with 27.7 gigawatts in the mid to late stage customer engagement. This opportunity set coupled with our contracted backlog gives us confident as we continue scaling our manufacturing capacity. Incrementally we continue to evaluate the potential for future capacity expansion. As referenced on the Q3 earnings call, we have started to engage with certain suppliers to ensure we have line of sight on critical path tools for further expansion. We believe strong demand for our cad-tel modules, a dynamic technology roadmap, a strong balance sheet, and largely fixed operating expense cost structure are each catalyst, as we evaluate expansion. While this potential expansion may be in the US, India or beyond, we are seeking clarity on domestic solar policies to ensure such expansion is well positioned. Note, we have made no such decision at this time and any capacity expansions are unlikely to contribute to our 2023 production plan. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Alex who will discuss the financial outlook and provide 2022 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks Mark. Before discussing \u201822 financial guidance, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our cost roadmap. As initially presented our February 2021 guidance call, we forecasted the year end 2020 to year end 2021 cost watt produce reduction of 11%. In November, we revised our reduction assumption to 5% based on increased inbound freight could last [phonetic] aluminum and adhesive costs a final year-over-year reduction in payment of 6% to 7%. So, of note, the 5% difference between our original assumption and our year end result remains a headwind in 2022 and is expected to impact full year 2022 cost per watt by approximately a $0.01. On a cost per watt sold basis, our original year-over-year forecast reduction of 8% was revised to 3% in November, and our final full year result cost per watt sold remained flat year-over-year. This is despite a year-over-year increase in sales freight per watt of 70%. Excluding the effect of the sales rate, our cost of watts sold declined by approximately 8% for the same period.  Looking at 2022, from a glass perspective, we\u2019ve largely stabilized this cost through long-term predominantly fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have economic benefits, as we achieve high levels of production. On the Q3 2021 earnings call, we highlighted COVID-related delays impact the startup timing of new glass facilities to support our Malaysia and Vietnam sites. In addition to competitive pricing, the facility is expected to reduce the cost of inbound freight for our international sites. Given recent improvement in the COVID situation in Southeast Asia, we anticipate this new facility will commence production and begin benefiting cost per watt in the first half of this year.  The race to aluminum, we anticipate framing costs will be elevated relative to historical norms. We highlighted during our Q3 earnings call that we had a commodity swap contract in place, which covered the majority of our US consumption in 2021. Note, many of our aluminum contracts with supplier Malaysia and Vietnam factories reference aluminum trade on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, which makes hedging a challenge, given foreign investors cannot access the market without a registered local entity in China. While aluminum pricing remains above pre-pandemic levels, going forward, and for both domestic and international sites, there are several strategies and process to reduce framing cost in the near term. Firstly, by differentiating the frame design and reducing costs for modules installed in certain geographies and parts of the array are exposed to standard versus high mechanical loads; secondary, by optimizing the mounting interface for our Series 7 module; and finally, by evaluating alternative materials for the construction of our frame, including a steel back rail for our Series 7 modules in India.  As it relates to logistics, outbound sale trade is expected to be approximately $0.05 per watt in 2022. In context prior to recent dislocation the Global Freight market, sales freight per watt was generally between $0.02 and $0.025 per watt in 2020. Note, the aforementioned sales freight contract provisions are expected to provide approximately half a penny [indiscernible] on a fleet wide basis in 2022, which is reflected in our guide. On a fleet-wide basis, relative to where we acted in 2021, we anticipate reducing our costs per watt produced by 4% to 6% by the end of 2022. Despite an expected 25% to 40% increase in sales freight per watt, we anticipate our cost per watt sold will be flat between the end of 2021 and 2022, respectively. Excluding the effect of sales freight, we anticipate our cost per watt sold decline by approximately 5% to 8% over the same period. Note, the expected 25% to 40% increase in sales per watt in 2022 is expected to partially offset by contract provisions for sales rate recovery, which cover approximately one-third of our shipments in the year. By 2023, similar sales rate recovery provisions are expected to cover a significant majority of our shipment.  Turning to slide 11, looking forward, despite near term inflationary pressure around certain commodity and logistics costs, we believe our revised midterm roadmap will enable us to continue reducing our Series 6 costs per watt. Starting with efficiency, our midterm goal is a 490 watt bifacial and 500 watt monofacial model. As a reminder, improvements in module watts is generally provided benefits each component of cost per watt including our variable, fixed and sales freight costs. Secondly, we\u2019re tracking to increase throughput by 9% to 11% in the mid-term on our existing manufacturing base, resulting in a fixed cost solution benefit. Thirdly, we continue to see a positive increase in our Series 6 manufacturing yield to 98.5% in the midterm. Fourth, we see opportunities to reduce our bill of material costs by 10% midterm, primarily across framing and glass. And finally, we believe culmination of fitting our module profile, transport optimization, and employing risk sharing mechanisms in our customer contracting, could lead to a 40% to 50% reduction in net sales freight cost. Note, this expected reduction includes a combination of cost recaptured through the aforementioned sales rate customer contracting strategy, and increased modules to shipping container.  Separately, as it relates to Series 7, we anticipate both India and Ohio factories to have cost per watt once fully ramped lower than our current lowest cost factories in Vietnam. Combined with the benefit of locating supply near to demand and reducing the cost of sales freight, Series 7 is expected to reduce cost per watt and net sales freight costs in total by approximately $0.01 to $0.02 cents relative to Series 6.  With that context in mind, I\u2019ll discuss the assumptions included in our 2022 financial guidance. Turn to Slide 12. Starting with legacy systems items, we are pleased with the potential value and long-term benefits of selling planned development and O&M platform. While there\u2019ll be no assurance that we will enter into an agreement for a transaction, our guidance assumes a gain of approximately 270 million to 290 million, which would be recognized as a gain on sale of businesses, which lies between gross margin and operating income on the P&L. As we previously assumed ongoing asset sales from the development portfolio, which benefit gross margin, this change in assumption is a headwind to gross margin in 2022. Furthermore, until any sale is closed, overhead costs associated with this planned platform will also continue on impacting operating expenses.  In addition, we signed an agreement to sell remaining international O&M contracts outside Japan, up on closing which is expected in the first half of 2020, we expect to recognize a pre-tax gain on sales shown in the income statement between gross margin and operating income of approximately 10 million. As it relates to power generating assets, we\u2019re evaluating whether to continue holding or lose on multi-asset in Chile, whether it\u2019s a series sales this project. Considering such a sale would require coordination with the project lenders, as previously discussing on November earnings call, could result in impairment charge in the future, if we are unable to recover our net carrying value in the project. No impact from any profitable sales of this project is included in our guidance for 2022.  2022 shipments are expected to be between 8.9 and 9.4 gigawatts, which exceeds our production plan for the year of 8.2 to 8.8 gigawatts due to higher than expected inventory levels in year-end 2021. Our factory expansion and factory upgrade roadmaps are expected to impact operating income by approximately 95 million to 105 million. This comprises the startup expenses of 85 million to 90 million, primarily incurred by our new factories in Ohio and India. As previously mentioned, we\u2019re planning to implement Series 6 class upgrades in Vietnam and other upgrades in 2022. These upgrades require downtime resulting in estimated underutilization losses of 10 million to 15 million. We anticipate these improvements will contribute meaningfully by 2023 production plan.  Our liquidity position has been a strategic differentiator in an industry that\u2019s historically prioritized growth without regard to long-term capital structure. For example, we\u2019re one of the few solar companies that both entered and exited the last decade and our strong balance sheets enabled us to weather periods of volatility and also to pursue growth opportunities. Additionally, we were able to self fund our Series 6 transition whilst maintaining our strong liquidity position ending 2021 with 1.6 billion of net cash. Based on our existing liquidity position, coupled with expecting operating cash flows from existing Series 6 factories, we believe we can self finance our expansion roadmap. However, based on the opportunity to secure a competitive term and strategic benefits of a partner, when entering to new market, we may raise that financing for the construction of our new factory in India.  I will cover 2022 guidance ranges on slide 13. Our net sales guidance is between 2.4 billion and 2.6 billion, which is predominantly module segment revenue. Gross margins expected to be between 155 million and 215 million, which includes 155 million to 225 million of module segment gross margin and negative 10 million impacts from other legacy activities. Module segment gross margin includes underutilization losses of 10 million to 15 million. As discussed, we anticipate sale freight will be a significant headwind in 2022 and we anticipate sales freight will reduce our module segment gross margin by 18 to 20 percentage points for the full year of 2020. SG&A expense is expected to total 170 million to 175 million, compared to 170 million in \u201821 and 223 million in 2020. As indicated on the guidance call last February, we anticipated the sale of our US product development business to results in annualized savings of approximately 45 million to 50 million of which approximately 60% sits in the operating expense line. We\u2019ve tracked well relative to this cost reduction plan and pleased with expect the savings on a go-forward basis. R&D expense is expected to total 110 million to 115 million versus 99 million and 94 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As we continue to grow our manufacturing capacity, we also intend to add additional headcount to our R&D team to further invest Advanced Research Initiative. SG&A and R&D expenses combined totaled 280 million to 290 million and total operating expenses, included 85 million to 90 million production staff expense, are expected to be between 365 million and 380 million. Operating income is expected to be between 55 million and 150 million, inclusive of an expected approximately 280 million to 300 million gain on sale related to the aforementioned Japan project development and international O&M transactions and 95 million to 105 million of combined under utilization costs and planned startup expenses.  So the non-operating items effects interest income, interest expense and other income to net negative 20 million to 30 million, which is predominant driven by FX and interest expense related to Japanese project. Full year tax expense is forecast to be 35 million to 55 million. This results in full year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range zero to $0.60. And note from an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate our earnings profile will improve gradually over the course of the year with a significant impact in the quarter, in which any sales of a pan-developed platform were to close.  Capital expenditures in 2022 is expected to range from 850 million to 1.1 billion as we advance the construction of our Ohio and India plant and upgrades to the fleet and invest in other R&D related programs. Our year end 2022 net cash balance is anticipated to be between 1.1 and 1.35 billion. The decrease from our 2021 year end net cash balance is primarily due to capital expenditures associated with the building of our Ohio and India manufacturing plants, which we expect will be partially offset by financing proceeds.  Turning to slide 14, I\u2019ll summarize the key message from today\u2019s call. Demand has been robust, with 11.8 gigawatts net bookings from previous earnings call. Our opportunity pipeline continues to grow with a global opportunity set at 53.6 gigawatts including mid to late stage opportunities of 27.7 gigawatts. On the supply side, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to exit 2024 with approximately 16 gigawatts of capacity. We see significant mid-term opportunity for improvements in our modular efficiency cost and energy metrics. We ended 2021 was full year EPS with $4.38 cents and are forecasting full year 2022 earnings per share of $0 to $0.60.  With that we complete our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on pricing. As you think through your pricing for \u201822 and \u201823 with the backdrop of the contracting strategy and the recent bookings, do you think the blended pricing in \u201822 could be possibly $0.30 or higher or do you expect both \u201822 and \u201823 to be in the high $0.20 per watt? And also was wondering if you could speak to what the expected margins might be for \u201823, especially as you drive some cost down in \u201823, maybe some of the headwinds abates a touch and then your pricing can stay relatively flattish? And then finally talked about new products in your OpEx investment, through some of your work, it seems like you might be exploring some eg and resi solar opportunities, so I was wondering if you might be able to talk through whether or not you see some concrete opportunities there? Could that be a new product for you as you roll out the new plant in Ohio? And if so, what kind of volume could that be? It is a nice market with healthy ASPs, so any color there would be very helpful. Thanks. Mark Widmar : Alright, so, Phil, I guess, on the pricing, there\u2019s a little bit of potential pricing upside in 2022, but not overly significant to the extent that the sales, there are about 30% of the volume we have in 2022, has some sales rate adjustments, which will appropriately take -- comply with the obligations under the contract and, therefore, adjust if the cost is above the capital, which we agree to, so that could impact it. If we are able to, for example, improve the temp coefficient on our current product, then there\u2019s potentially some opportunity that can be monetized in 2022 but there\u2019s not a significant increase in ASP opportunities off of what you see. And I think the contracted backlog that will show up in the K is going to be somewhere right around I think $0.27 or something like that. And that relates to the 22 gigawatts or so that we do have contracted.  As you go into 2023, I will take that, look, I what I said in the call is that, essentially, the ASPs are relatively flat; I think we\u2019re down about three tenths of a cent or something like that in \u201823 relative to \u201822. But there\u2019s about $0.03 of adjustment, there\u2019s a penny or a little bit north of a penny on the sales rate, I want to make sure that\u2019s understood. Again, our pricing includes not only the module but the delivery of the module, so if you think about what our pricing or net pricing is today, at least for the module, you take cost $0.27 or so which is in the K at the average, and you pull $0.05 out of that. So that effectively says that our net module pricing is about $0.22.  If you do that same analysis for the revised contracting structure that we have, you would take the $0.27 and back off about $0.025, so you\u2019re going to see an increase of ASP just from that structure. There\u2019s a potential of $0.025 of higher ASP monetization in 2023, than we have in 2022 because of how we structured the contract. Now, only about 70 or so percent of the contracts in 2023 have that structure, all of the bookings that we\u2019ve done, that whole 12 gigawatts that we just referenced, as an example, have a modification formula actively embedded in that or a customer may accept export type of pricing, therefore, we don\u2019t take the freight risk, and they\u2019re responsible for it as an example. So, there\u2019s opportunities, if you take the $0.27 and if you include the sales freight, and if you include the price adjusters for the technology, which could be by [indiscernible] could be higher bid and so on, that you could see significant increases in \u201823 over \u201822.  You can do the math, you can sort of make your own assumptions, does it get into the 30s or not, there\u2019s the potential to start pushing upwards of that. But again, depending on how we structured the risk profile on the sales freight, you can see individual opportunities that will have three handles on them for various reasons and how we structure and how we contract it. As it relates to expected margin, I can\u2019t give you the absolute numbers on that but what I can say is that, there\u2019s upward opportunity in ASPs based on what I referenced. Alex indicated that will continue, we just took 6% of cost per watt down in 2021 over 2020 and then there\u2019s other you single digit types of opportunity of reducing \u201822 over \u201821. So if you just do your math, carry it forward, you can see that there is still a trajectory. Even in the environment that we\u2019re dealing with right now that is very challenging, there\u2019s a trajectory that can still drive to a lower cost per watt. So you can do the margin around in terms of what is the expected margin is by doing the math and how we\u2019ve described it during the call on ASP as well as the cost side.  On the comment about Digi that we\u2019ve been saying for a while now that we are looking at tandem structures and high efficiency modules that drive an opportunity to expand there are traditionally utility scale segment of the market which we currently serve. As we think through that roadmap and that product evolution, then clearly it does open a Digi [indiscernible] type of opportunity that could enable an entitlement of higher ASPs. But Phil, as you know, I mean, we are on a path to get 16 gigawatts. I mean, if we\u2019re dealing, let\u2019s say, 500 megawatts, maybe even a gigawatt, yes, it\u2019s a great market, we want to participate, we\u2019ve got some great services, we\u2019ve had some conversations in that regard, but still going to be, relatively small percentage of the overall business. Alex Bradley : So just one thing to add on the \u201822 to \u201823 on top of the ASP and cost indication that Mark gave is that when you get into \u201823, we\u2019re going to have call it one or two gigawatts of Series 7 come on line. As we indicated that Series 7 has an ASP entitlements, as you can assume, already reflected in the backlog in some cases, but in some cases, it may not be and maybe some upside from that. It also has a $0.01 to $0.02 cost advantage based on [indiscernible] sales freight. So you are going to get the benefit of that coming through as well in 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Osha with Guggenheim Partners. Joseph Osha : Hello, gentlemen, congratulations on continuing to represent American solar manufacturing so well. Two questions for you. First, I\u2019m wondering, given the relatively recent shift in policy, we\u2019ve seen the vis-\u00e0-vis 201 in the bifacial exemptions. Have you seen that manifest in terms of pricing conversation for your more recent bookings? And then secondly, Mark, I \u2013 perhaps you could clarify, obviously, you\u2019re sort of pushing forward with Ohio, but I think I heard some comments in the vis-\u00e0-vis in 2023 and some maybe fluidity to the plans there, depending on policy. If so, if you could clarify that, that would be great. Mark Widmar : Yeah. On the other policy, just in general, around 201 and clearly, we were disappointed with the bifacial exemption that was provided. The reality is, for me, the way I look at this, the model has many different attributes but every module basically takes photons and electrons. And how you choose to do that, we talk about our attributes a lot, we talk about our spectral response and our ability to be damaged as relates to moisture in the air and humidity. We talk about our temperature coefficient, we talk about our shading response as an example. Those are all attributes, which take advantage of your technology beyond just the labeled watts and turning photons into electrons and bifaciality is nothing more than that. It is just another attribute that allows for additional energy generated from a module that takes photons and makes electrons. So there to me is no common sense rational reason why bifacial modules would be exempt. It\u2019d be no different than if somebody to any attribute, it could be long-term degradation, our long-term degradation where you could say that, if you have a long-term degradation rate that\u2019s below x, then you\u2019d be exempt from the 201 duties, which, to me wouldn\u2019t make any sense, nor does the bifacial exemption in itself make any sense.  As it relates to our customers, our customers, they value that the relationship with First Solar. They value our willingness to deliver and to honor our contracts and to stand by them in times they were challenged in right now. And that\u2019s why we refer to our customers as partners, and we partner in times of when things are going well and when things are more are more challenging, right. We\u2019re going to work together and we\u2019ll find solutions that we can enable each other success. As we look to this is, again, a marathon, a long-term journey, of which we\u2019re different front end as a world of electrification. And all that world of electrification starts by turning photons into electrons and we\u2019ll do that better than anyone else and so our partners want to work with us.  And so yes, there\u2019s some policy angst, ebbs and flows, but nobody can look around the corner and say for certain that any of our competitors, again, vastly Chinese competitors will be able to stand by our partners through their journey, and the uncertainty of things that could happen. So it does play to our strengths. Just look at our -- we just booked 12 gigawatts. We have a mid-to late-stage pipeline of 27 gigawatts. After those 12 gigawatts were booked, we got to -- including early stage, we got 55 gigawatts, both of those pipeline metrics are up about 10 gigawatts from what we talked about during the last earnings call, and we just booked 12 gigawatts. So there\u2019s lots of opportunities. I think our value proposition, our uniqueness, our technology, our growth plan, our expansion, being America\u2019s solar company along the lines, Joe, what you\u2019ve referenced means a lot in the market that we\u2019re in right now. So I think it plays to our strengths.  As relates to growth, what I meant to, we talked before about growth, we\u2019ve got capacity expansion for two new factories, one here in Ohio and another in India. We mentioned that we are working to evaluate further expansion, and if this pipeline -- our backlog of bookings, and then pipeline of opportunities continues to grow, we get to a point where we\u2019re going to need to start evaluating expansion beyond what we\u2019ve already committed to, and is there another factory of 3 gigawatts or is there another two factories that could be 6 gigawatts to be determined, but it\u2019s all driven often by fundamentals of demand in the marketplace, our relative position, and our ability to sell forward. So we\u2019ll keep you updated. All we\u2019re trying to do is to let people know that, hey, we\u2019re working through that and we\u2019re working very closely with our tool suppliers to enable that opportunity, if it were to come about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : Hi. Thank you. First, just some clarifications on the 2022 guidance and appreciate the detail you\u2019ve given. Much of the Japan and O&M [phonetic] business operations contribute to earnings for the year separate from the gain you\u2019ve noted and I just want to confirm the year-end cash balance includes the planned sales. Alex Bradley : Yeah, so there\u2019s very limited assumed contribution from the O&M business and the Japan business, the assumption is we wouldn\u2019t sell any assets this year, all of that will be reflected in the sale of the business and come through in the gain on sale. So you\u2019re seeing that full number be 270 to 290 and there\u2019s about an additional 10 million value associated with the sale of the O&M business. We\u2019re seeing limited addition of ongoing revenue and earnings. For the time that we keep that business we view that begin -- that gets all lumped in to gain on the sale. From a cash perspective, yes, the assumption is the value and the cash from that sale is in the cash number a year end. Operator : Perfect, thank you. And our next question is from J.B. Lowe with Citi. J.B. Lowe: Hi, Mark and Alex. Question was, Mark, you mentioned previously about your 2023 ASPs being down about 0.003, but on a net basis from freight, it would be up about $0.01. I\u2019m just wondering if you could just walk through the puts and takes of that piece. And then my other question was just on, given what we have seen so far out of Europe, in terms of responses to the ongoing crisis over there, have you -- I know it is only few days or the like, have you guys been engaging with customers in Europe potentially? I mean this goes kind of to the expansion question. But even ahead of that, have you been engaging any further with customers in, I guess, new or unexpected places, since this all started? Thanks. Mark Widmar : So on the ASP, the way we look at it, again, there\u2019s about 30% of our contracts in 2022 that have some freight adjuster. Again, just to put it back in perspective, to look at where we were a year ago, in Q1 of 2021, sales freight we reported in our number was about $0.025. So we\u2019ve gone from $0.025 in Q1 of last year to $0.05 a lot. So we didn\u2019t really -- and we generally have assumed historically around $0.02 that\u2019s kind of what our implied assumption is, that\u2019s what it\u2019s been historically and as we continue to drive lots up, it dilutes the average freight balance, it improved [indiscernible] a lot and everything else. So we saw this dramatic shift starts to happen in kind of Q2 of 2021, so we started modifying our contracts such that we weren\u2019t carrying that entire freight risk. And so there\u2019re adjusters, now not all of the benefits that just flow into \u201822, they flow -- they start to flow into a much higher percentage, about 70% or so. At \u201823, we\u2019ll have freight adjuster and really everything forward from \u201823 will have some form of freight adjuster associated with them.  So when you think about it, you got $0.05 as a headwind in this year\u2019s results that you\u2019re going to recover some nominal amount back from the customer and so you will see some adjustments to ASP as we progress throughout the year, maybe it ends up being about a penny and a half, somewhere -- or excuse me about a half a penny. So you\u2019re going to see our ASP will trend up from what\u2019s in our backlog right now as these sales rate adjusters are reflected for 2022 shipments. But we do that same math and looking how we structured our freight right, there\u2019s about a penny and a half that will come through in 2023. So the year-on-year, when you look at apples-to-apples, the ASPs, because of that recovery on the sales rate, it is going to go up about a penny. So you\u2019re -- thinking about your 27 this year is probably going to deploy you closer to 27.5, and then you got about a penny of that upside for that ASP going into 2023. Now, this all assumes that sales rates stays at $0.05, if it goes up to $0.06, well, then that adjuster is going to be higher, because I\u2019m still only really caring about $0.025 of the total sales rate risk my customer is going to pay me and accompany me for anything above and beyond that.  And then the other piece that will be accretive to ASP as we go into 2023 is we refer to them as these technology or platform adjusters, right. So we\u2019ve contracted with customers, just to look at a baseline product, the baseline product, basically, is what we\u2019re producing today, call it a 465 [phonetic] standard CuRe product. But we do anything about that, the bins get better. If the [indiscernible] gets better, the LTR gets better, it becomes bifacial, whatever it may be Series 7 will have a premium on it and that starts flowing into 2023, as well. So, all those become incremental to the ASP. And because -- while they\u2019re structured contractually that way, we don\u2019t have certainty out of the exact product that will be delivered, we can\u2019t reflect it into our contracted backlog. Those will be realized over time and then you\u2019ll see those benefits improve in contracted backlog. That\u2019s the point we\u2019re trying to make. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ben Kallo with Baird. Ben Kallo : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Has any of this the freight costs doubling, has that changed any of your thoughts around doing long-term contracts, as you look out into \u201824? And can you talk to us about how you\u2019re selling products from India? Is it more localized when you get out that far? And then my third question and final question is just can you talk to us about going to bifacial and how you make that decision and what it means on both ASP and a cost perspective? Thank you. Mark Widmar : Yeah, so let -- one thing before, Ben, as we get to your question I want to go back to the last question asked about Europe and were we seeing anything about Europe. There\u2019s been an \u2013 and I left to answer, I just answered the ASP. As it relates to Europe, there\u2019s been -- we\u2019ve had ongoing discussions with Europe and Europe is evolving in their journey similar to what we saw in India, as well as what we\u2019re seeing here in the US around creating domestic capabilities around manufacturing. So we are engaged, we have some -- we\u2019ve had conversations in Europe around manufacturing there. So it\u2019s one of the opportunities that we are evaluating along with the US and India, for example, for any further expansion, we got to cover that one.  So then on our freight costs, again, what we\u2019re doing, just think of it, I\u2019m telling the customer that our base price is X, and we\u2019ll take $0.025. So as we go into volumes and go on into \u201824 and \u201825, any volatility to that number really results in a variable ASP, so that it stays at $0.05 cents, as I go out into 2024 and 2025, there\u2019ll be an incremental ASP such that our customer will actually then covered that incremental sales rate cost, so largely ours is fixed at $0.025. We think that\u2019s a manageable position to take as we contract forward and our partners see it the same way that there should be some element of risk sharing, and given the uncertainty of what\u2019s going on in the market, and who knows how long it will continue. So I do think that we\u2019ve come to a reasonable balance approach around how we\u2019re thinking about sales freight and how we\u2019re contracting as we go forward. India pipeline, there\u2019s a lot going on, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity. India, it doesn\u2019t generally book out in as far as of horizon, you\u2019re normally going to see them maybe booking to secure modules about a year out terms of when the expected deliveries are needed. We\u2019re still looking second half of \u201823, so we\u2019re more than a year out to when the factory will be up and running and we\u2019re being a little careful with loading the front end production with selling out volume through at this point, just because it could be potential delays, unanticipated events could happen that could delay the project or the construction schedule or the tool installed, that we don\u2019t want to comment to volume with our customer. So we\u2019re leaving the front end and say the first quarter is kind of open right now until we have a higher level of certainty, we\u2019re further along in the construction as well as the install of the tools to commit to volumes with our customers. But it\u2019s not for lack of interest in demand, we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities in the pipeline, and I think you\u2019re going to see multiple gigawatts of bookings before the end of the year for India. Bifacial, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s an energy gain, right. If you look at it, it should get -- let\u2019s say, our bifaciality is going to be a little bit lower than where crystalline silicon is right now but we\u2019re still going to give probably in the range of 1% to 2% of energy and energy, depending on what markets sharing is worth, say three quarters of a penny to about a penny and a half. So you\u2019ve got an ASP opportunity premium for bifaciality and you call it in the range of, if you get 2%, it\u2019s going to be a penny and a half; if you get $0.015 for 1% of energy, it\u2019s going to be close to $0.03. So, you are somewhere between a penny and a half and, and $0.03 on ASP. No different than critical silicon, there\u2019ll be some trade-offs, some of the balance system costs because of [indiscernible] and other things that you may need to do that to capture the full benefit of the bifaciality, there may be some incremental BLS costs which will actually then pull from that ASP entitlement. But as we currently see it right now, it would be accretive, it\u2019ll drive higher ASP and it\u2019s another value of energy and we sell energy. It\u2019s not labeled loss, it is the actual energy profile that comes out of the module. Operator : Thank you, presenters. That\u2019s all the time that we have for today. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to First Solar\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mitch Ennis from First Solar Investor Relations. Mitch, you may begin. Mitch Ennis : Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar\u2019s website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter. Following the remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations including, among other risks and uncertainties, the severity and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today\u2019s press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Mitch. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. To begin, while our $0.41 loss per share results came in within our internal expectation for the quarter. It is reflective of what is projected to be a challenging 2022 from an earning standpoint. Due to the factors that we highlighted during our call in March, in which we\u2019ll address further today. That said, we are encouraged by our strong bookings progress. As we booked 11.9 gigawatt in less than 60 days since the prior earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings totaled 16.7 gigawatts. Further setting ourselves up for 2023 and beyond, an important feature of many of these recent bookings as previously discussed is that they include adjusters to potentially increase ASPs based on the realization of our technology roadmap, achievements, and sales risk sharing mitigation. In addition, we have begun to employ a similar ASP adjustment mechanism related to aluminum exposure. Later in the call, we will provide an indicative view of how these pricing adjustments could result in an ASP potentially significantly greater than the baseline reflected at the time of our bookings. In short, while these contracts have a baseline ASP that is reflective of the value of the product, we are manufacturing today. That ASP has the potential to increase, to capture the value of our product or technology enhancements or to offset sales rate and aluminum margin erosion risk. We believe this agile approach to contracting will continue to attract customers looking for long-term certainty and value. The combination of reliable competitive pricing and supply certainty, lower political and compliance risks and access to our best available technology is a tremendous value driver for sophisticated customers who may be fatigued with a volatility uncertainty. That can be experienced transacting in this industry, particularly in the current environment. It is worth noting that many of these recent bookings are with long-term repeat customers with relationships that span hundreds of megawatts of previously installed capacity. In addition, our most recent bookings include significant volume from customers new to First Solar. These decisions to work with First Solar and our technology speaks volumes, not just about the trust in the company, the value of our differentiated CadTel semiconductor and our adherence to principles of responsible solar, but also the risk of pursuing a solar at any cost strategy. By which we mean an approach that would otherwise compromise values and ambitions for projects powered by truly low carbon and environmentally superior solar. This trust is in part built upon the company\u2019s dependability and its ethos of honoring its commitments. Some argue that the current volatility in the industry in general and the module availability in pricing specifically, at this particular moment in time provides the company with an opportunity to pursue repricing of legacy contracts. Contracts that we are delivering on today, but which we\u2019re entered into in price several years ago. We take a different view. We are continuing to build First Solar for the long-term and our partnerships with our highly valued customers is critical aspect of that ambition. We believe the benefits that come with continuing to serve a base of enduring strategic customers that seek to partner with a company for large scale multiyear procurements outweighs the potential long-term adverse impacts that could result from taking a transactional versus relationship based approach in the short-term. Turning to Slide 3, I\u2019d like to review some highlights and provide some updates from the quarter. As just mentioned, we booked 11.9 gigawatt since the March earnings call. After accounting for shipments were approximately 1.7 gigawatts, which was in line with our expectation. This brings our total contracted backlog to 36.4 gigawatt. Manufacturing domestics remain strong despite some planned downtime for upgrades in Vietnam in February and March and our Q1 production of approximately 2.1 gigawatts. With regards to supply chain and logistics, as mentioned on our earnings call in March, we have no direct Tier 1 suppliers in the Russian/Ukraine conflict area. However volatility in various supply markets, such as metals, lumber and fuels is further exasperating the current inflationary environment. In addition, we have some indirect exposure through our equipment vendors as relates to the timing of manufacturing delivery of tools for our new factories in Ohio, in India. Moreover, the conflict and current inflationary environment have contributed to dislocations in certain currency markets, Alex will discuss the impact to First Solar later in the call. Regarding freight while pricing in the transoceanic freight market continues to be a historic highs and to represent a headwind in 2022. We have briefly seen increased container availability, which we believe as a result, a China\u2019s pursuit of its zero COVID policy with associated lockdowns. That said, transportation costs and transportation duration continue to be significantly higher in the historic norm. For example, in Q1 shipments from Southeast Asia to the West Coast averaged over 130 days compared to approximately 60 days in 2020. Transit times have been exasperated by the Russia/Ukraine war at several global logistics and shipping companies announced sensations of shipping to Russia, further stranding equipment and vessels and intensifying backlogs and delays in global shipping industry. Turning to Japan, as we noted during our March earnings call. In late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japan project development and O&M platform negotiations related to this potential sale are progressing well. And we expect in Q2 to enter into definitive agreements, to sell these businesses. With closing taking place, following satisfaction of customary closing conditions. As previously noted, should this transaction not be completed for any reason, we would expect to either continue our approach of selling down our contracted projects over time or consider an alternative buyer for the platform. Finally, construction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remain on track. Although with the aforementioned risk related to equipment manufacturing and delivery schedules. Beyond these facilities, we continue to evaluate further expansion opportunities. As we have discussed before with our new factories anticipated to represent the lowest cost of production end of fleet, they\u2019re proximity to demand. And given our large fixed operating cost structure, growth is expected to provide significant incremental contribution margin. As we considered options for growth, we have increasingly been approached to consider further expansions with various financings, ownership and off-take structures. As industry participants continue to embrace the value of entering into long-term partnerships with reliable module suppliers. While we have made no decisions at this time, we have receptive to enabling the ambitions of our partners seeking dedicated supply. To this end, we continue to engage with our tool and equipment vendors to ensure they have visibility into and the ability to support any potential expansion. Turning to technology. We are pleased with the opportunity \u2013 optionality, excuse me. Our current roadmap provides both in terms of enhancing our form factor, product design and energy profile in utility to scale markets, as well as providing a potential route to scale into the residential solar market. With regard to form factor, we expect our Series 7 module, which is to be produced at our new factories in Indiana \u2013 Ohio and India will feature a glass area that is approximately 14% larger than our Series 6 plus modules. Unlike Christmas Silicon modules, which are constrained by the industry standard cell sites and risks such as cell tracking, CadTel has no such form factor or size limitation. A larger form factor benefits our cost per what produced and allows our customers to install more watts with less balance of system cost. In terms of design, we expect the mounting system to be regionally optimized in the U.S. to a tracker application and in India to a fixed tel application. We believe the redesign structure will combine lower cost to produce with greater installed speeds in the field, benefiting both for solar and our customer. As relates to energy, in addition to benefit associated with degradation, temperature coefficient, sector response and shading, our R&D team continues to make progress on developing a bifacial attributes of our CadTel semiconductor. We are continuing to run tests that we expect will enable us to commercialize the technology across our module platforms and have recently produced another set of preproduction prototypes for additional field and product testing as we work to reaffirm the commercial, financial and operational thesis of \u2013 bifacial CadTel. Looking at the residential market. We recognize the value of high efficiency, aesthetically pleasing and domestically manufactured product. To that end, we continue to evaluate the prospect of leveraging the high band gap advantage of CadTel in a disruptive high efficiency low-cost tandem or multi junction device. We believe that a thin film semiconductor is essential to achieving the highest performing tandem PV module. And that CadTel is well placed to enable this leap forward in high performance. With a path in the midterm to achieve a 25% efficient multi junction PV module. As we seek to grow our presence and competitive position in the residential and C&I space, this type of module has the potential to be disruptive and provide us with a competitive advantage. In that spirit, we are in discussions with SunPower to potentially develop and eventually introduce an advanced residential solar panel, a stack tended module platform that combines our advanced thin film CadTel semi conduct with responsibly source crystal silicon cells. We do not intend to disclose further any developments with respect to this discussion, except to the extent an agreement is reached. Finally, as highlighted in our last earnings call, our technology team has been conducting extensive testing to measure the full performance entitlement of cure in high volume manufacturing conditions. Since our last update in March, we have concluded that while the potential for cure remains its implementation will be delayed beyond 2022. We will prioritize other aspects of our R&D stack in the near-term to ensure focus on the three current technology pathways that we believe can be commercialized in the near-term. Series A bifacial CadTel and tandem multi junction devices, the success of these three pathways is not contingent on cure, which will continue to be developed in parallel. We have continued to advance progress on our previously discussed amendment and advanced stage negotiations to amend certain customer contracts, utilizing cure technology by substituting our enhanced Series 6 product. We maintain our expectation that these amendments will impact 2022 revenue and gross margin by approximately $60 million, which is reflected in our guidance. Moving to Slide 4 with the aforementioned 11.9 gigawatts of bookings is the prior earnings call, bringing our total year-to-date bookings to 16.7 gigawatts and factoring in shipments of 1.7 gigawatts in the first quarter are future expected shipments, which extend into 2026, our 36.4 gigawatts. Including our year-to-date bookings, we are sold out for 2022 and 2023, have 9.6 gigawatts for plan deliveries in 2024 and have 7.6 gigawatts for plan deliveries in 2025 and beyond. Including these bookings are gigawatt size deals entered into over the past several weeks with among others, Silicon ranch, interjects renewable energies, and Leeward Renewable Energy for delivery in North America and internationally. Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019d like to take a moment to walk through the recent changes in our contracting structure. This change in approach provides product certainty today. As our baseline ASP is reflective of today\u2019s technology. It further provides ASP upside to the extent we realize future module technology improvements, including new product designs, which deliver a better energy profile for our customers. And finally, it provides greater logistics and commodity gross margin risk mitigation through ASP adjusters, linked to aluminum and sales rate costs. Every contract is different and not every recent includes every adjuster described here. To the extent that such adjusters are not included in a contract. We believe that baseline ASP reflects a commensurate risk and opportunity profile. As it relates to technology and product adjusters, we have previously and will continue to have both upward and downward adjustments to ASPs to reflect the BIM class delivered reflective of the baseline committed under the contract. As it relates to other technology roadmap and product features, under our previous structure, we would forward sell assumed improvements with no upside and a downside risk in the event, these were not achieved. As represented by the red circles on the slide, under our updated structure. We forward sell today\u2019s technology with upside for technology improvements as shown by the green circles. As shown by the dotted box on the side. And as we have reflected in the 10-Q filing as of March 31, 2022, we had approximately the 9.8 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which is if realized, could resolve an additional revenue up to $0.3 billion or approximately $0.03 a lot. Note, of our 4.8 gigawatts of calendar quarter bookings, 1.4 gigawatt did not include technology adjusters, but with price with an approximate 10% premium, the remainder of the calendar quarter of bookings. As relates to standard versus high load modules, our previous structure assumed a certain mix. And any deviation from that mix could imply greater high load modules, which have a higher cost per watts reduce, could have in reduced gross margin. Under our updated structure, we have received an increased ASP to offset this additional cost, therefore preventing gross margin erosion as represented by the blue circle on the slide. As it relates to sales trade and aluminum, we were previously exposed to incremental costs and logistics and commodity markets under our updated structure, we have contractual adjusters designed to offset such incremental costs and prevent gross margin and erosion. As of today, we have 23.2 gigawatt of contracts with either sales freight coverage or no sales freight exposure. The aluminum coverage class was introduced after Q1 quarter end and is in present in 11 gigs of our most recent bookings. Indicatively, assuming today\u2019s sales tray and aluminum environment, a contract with these sales rate and aluminum adjusters with increased ASPs by approximately $0.03 per watt above the baseline. Finally, as it relates to policy, many of our updated contracts in the United States now specify sharing related to a potential upside for U.S. made modules under an extension of the investment tax credit. As reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remains robust. Even after booking 11.9 gigawatts in less than 60 days, our total bookings opportunity of 54.1 gigawatts. Our 23.7 gigawatts of mid-to-late opportunities include 16.1 gigawatts in North America, 5.4 gigawatts in India, 1.7 gigawatts in the EU and 0.5 gigawatts across other geographies. We are especially encouraged by the continuing growth in our India pipeline, which we believe positions us well to realize multi-gigawatts of bookings over the next several quarters. The global sustained market demand is driven by the fact that we are on the edge of a new age of electrification. One in which essentially everything that can be electrified will be. It is our next big evolutionary leap and our best bet at fighting climate change. As we power transportation and virtually every aspect of our lives, including power producing fuel cells with electricity. Before turning over the call to Alex on Slide 7, I would like to address recent policy developments in the United States, Europe and India. Trade and industrial policy decisions and the upending of the global geopolitical status quo both play a significant role in impacting market dynamics as well as continuing to inform our growth strategy. Starting with the U.S. in late December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which received widespread by partisan support in Congress. This acts rebuttable presumption against the importation of goods produced in the Xinjiang region soon to be produced with forced labor is set to go into effect in June this year. There exist practical solutions to reduce the risks of purchasing modules associated with forced labor. For instance, the Responsible Business Alliance, the world\u2019s largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and wellbeing of workers and communities in the global supply chain offers the leading standard for onsite compliance verification and effective shareable audits in the form of its validated assessment program. Yet this established model has not been widely adopted by the solar industry, but the First Solar being the first and at this point only large solar manufacturer to join RBA. In our view, transparency and traceability are crucial to reinforcing our industry\u2019s social license to operate. The transition to a sustainable energy future and the fight against climate change must not come at the price of human rights. Turning our focus to domestic and trade policy. The Biden inherits administration as the opportunity to deliver a meaningful and durable long-term solar industrial policy through the use of a manufacturing incentive. We remain fully engaged in advocating for legislation that would revive climate and clean energy investment, including the framework for manufacturing tax credits established by the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act introduced by Senator Ossoff. On the trade front, in response of addition by Auxin Solar, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated anti-circumvent inquiries against crystalline silicon imports to the United States that undergo minor processing if any at four Southeast Asia countries. We believe this is a positive step towards addressing the problem of mainly crystalline silicon Chinese modules and cells that are completed in Southeast Asia in an attempt to avoid tariffs. For too long, the American solar manufacturing industry has been undersea from the Chinese headquartered in subsidized companies that have been violating the rules of free and fair trade. The data shows that since the underlying anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese cells and modules were put in place, the value of Chinese imports to the United States decreased by 86%. During the same period, the value of imports from four Southeast Asia countries that issued increased by 868%. Prior to the underlying anti-dumping and countervailing orders, there was virtually no crystalline silicon cells and modules produced in these four Southeast Asian countries. There is still a very limited polysilicon ingot or a wafer production in these nations. Instead they source the high value wafers from China, which controls 99% of global crystalline silicon wafer production. Additionally, China is the dominant supplier of the other key imports \u2013 inputs, such as aluminum, silver plate, UVA sheets, back sheets, aluminum frames and junction boxes. Simply the data truly speaks for itself. We\u2019ve heard The Sky Is Falling narrative pushed by Robin Hood\u2019s advocating for China to have free rein in the U.S. market. Their doom and gloom is telling it suggests that they are afraid that the Department of Commerce will find that the Chinese solar manufacturers in fact, engage in circumvention and will hold them accountable for their unfair and unlawful trade practices. While the obvious characterize Auxin as a single company seeking to inappropriately exploit the law. It is precisely cases like this that the law are designed for. Indeed Commerce has conducted 85 circumvention inquiries covering all types of industries and of these approximately 80% have been decided in the firm. We also reject the false narrative that Commerce investigation and pursuit of the rule of law will adversely impact the administration\u2019s climate ambitions. Trading away responsible ultra low carbon solar manufacturing for dependency on China is deeply misguided because China polysilicon is heavily reliant on cold produced electricity. When the price of coal goes up, so does the price of polysilicon and crystalline silicon solar panels, whether it produced in Xingyang or in the United States emissions exasperate the global climate crisis, smoke facts, not visible from Pennsylvania avenue are no less harmful to the environment. To be clear, the anti-circumvention investigation is not about prohibiting imports, but about ensuring the imports compete fairly in the U.S. market. We welcome the robust international competition and it\u2019s fair and rules based backdrop. The problem today is that dumped and subsidized imports distort competition and cycles of innovation with the Chinese government warping investment decisions and dictating outcomes. The rules are enforced, we are confident that the U.S. solar demand will be met and that we will have a stronger American solar manufacturing industry serving as a secure environmentally responsible source of supply. More broadly, we firmly believe that the United States need a combination of durable industrial policy, smart trade policy and the enforcement of the rule of law in order to build back American solar manufacturing and innovation. At no point should this vital transition to a sustainable energy future come at the cost of American jobs, investment, innovation and national energy security. Moving to Europe. We are seeing three pivotal shifts in the policy space. The first is the growing momentum around accelerating renewable energy deployments and bringing forward targets. The second is the recognition that the dependencies on authoritarian states are strategic vulnerabilities. And the last is the rapid strengthening of bilateral transatlantic relationships. All three factors are being driven by Russia\u2019s evasion of Ukraine earlier this year. With regards to renewable deployment, face not just with the risk and uncertainty of gas supplies, but also the prospects of continuing to funnel billions of dollars to Russia through gas purchases, European leaders are working to speed up the region\u2019s energy transition. The European Union\u2019s REPower EU initiative aims to cut the dependency on Russian gas by deploying more renewable and accelerating R&D in future fuels such as hydrogen. Individual European countries are accelerating their transition plans. For instance, Portugal aims to have 80% of its electricity come from renewables by 2026, up from the original target of 60% in the same timeframe. Germany is also moving forward with a goal to double renewable energy generation from 40% today to 80% by 2030, an increase of 15 percentage points over the previous target. Significantly the coalition government in Berlin included a cause in the renewable energy legislation package, acknowledging that renewable energy deployment is in the best interest of country security. With regards to strategic vulnerability there\u2019s growing concern in the EU about replacing energy dependency on one authoritarian state with another, including and especially China, which applies virtually all of the solar panels to the region. European leaders are underscoring China\u2019s position as a systematic rival and threat that operates in an opposition to Europe\u2019s social and democratic model, liberal values and recognition of international law. Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of the bilateral relationships between the EU and the United States. Near-term cooperation is focused on the immediate needs to alleviate gas shortages in Europe, longer-term shared climate sustainability and energy security goals can lead to more collaboration on clean energy technologies and their deployment. As both the United States and Europe work through their challenges of rapidly scaling domestic solar manufacturing capacity, they should consider the template that India has established. There are a few better examples of how a combination of trade safeguards, manufacturing incentives and tangible clean energy goals can spur domestic manufacturing than India. Today India is expected to have 40 gigawatts of new sale capacity and 50 gigawatts of new module capacity come online by 2025. If all of this new capacity does materialize, it would not only make India self sufficient, but it would also create a significant amount of export capacity. This is a direct result of the effective combination of tariffs and non-tariffs barriers to level the playing field. The Indian government\u2019s production length incentive scheme for domestic manufacturing and government clean energy targets that would see 25 gigawatts of new capacity deployed every year until the end of the decade. India\u2019s all of government approach is clearly working and is perhaps one that we can all learn from. It\u2019s now my opportunity to turn the call over to Alex who will discuss Q1 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 8, I\u2019ll cover the income statement highlights for the first quarter. Net sales in Q1 were $367 million, a decrease of $540 million compared to the prior quarter. Decrease in net sales was primarily driven by a lower module volumes sold reflecting seasonality and increased transit times and lower average module ASPs as well as a decrease in revenue from our residual business operations following a sale of free projects in Japan in Q4 of 2021. On a straight-line basis, the module segment revenue in Q1 was $355 million compared to $690 million the prior quarter. Gross margin was 3% in Q1 compared to 27% in Q4 of 2021. Q1 module segment gross margin was 3% down from 21% in Q4 of 2021 and was negatively impacted by $4 million or 1 percentage point of gross margin of under utilization expense stemming from planned down time for throughput and technology upgrades. Additionally sales freight warranty expense included in our cost of sales reduced module segment gross margin by 14 percentage points in Q1 compared to 13 percentage points in Q4 of last year. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $64 million in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately $4 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower R&D testing expense. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses totaled $7 million in the first quarter, an increase of $2 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased startup cost associated with our third Perrysburg factory. In Q1 we closed sales of certain international O&M contracts in Chile and recorded a gain on the sale of the business of $2 million. Q1 operating loss was $58 million, which includes depreciation and amortization of $65 million, under utilization and production startup expense totaling $11 million, share based compensation of $4 million and a gain on the sale of certain O&M contracts of $2 million. We recorded a tax benefit of $19 million in the first quarter compared to tax expense of $36 million in the prior quarter. Decrease in tax expense is attributable to the pre-tax loss in Q1 compared to pre-tax income in Q4 of 2021. Combination of the aforementioned items led to a first quarter loss to share of $0.41 compared to Q4 2021 earnings per share of $1.23 on a diluted basis. Next turn to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.6 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Module segment operating cash flow is offset by ongoing project spend in Japan, other operating expenses and capital expenses associated with our new Perrysburg and India factories. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $252 million an increase of $12 million from the end of Q4, primarily associated with loan drawdowns in Japan. As a reminder, all of our outstanding debt continues to be project related and will come off our balance sheet when the corresponding projects are sold. Our net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable security is less debt decreased by approximately $285 million to $1.3 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. And in the first quarter cash flow used in operations were $139 million and capital expenditures were $155 million. Continuing on Slide 10. Our full year 2022 guidance is unchanged from our call in early March. However, I\u2019ll provide some context around some of the risks, uncertainties and opportunities within the year. Firstly, as Mark mentioned, negotiations related to potential sale of our Japan project development and O&M businesses are progressing well. And we\u2019re expecting Q2 to enter into definitive agreements to sell these businesses. The anticipated value in local currency has remained in line with our expectations when we gave guidance in March. Due to the global macroenvironment and the Bank of Japan, maintaining a commitment to economic stimulus and contrasted tightening U.S. monetary policy, the Japanese yen has in the last two months experienced a sudden and significant devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. While we continue to anticipate U.S. dollar pre-tax gain on sale of $270 million to $219 million timing of sale and the state of the currency market that closing may adversely impact that value. Secondly, as it relates to commodities, we continue to see volatility and increased pressure in major commodity markets, including aluminum and lumber. As mentioned our previous guidance call, we continue to face challenges and to validate pathways towards mitigating our aluminum exposure, particularly as it relates to hedging supply from Malaysia and Vietnam factories. Thirdly, the global sales rate environment remains challenging. With Q1 freight costs tracking largely as expected and we continue to see full year sales rate approaching $0.05 per watt or approximately 18 to 20 percentage points of gross margin. And lastly, we maintain our forecasted cost per watt produced reduction from year end 2021 to year end 2022 of 4% to 6% and our flat year-over-year cost per watt sold. Turning to Slide 11, I\u2019ll summarize the key message from the call. From a financial perspective, our Q1 loss to share of $0.41 is in line with our internal expectations and we originate our full year guidance. Operationally, production of 2.1 gigawatts and shipments of 1.7 gigawatts were in line with expectations and we continue to advance that technology roadmap across Series 7 by sociality and tandem multi-junction devices. And finally Series 6 demand has been robust with 16.7 gigawatts of year-to-date bookings, which includes 11.9 gigawatts since the previous earnings call leading to a current contract backlog 36.4 gigawatts. And this includes recent bookings with our updated contracting structure, providing ASP upsides and gross margin risk mitigation. And with that we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead. Philip Shen : Thanks for taking my questions and thanks for sharing all the detail on the contract structure. I have a few on pricing in general. But you had mentioned Mark the $0.03 per watt or $300 million of potential ASP upside for 2023, I think on the Q4 call. So I\u2019d like to explore how much more upside there might be beyond this. For example, which adder is not included in your $0.03 per watt estimate? I believe it\u2019s Series 7 bifacial and origin adders. Can you talk through how much volume in terms of megawatts we could see for each of these in 2023 and what kind of contribute in terms of cents per watt could each represent? And then beyond this, can you talk through how the anti-circumvention chaos may be incrementally supporting even higher base pricing for your base ASP for incremental contracts? And then finally this is more of a housekeeping question for pricing. Our quick calculation for the Q1 ASP is roughly $0.021 a watt that compares with I think Q4 of closer to $0.31 a watts. So that\u2019s a big change. Can you help us understand what\u2019s missing in our calculation, meaning typically your megawatts shipped maybe a little bit different from your megawatts recognized in revenue. So ultimately what was the pricing or ASP in Q1 and what do you expect in Q2 and three? Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : All right. So Phil, let me make sure I understand your first question. And actually, if you look at that contracting slide that we have in the presentation indicative contracting, there\u2019s a dotted box that it\u2019s around, I think four different components. One is the temperature coefficient the long-term degradation rate, bifaciality and Series 7, I think is the four that it\u2019s around. And if you look down at the bottom, there\u2019s a note down there that indicates that that is reflected in the 10-Q disclosure. So that three \u2013 up to $300 million number that we reference is taking the value of those four items into consideration. You referenced a few things around, well, what\u2019s not included. So yes, there are certain things that are not included such as domestic content. So if we source from our facility in Ohio, whether existing facility or new facility there are some provisions in our contracts that would say there\u2019s a premium for U.S. made content and that\u2019s even independent of whether or not it even gets captured in a U.S. content ITC. So we highlight at the bottom of the slide that another thing that we\u2019ve done with our contracts is that it\u2019s the extent that there becomes a U.S. content criteria that is used for the ITC. We\u2019ve contracted that now to provide upside. So there\u2019s pretty significant value uplift for that 10 percentage point, which is what\u2019s currently being considered for domestic content for ITC. But beyond that there\u2019s also a domestic source content that some of our customers just would rather have U.S. made and domestic source product. And to the extent they do, there\u2019s a premium that we are asking for in order to reserve that type of allocation from that factory. As it relates to the anti-circumvention and the impact to pricing. Look, it\u2019s pricing and it\u2019s not just near term, but as you can see we booked 12 gigawatts since the last earnings call. And a lot of that is going out into 2024, 2025 and even we\u2019re starting to see some momentum going into 2026 as well. That\u2019s obviously a strong indicator fundamentals underlying demand. And one of the things that we alluded to in our prepared remarks is we refer to as this kind of the edge of electrification and kind of this revolutionary age that we\u2019re in right now. We are seeing a lot of really strong demand. And the way I always sort of positioned it from our perspective, we sit on the front end. So we are enabler of that electrification. And so you have to start off with taking photons and making electrons, and then whatever evolution happens for electrification or transportation or building or other sources of fuels and other things along those lines, we\u2019re going to be a critical strategic enabler of that. And we\u2019re starting to see a lot of momentum and demand in the marketplace right now, especially for green hydrogen and green not just in maybe some of the places you would anticipate it maybe in the Middle East or in Europe that in India, and even here in the U.S., we\u2019re starting to see some inflection points around that. So there\u2019s just a strong fundamental underlying demand for our traditional PV and PBS market. But also as we\u2019re starting to see inflection points now with new demand curves starting to come off for things such as green hydrogen and green ammonia. We are seeing better pricing. If you look at the backlog of where we are, our baseline price has improved from the average that was there at the end of the year. And then when you factor in the benefits of the technology adjusters that we have as well as to the extent that sales rate stays inflated, where it is now, and as well as with aluminum. The combination of those two could add up to $0.06 a watt to where our current pricing is on the baseline. But anyway, we\u2019re encouraged. We\u2019re seeing the positive signs. I\u2019ll let Alex talk a little bit more about Q1 ASP. Alex Bradley : Yes. So on the ASP side, the shipped volume was about 1.7, on a sold basis it was more like 1.3. So if you do the math on 1.3 against about 303, I think 55 of module revenue get somewhere around $0.27 and change on an ASP basis. And what you\u2019re seeing there is so, volume on a sold basis is down partly there\u2019s some seasonality, right? Typically Q1 is a lower down sold quarter for us. It ramps through the year. You\u2019ve got a little bit of impact there, so we had more DDP versus CIP terms in Q1 relative to last quarter. And then you\u2019ve got transit time as Mark said in prepared remarks. We\u2019re still seeing times into the U.S. being a record highs up at over 130 days in Q1. So you\u2019ve got those impacts coming through. And on the gross margin side, there\u2019s a little bit of a mix shift as well, which is impacting us. So you\u2019ve got actually got a bit more carry per volume on the sold volume coming through in the gross margin. It\u2019s a little bit offset as you get some benefit in the sales rate there, which is why, if you look at sales rate on a gross margin percentage point basis in Q1, it was down at 14 points, so the full year expectation of the guide 18% to 20%. So you\u2019ve got a little bit offset there, some higher cost, co-product a little bit of benefit sales rate coming through, but that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got this lower sold volume and the impact you\u2019re seeing the gross margin. Mark Widmar : Yes. But, I think Phil, when you look \u2013 maybe to answer your broader question as well, is that we\u2019re seeing strong demand. We feel like we\u2019re getting attractive pricing in the market. We\u2019re continuing to drive cost down as Alex as indicated, even the backdrop of all the challenges we\u2019re dealing with, we still anticipate a 4%, 6% cost per watt reduction. And then as we highlighted before Series 7, when introduced will be the lowest cost products in our fleet. So that\u2019s even a lower cost profile than we have today. So the combination of all those, you couple that with the contribution margin flow through from incremental growth, we\u2019re pretty excited about 2023 and beyond, and the opportunities that we\u2019re positioned for right now and continuing to look to grow beyond what we already have committed to with the strong backlog that we have right now. Philip Shen : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : Thank you, guys. Maybe just to kind of take a step back, going back to when you had module gross margin targets, I think greater than 25% way back. If I put all this stuff together in that Slide 5 and technology advancements, how does that shape up versus that original outlook? And then I have a follow up. Mark Widmar : Yes. So Ben, I think if you just look at \u2013 I mean, right now, when you pull out the effects of sales rate on the quarter, I think we\u2019re in the high teen, 17%, 18%, something like that from a gross margin without the impact of sales rate. And if you \u2013 if you then include the technology adjusters, which is another 10 percentage points on top of that, you\u2019re going to get to a gross margin that\u2019s going to be net 25% or north of that 25% number that you reference. So that\u2019s one way to look at. The other way to look at it, Ben, if we had the commodity adjusters in this current quarter, we would\u2019ve added 10 percentage points to where we are right now, including the impact of sales rate from the commodity standpoint. And we also had a very low shipment quarter. I mean, this is one of our lowest shipment quarters that we\u2019ve had in a long time, as Alex indicated 1.3, sold quarters. 1.3 gigawatts is one of the lowest quarters that we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s obviously drawing kind of weight against some of our fixed costs in our production facilities that drove to a lower gross margin. You\u2019ll see that being leveraged as we grow sales volume as we expand throughout the year, we\u2019ll be averaging close to around 2.5 or 2.6 gigawatts a quarter, so essentially double where we are right now on a sold basis to hit our revenue targets for the year. Alex Bradley : Yes. I think if you look at the backlog that we give in the Q, you\u2019ll see the number tomorrow, you\u2019re going to still see $0.27 ASPs. We had a very large booking quarter, so you\u2019re seeing ASPs relatively flat going out of years. And as we talked about on the call, important to understand that\u2019s a baseline number. And we talked about there being up to $0.03 of technology out, essentially another $0.03 of sales freight is relative to where we are today. And in that same timeframe, you will have cost reduction as well, ongoing. So you\u2019re seeing ASPs flats to rising over time, cost reduction coming down, and then you add volume on top of that. Ben Kallo : Great. And then congrats on the bookings. How do you think about with the backdrop that you outlined of all the legislative and regulatory positives potentially for you? How do you think about the expanding capacity as you sign up contracts? And thank you very much. Mark Widmar : Yes. So look what we\u2019ve always said that we want demand to drive supply for us, right? And when you look at the bookings momentum, I mean, if you look at right now, we\u2019ve got 36 gigawatts in our pipeline. If you go back last year at this time, we were about 15 gigawatts. We\u2019ve added 21 gigawatts to the backlog within a 12 month period. And the momentum, if you look at the pipeline, still is 50 gigawatts, 55 gigawatts of a total pipeline. And as I alluded to, I can easily see over the next several quarters capturing multi-gigawatts volume in India, which we\u2019ve been very patient in terms of taking that volume at this point in time to ensure we get optimal pricing and what we want to capture in India. I think we\u2019re in a good spot there right now. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by the middle of this year that we\u2019re largely sold out through 2025 \u2013 2024, excuse me. We\u2019ve got a few more gigawatts. We got a knockout India, which I think we could be in a good position as well as some more volume here in the U.S. of a few gigawatts, we could be in a good position of having 2024 sold out and even a more meaningful position into 2025. All that sort of gives us the backdrop and the policy support and the environments that we\u2019re seeing in our three primary markets that we want to stay focused on, which is India, the U.S. and Europe, I think there\u2019s some pretty strong inflection points right now for us on a policy standpoint and markets that are compelling for us. And one of the things we said was what we continue to want to do with our capacity expansion is to be close to end markets, right, to get out from underneath, the ocean freight exposure and the challenges that they can create and the headwind on cost. And so I think thinking through those are three primary markets with robust recurring demand could be pretty attractive as we think about capacity expansion. But overall, I think the building blocks are coming together pretty nicely as we think through that. Alex Bradley : Ben, one thing I\u2019ll add. Our technology is being unique and different so is our toolset and the manufacturing required for that. So we\u2019ve been engaging with suppliers to ensure that we have line of sight on critical path tools for further expansion. So we continue to have those discussions with our suppliers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Maheep Mandloi : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Through customers revised pricing structure. Can you just provide some more visibility around how many contracts and the backlog are under this new structure with reference to the slide in today\u2019s tech or is it fair to assume only the booking since the Q4 call have this new structure and also just wanted to get a thoughts on the cadence we should expect for 2022 in terms of shipments or revenue recognition. Thanks. Mark Widmar : So if you look at on a sales freight, I\u2019ll just go through the various adjusters. So we\u2019ve got sales freight adjuster, and I believe that\u2019s like about a little bit north of 23 gigawatts so 23 gigawatts out of the 36 or so. The aluminum adjusters about 11 gigawatts out of the, again, we just started contracting that way since the really last earnings call, which was March 1. So about 11 gigawatt under the aluminum, under the technology adjusters you\u2019re going to see in the queue and we announce it effectively, it\u2019s 10 gigawatts that we believe will be able to capture the number that we have contracted that way is higher. I think the number could be closer to around 16 gigawatt or so, but what we identify in the queue is it ties up into our roadmap of our bifacial implementation rollout, our Series 7, our Temco and delegation improvement profile. So we kind of model that and what the replication and its reach of those technology initiatives. And then how does that roll out relative to what our current delivery schedules look like. But if those push out, for example, if we hold our technology roadmap and the actual schedule for some of those push out, then there\u2019s potentially upside that we can capture beyond just what\u2019s been identified. So that that\u2019s kind of the profile of what\u2019s in the backlog. What I would just continue to say is that we are \u2013 everything we\u2019re contracting going forward is largely under this construct, but for if somebody wants to pay a higher price, right. So in some cases, customers are going to say, look, I\u2019ll just pay for all in everything now and not worry about the adjusters, because it may be easier to get it through their regulator, right. They got to go to the commission, they got to get approval for the CapEx. They\u2019d rather have it all in number. So they go down that path, right. Some others may say, well, it\u2019s easier for me to get my financing and what have you. And therefore I want an all in number and we\u2019ll provide that it has an uplift enter a premium and some cases, some customers may go the other route and they may say sales freight in particular, I\u2019ll just pick it up myself. So we also have some contracts where customers are saying, look, just give it to me that works. So I don\u2019t have to take any risk on now. I\u2019ll let them take the whole thing. And I don\u2019t have to worry about it and we just deliver the project, outside of the factory walls and then they take it from there. So we try to highlight in that slide that not all contractors is the same, but what I would say is in each case, what we\u2019re trying to do is to capture the highest value for the technology, not only today, but the future technology as it evolved and also put us in a much better position and a risk reward, balanced position with our customers on things like commodities and sales freight and the like. Alex Bradley : Yes, as it relates to the cadence of shipping and RevRec, there\u2019s a lot of variability given, as we mentioned, the transit times being higher, lot of our uncertainty around sales freight, obviously we have more visibility to our U.S. transit. And that helps, but I would say you\u2019re going to definitely see a backend profile so you can expect to see a little more, probably closer to two-thirds versus half of shift volume and sold volume being recognized at the second half of the year versus first. But again, a caution there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around that number, just given what we\u2019re seeing in the shipping transition, shipping market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Joseph Osha : Hello. Thank you. Just for the record, I want to state I\u2019m completely in agreement with your position on the Chinese supply chain. Just want to state that upfront. I\u2019ve got two questions. First, just wondering how your EPC partners are doing in terms outside of your product area, cables, labor, racking all that, what you\u2019re hearing from them in terms of the ability to get projects completed. And then my other question relates to your plans for expansion, you talked about working with other parties, but you\u2019ve maintained a very quick clean balance sheet. I\u2019m wondering with this much high quality backlog, whether we might see you maybe potentially look at levering the balance sheet in order to continue to drive the manufacturing expansion. Thank you. Mark Widmar : Yes, I will take the first one that obviously the expansion and leverage. Like nobody\u2019s immune from the challenges in the supply chain right now. And because \u2013 it\u2019s one thing on the model side, but we\u2019re also seeing it on our new tool sets right. Of trying to identify and make sure that all the critical components that go into the tool sets that are needed are available throughout the supply chain. And we\u2019ve been working very closely with our tool vendors to make that happen or to ensure that happens, good availability as possible. And it\u2019s challenge and it\u2019s no different than with our EPC partners and the challenges that that they\u2019re dealing with. And the reality, in some cases it can be something very small and would be perceived as insignificant, but it could be a major constraint, a connector or whatever it may be could become a constraint to the overall project. Everyone\u2019s trying to work around that in some cases. And a lot of cases you\u2019re even seeing a lot of people installing the structures as quick as possible, even though the panels aren\u2019t there, because they know they\u2019re going to run other long lead time constraints and challenges that they\u2019re working through. But yes, they\u2019re dealing with the same supply chain constraints that all of us are at this point in time. I really don\u2019t see anyone being immune. Alex Bradley : Yes. Because it relates to expansion. I would say right now, by the end of the year, we\u2019ll spend about $1 billion of the roughly $1.4 billion associated with the two new Series 7 plants and that lines up with our year end forecasted net cash balance about $1.2 billion at the midpoint of guidance. If you think about beyond that, the next year we have another 300 to 400 or so of CapEx associated with those plants, but you\u2019re also going to have the first production coming from those plants. Plus you\u2019ve got all the Series 6 products up and running, so the business should be cash generative next year. You\u2019re right. We haven\u2019t levered up the balance sheet. We do have the ability to potentially lever up with some debt against the India facilities. So we\u2019ve been in discussions and I think we\u2019ve disclosed the potential for leverage, but we sit at the corporate level, which would really be linked to the expansion in India actually around 500 million or so of capital capacity there pretty attractive terms. Going beyond that, I would say that we could add an incremental factory without stressing the balance sheet. Again, that 1.2, 1.3 is net. So the gross number is higher will be cash generative next year. And as we\u2019ve come out of the systems business the working capital and volatility around the business decreases. Now beyond that, if we were to see opportunity to add significantly more capacity in the near term, as the potential for needing more capital, I think worry to do that right now our read is across debt converted equity to markets are pretty open receptive to capital. I\u2019d also add that if you just look at the timeframe in which we would add capacity, even if we were to make a decision today, it\u2019s going to be 24 months or so before we\u2019ll be able to bring that capacity online. And the spend timing around the land, the building, the equipment is going to push out such that we have more time for the business generate cash as well. So I think right now as we stand we\u2019re in a pretty good position, I don\u2019t see us needing to access the capital markets, but if we were to do \u2013 the desire to do so, I believe those are open to us today. Operator : Our final question will come from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Lee : Hey guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. A lot of moving parts here around some of the contractual adders. So I just want to make sure I\u2019m not misconstruing it. When you said earlier that on that Slide 4 or 5 you\u2019ve got 36 gigawatts of module shipments teed up for the next several years. And then you have the 12 gigawatt that you booked since the last call. What \u2013 I think you made a comment that the contract adders or the commodity adders and/or the technology adders were not applicable for certain percentage of those, is that \u2013 was I right in hearing that, that the 12 gigawatts that you booked since the last call could potentially have the three to six sets of adders, whereas the other 24 gigawatt, because those were sort of older contracts do not. And then just a quick question on the equipment vendors, anything you can elaborate there on in terms of lead times and where you might be seeing some of the most bottlenecks around some of your key equipment and tool sets needed for a capacity expansion. Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : Yes. So let me try to do this again. So let\u2019s just start with the 11.9 gigawatts was booked after the quarter end so April 1 to today. All \u2013 so 11.1 of that would have the aluminum adjuster in it. Okay. So say 11 of the 12. Okay. All that volume would have one or two things on sales freight, either a sales freight adjuster, and I\u2019m talking just the 12 gigawatt or in some cases in this case, in this court in particular, there\u2019s a significant portion of that 12 gigawatts where a customer says, I\u2019ll take the shipping responsibility on my own. So my obligation is to just deliver it to the factory outside the factory door, and then they take it from there. So I have no shipping risk on that. So think of it as it\u2019s either one or two ways it\u2019s protected from shipping, I\u2019ve got an adjustment to shipping it\u2019s the customer if we exceed the cost that\u2019s in the baseline, which generally is around $0.025 or the customer picks it up and therefore my cost is going down at least $0.025. So those are the two. So you got aluminum 11, you got all of it with one form of sales trade protection, either an adjuster to the ASP or the customer\u2019s picking up. And I don\u2019t have to worry about any of the cost at all. Beyond that, so that\u2019s 12 out of the total gigawatts were before year end or after quarter end, excuse me, we have an aggregate in the 20 million and the 36 million. We have 23 gigawatts that has sales freight protection, okay. So 23 of the 36 has sales freight. Okay. 11 of it has aluminum. On the technology adjusters of the 36, there is about 16 gigawatts that has technology adjuster, but only about 10 gigawatts are included in that disclosure that you\u2019re going to see in the queue tomorrow, because that\u2019s the portion of the 16 that we expect to monetize or to realize. Now all of the new stuff, it\u2019s highly probable, but the new stuff is going to be captured, right. But that 12 gigwatt, it\u2019s not in that disclosure. It\u2019s got to put that in there as well. That disclosure that\u2019s going to see \u2013 you\u2019re going to see tomorrow does not include that 12 gigawatts because it was after quarter end. So you could take this 10 gigawatts that we just said that\u2019s in the quarter. And you could add the vast majority of that 12 gigawatts that happen after quarter end and say, yes, that will have a technology adjuster as well. But I just want to make sure it\u2019s clear when you look at what\u2019s in the queue tomorrow, you will not see this additional 12 gigawatts. You won\u2019t see it until the actual filing happens for next quarter. Is that clear, Brian? I just want to make sure. Brian Lee : For delineating all that, that does clarify it a lot. Mark Widmar : Okay. And then as it relates to the tools and what our challenge are, we look \u2013 some of our challenges are chips as well, right. So there\u2019s quite a bit of metrology and data and everything else that we capture through our manufacturing process. So a lot of it\u2019s chip dependency. Now we\u2019ve worked through that. And I actually, as of right now, the last word I got from my team yesterday, I think we\u2019ve resolved a good portion of that, which is good. Now we get into other things like glass, right. So in our ovens, we actually have chambers that you could look down into, right. Because if something happens, in some cases, our ovens could be 75 yards long so we have to have their segment in such a way that you also have these chambers that you look down into, and if something goes wrong inside, or you got to fix or repair, you would then access them from above. And generally there\u2019s a glass opening lid effectively. And we\u2019re struggling with one of our vendors around getting the glass. Now it\u2019s not going to be a constrained. We believe we can still get the tools in. And then when the glass comes, it\u2019s something we can install on site, but won\u2019t be provided upon the initial shipment. So, there\u2019s many different issues, the teams doing a phenomenal job, they\u2019re working each one of these with each one of our tool vendors, bomb item by bomb item for our tool vendors and making sure that they have them and that we can maintain schedules. And they\u2019re thinking through workarounds, but it\u2019s a challenging environment as you can anticipate around supply chain. Brian Lee : All right. Thanks guys. Operator : And that ends the question-and-answers session and today\u2019s conference call. Everyone, thank you for participating, you may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the Company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and technology update. Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter, provide a guidance update and also provide some insight into our pricing strategy and our vision for gross margin expansion. Mark will then provide perspective on the domestic and international policy environment. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. To begin, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including earnings per share of $0.52. This result was benefited by the previously announced closing of the sale of our project development platform in Japan, partially offset by an impairment of the legacy systems business project in Chile, which will be discussed later during the call. We've also continued our booking momentum, further strengthening our backlog of future expected deliveries, which now stands at a record 44.3 gigawatts. The 10.4 gigawatts of new bookings since our prior earnings call in April are mostly for deliveries in 2024 to 2026 time frame and have a base ASP, excluding adjustors of $0.301. These new deals bring our total year-to-date bookings to 27.1 gigawatts. From an ASP perspective, we are encouraged by the pricing trajectory of our bookings as we continue to transact for deliveries as far out as 2026. On an overall portfolio basis, the profile of our annual base contracted ASPs remain effectively flat from 2022 through 2025 with the potential to grow with the application of technology, sales trade and commodity price adjustors applicable to many of these bookings. Firstly, as it relates to technology adjustors, if we are able to realize the achievements within our technology road map, the ASP has potentially increased to reflect the value associated with the enhanced product and energy profile. As of June 30th, we had approximately 20.5 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjustors, which, if realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.4 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized in 2024 and 2025. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate module bin delivery to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards or for those contracts in the United States that include sharing related to potential upside for U.S. main modules under the extension of the investment tax credit. Secondly, the ASP may increase to offset incremental costs as it relates to sales freight. Thirdly, the ASP has also potentially increased to offset incremental costs as it relates to aluminum. With regards to our Series 7 product to be produced at our new factories in Ohio and India, featuring a glass area of approximately 14% larger than our Series 6 Plus modules and utilizing the steel as opposed to aluminum frame, we have also begun to introduce adjustors to offset potential increased steel costs. As a reminder, not every recent contract includes every adjustor described here. To the extent that such adjustors are not included in the recent booked contract, we believe the baseline ASP reflects an appropriate risk reward profile. For example, some of these contracts have delivery terms where the customer is responsible for the cost of sales freight from the factory gate. In summary, we continue to leverage our value proposition of providing our customer and partners with long-term supply certainty, lower political and compliance risk and access to our best available technology. These critical points of differentiation, together with our differentiated CadTel technology, have allowed us to continue to expand our record backlog and an overall pricing that we believe is both, encouraging and competitive and with appropriate risk mitigation. Turning to slide 3. I'd like to review our highlights and some updates from our second quarter. Our manufacturing facilities produced 2.2 gigawatts of modules in Q2. The result was benefited by higher throughput due to faster-than-expected upgrades of certain equipment at our Vietnam manufacturing facilities. As previously disclosed, we have completed the sale of our project development platform in Japan. As we seek to divest our remaining power plant assets, we are evaluating potential buyers for our Luz del Norte project in Chile. Alex will discuss the timing and financial impact of this potential transaction. Construction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remains on schedule. To date, we have seen increased -- increases associated with steel and freight costs. Looking forward, as we continue to explore further manufacturing expansion opportunities, inflationary pressures on building equipment and freight costs are expected to remain a concern. Finally, we've entered into a $500 million debt facility with our new -- for our new manufacturing facility in India, with the first disbursements expected in the third quarter. Before turning to shipments, I would like to say a word about the current sales freight environment. While there are reports that suggest supply chains are beginning to trend towards normalization on a macro basis, global sales freight conditions remain challenging. Although spot rates for ocean freight have fallen quarter-over-quarter, these benefits were partially offset by increased fuel costs. In addition, we are approaching the peak period in terms of delivery of goods ahead of the year-end holiday season, which represents a potential headwind that may render the recent easing in the shipping rate as a temporary phenomenon. From a logistics perspective, we are still experiencing the impact of port congestion. In the United States, after brief reprieve, we have seen a continuous buildup of congestion on the East Coast as some shippers divert away from the West Coast port to avoid the potential impacts of ongoing labor negotiations. For example, the queue of ships looking to berth at the Port of Savannah has recently increased to 30 vessels, up from zero in the previous quarter. While transit times from Asia to the United States have improved, they remain well above the pre-pandemic averages. In fact, combined with challenges such as port congestion and blank sailings, has led to an estimated 12% reduction in global shipping capacity. Notwithstanding these challenges, we continue to execute on our strategy of employing freight risk-sharing mechanisms in our customer contracts, with nearly all of our recent bookings, either featuring contractual adjustors designed to offset incremental sales freight cost or allocating all ocean freight responsibility to the customer, in either case mitigating gross margin erosion. As of today, we have 32.7 gigawatts of contracts in our backlog that with either sales freight coverage or no sales trade exposure. As you may expect, contracts where customers take on responsibility for the transport have lower ASP than those where we are responsible for shipping. By way of example, one such contract, which is included in the revenue from contracts from customers' footnote in the quarter's 10-Q, is a 2.3 gigawatt sale to a highly valued long-term partner. This volume targeted for low-bin inventory is contracted to supply from our international factories, with the customer being responsible for transportation, which is currently estimated to be $0.04 to $0.05 per watt. Therefore, the ASP for this transaction is lower than the average of the ASP for other sales contract entered into in the period. Note, 4.9 gigawatts of the 11.9 gigawatts, increase in contracts from customers for future sales, includes -- included in the revenue from contracts from customers' footnote in this quarter's 10-Q requires that customers take on the responsibility for shipping. As First Solar had this shipping responsibility, we estimate that the implied ASP of this 10 -- 11.9 gigawatts volume increase would have risen by approximately $0.02 per watt. Of note, we expect the majority of our India factory output to be contracted on an ex works basis, with the customer picking up modules at the factory gates and assuming all transportation costs. Accordingly, we believe headline ASPs in India will be lower than in other markets where we include an assumption of sales freight within the ASP. That said, Alex will address why we expect gross profit per watt for the India factory to be equal or higher than the fleet later in the call. Turning to slide 4. We address our recent shipments. As just mentioned, we booked 10.4 gigawatts since the April earnings call. With respect to future shipments after accounting for shipments in the quarter of approximately 2.5 gigawatts, which is in line with our expectation, our total contracted to-date backlog is 44.3 gigawatts. We are sold out for 2022 and '23 as of April's earnings call and now sold out for 2024, excluding our new India manufacturing facility. We have 12 gigawatts for planned deliveries, excluding India, in 2025 and have 2.6 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2026 and beyond. As it relates to our India factory, we have seen significant near- and longer-term demand from domestic customers as we anticipate entering into first contracts for the output of this factory within the coming months. Under our bookings policy, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As such, deals signed but not fully secured will be reflected with the confirmed but not booked portion of our pipeline graph in the earnings presentation. The 10.4 gigawatts booked since April earnings call include an order for 2.4 gigawatts of modules of one of the largest -- one of our largest standing customers, U.S. headquarter, Intersect Power, announced earlier today. These modules are scheduled for delivery in 2025 to 2026, further expanding the horizon for our backlog. This booking is reflective of a broader trend among longstanding U.S.-based customers to strengthen their commitment to First Solar's CadTel thin film technology as they seek long-term pricing security, supply certainty and value for their project pipeline. We are seeing greater geographical diversity in our bookings at among customers negotiating long-term framework supply agreements. Notably, European developers are increasingly recognizing the risk of relying on supply chains that are concentrated in China. As just one example, the French developer, Akuo, which has placed an order for 500 megawatts for its project portfolio in the U.S. and in Europe. Our bookings momentum demonstrates the growing recognition of the risk of pursuing a solar at any cost strategy. Developers that have built excessive dependencies on China state subsidized solar industry are grappling with an increasing volatile pricing and supply environment. A prime example of this increased risk profile is a recently reported lawsuit filed against a top-tier Chinese solar manufacturer, alleging breach delivery obligations, fraud, fraudulent actions and breach agreements related to product traceability information. This direct contrast with the experience of our customers who have benefited from our emphasis on durable partnerships has enabled long-term growth and our ability to stand behind our contracts and deliver on our commitments. Our customers have also benefited from an industry-leading approach to sustainability, transparency and traceability. We believe that our focus on long-term partnerships and our focus on basing of an enduring strategic customer that seeks to partner with First Solar for large-scale multiyear procurements have been key drivers of our success, and it enabled a solid foundation for growth. We also believe that these strategies set us up for enduring success, differentiating ourselves from the highly volatile transactional environment that some of our competitors may operate in and providing longer-term stability and visibility, not just for our customers, but for our shareholders. As reflected on slide 5, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust. Even at the year-to-date bookings of 27.1 gigawatts, we retain long-term total bookings opportunities of 52.5 gigawatts. Our 17.8 gigawatts of mid to late-stage opportunities include 9.7 gigawatts in North America, 3.9 gigawatts in India and 4.2 gigawatts in the EU. In India, we continue to see meaningful potential as it relates to demand from domestic developers foreign owned IPPs operating in the country and the Indian government's efforts to boost demand certainty for domestic manufacturers. Similarly in Europe, we are seeing growing demand where geopolitics and the war in Ukraine have led to an urgent effort to deploy more renewables as the EU works to diversify its energy portfolio. Turning to technology. We are pleased with the progression of our current road map. As previously stated, our road map provides us with a high level of optionality, allowing us to pursue enhancements to our product design and energy profile as well as the path to potentially offer a true next-generation solar module for the residential market. On the last earnings call, we had announced that our R&D teams are continuing to make progress on developing the bifacial attributes of our CadTel semiconductor as we reaffirm the commercial, financial and operational thesis of the bifacial product. As our bifacial program evolves from the research level to large preproduction runs, our R&D team is working to achieve field validation, including operational and reliability data. This is necessary to ensure a viable path to large-scale commercial manufacturing. In parallel, we are working to stand up the supply chain necessary to help support the eventual introduction of a bifacial CadTel module. While we expect manufacturing line modifications to be minor, a bifacial CadTel module will have different material requirements necessitating adjustments to our supply chain. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss Q2 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before reviewing our Q2 results, on slide 6, I'd like to provide an overview of two events, which impact both this quarter's results as well as our full year outlook. Both relate to our legacy systems business and impact our non-module or other business segment. The first is the recently completed sale of our Japanese project development platform and the pending sale of our Japanese O&M platform. The first discussed on our Q4 2021 earnings and guidance call, in late 2021, we received an unsolicited offer to acquire our Japanese project development and O&M platforms. And our full year 2022 guidance assumed a gain on the sale of these businesses of $270 million to $290 million. On our Q1 2020 earnings call in April, we indicated that negotiations toward the sale were progressing well. In May of this year, we entered into definitive agreements to sell these businesses to PAG Real Assets, subject to customary closing conditions. As previously disclosed and mentioned by Mark earlier in the call, in June, the conditions related to the sale of the project development platform were met. And accordingly, we closed the sale of that business for gross proceeds of JPY 66 billion, including a gain on sale of JPY 33 billion. These results were in line with the assumptions included in our full year guidance. However, due to the sudden and significant weakening of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar that has taken place in 2022 largely as a function of the contrast between the Bank of Japan's continued commitment to economic stimulus and the tightening of U.S. monetary policy, the U.S. dollar gain on sale of $245 million was $35 million lower than the midpoint of our previous forecast. From a cash perspective, we received net cash proceeds in Q2 of $262 million with an additional $164 million forecasted to be received within the calendar year. And note, the remaining conditions precedent to close the sale of the Japan O&M platform, including regulatory approvals, receipt of third-party consents and other customary closing conditions, are expected to be met in the second half of 2022. The second event impacting both, Q2 results and full year guidance relates to our 141-megawatt Luz del Norte project located in Chile. As disclosed since last year's second quarter 10-Q filing, we've continued to evaluate whether to hold or pursue a sale of the project. We also noted that should we be unable to recover our net carrying value in the project, any future sale could result in an impairment charge. Given that no decision has been made with regards to a sale, no impact from any potential sale was included in our 2022 guidance. In cooperation with the project lenders, we've recently begun a sale process, and in Q2, received multiple nonbinding bids to acquire the Luz del Norte project. Based on analysis of these bids, in Q2, we recorded a pretax impairment in cost of sales of $58 million and additional tax expense of $23 million associated with the Luz del Norte project. As it relates to the full year, assuming a sale is completed later this year, in line with the bids received to date, we expect revenue of $150 million to $200 million from the sale, a reduction in gross profit of $40 million to $50 million, including the Q2 impairment net of future proceeds from the sale, a $30 million to $35 million benefit to non-operating income from debt forgiveness and reduced interest expense, and $30 million to $40 million of tax expense due to the generation of net operating losses, which no future benefit we received and the jurisdictional mix of the income amongst our Chilean entities. The total net impact from the expected sale of Luz del Norte, which was not previously assumed in our guidance for the year, is a $10 million to $15 million loss before taxes and a $40 million to $55 million loss on a post-tax basis, equivalent to an implied loss per share of $0.38 to $0.52. Note that given the early stages of the sale process and uncertainty around the ultimate structuring of any potential sale, although we believe the forecasted range for revenue, pretax losses, tax expense and after-tax losses to be appropriate, there remains significant uncertainty related to the impact of the gross profit and non-operating income lines of the P&L. With this background, starting on slide 7, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the second quarter. Net sales in Q2 were $621 million, an increase of $254 million compared to the prior quarter. On a segment basis, our module segment revenue in Q2 was $607 million compared to $355 million in the prior quarter. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher module volumes sold and also benefited by sales freight recoveries. Gross margin was negative 4% in Q2 compared to positive 3% in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impairment of the Luz del Norte project, which impacted gross margin by 9 percentage points. Q2 module segment gross margin of 5%, up from 3% in Q1, was positively impacted by increased volumes sold. Additionally, sales freight included in our cost of sales reduced module segment gross margin by 16 percentage points in Q2 compared to 14 percentage points in the prior quarter. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $64 million in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter. Production startup, which is included in operating expenses, totaled $13 million in the second quarter, an increase of $6 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased startup costs associated with our third Ohio factory. We recorded the aforementioned $245 million gain on sale associated with the closing of the sale of the project development platform in Japan. Q2 operating income was $145 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $67 million and the utilization of production startup expense totaling $17 million, share-based compensation of $6 million, gain on the sale of the Japan project development platform of $245 million and an impairment of $58 million associated with the Luz del Norte project in Chile. We recorded tax expense of $84 million in the second quarter compared to a tax benefit of $19 million in the prior quarter. The increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to an increase in pretax profit from the sale of our Japan project development platform and an increase in tax expense related to the Luz del Norte project. A combination of the aforementioned items led to second quarter earnings per share of $0.52 compared to a Q1 loss per share of $0.41 on a diluted basis. I'll next turn to slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash flows generated from operations were $88 million and capital expenditures were $199 million in the second quarter. Our cash, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter at $1.9 billion compared to $1.6 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Module segment operating cash flow and proceeds from the sale of our Japan project development platform were partially offset by other operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with our new Ohio and India factories. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $175 million, a decrease of $77 million from the end of Q1, primarily due to the repayment of a credit facility before transferring the associated project with the sale of the Japan project development platform. All of our outstanding debt is nonrecourse project debt and will come off the balance sheet if the Luz del Norte project is sold. Our net cash position, which includes cash, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, increased by approximately $372 million to $1.7 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Continuing on slide 9. Our full year 2022 guidance is updated as follows. Our previous revenue guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion was predominantly module segment revenue, which remains unchanged. We are adding other segment revenue guidance of $150 million to $200 million for total revenue guidance of between $2.55 billion and $2.8 billion to reflect the expected sale of the Luz del Norte project in the second half of the year. With half year behind us, we have greater clarity into our full year module segment performance. Whilst the midpoint of our module segment gross profit guidance remains unchanged, we've revised the range from $165 million to $225 million to $175 million to $215 million. Our other segment, which previously was forecast to reduce gross profit by $10 million, is now forecast to reduce gross profit by $50 million to $60 million due to the anticipated Luz del Norte sale, resulting in total forecasted gross profit of $115 million to $165 million. Within gross profit, assumptions related to underutilization losses of $10 million to $15 million and a sales freight impact of 18 to 20 points of gross margin remain unchanged. Additionally, our forecasted cost per watt produced reduction from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of 4% to 6%, and our forecasted flat year-over-year cost per watt sold forecasts both remain unchanged. Note, the midpoint of our full year module segment gross margin guidance of approximately 8% remains unchanged from our previous forecast. Following a 3% and 5% module segment gross margin result in the first and second quarters of 2022, module margin improvement is expected to continue in the second half of the year. SG&A and R&D expenses are forecast to total $270 million to $280 million, down from $280 million to $290 million in our previous guidance. In addition, our forecast startup expense of $80 million to $85 million is down from $85 million to $90 million previously for a total forecast operating expenses forecast of $350 million to $365 million. The gain on sale of businesses previously forecasted $270 million to $290 million is now forecast to be $245 million given the aforementioned currency impact. Operating income is estimated to be between $5 million and $70 million, down from previous guidance of $55 million to $150 million as a function of the reduction in the U.S. dollar value of the Japan business sale and the inclusion of the expected Luz del Norte sale in guidance, partially offset by SG&A, R&D and startup expenses savings. Other income and expense guidance moves from $20 million to $30 million of expense in prior guidance to $25 million of income in current guidance as a function of increased interest income and forecast debt forgiveness upon the anticipated sale of the Luz del Norte project. Full year tax expense increases from $35 million to $55 million previously to $55 million to $70 million, following the inclusion of the expected sale of the Luz del Norte project this year, partially offset by a lower-than-forecast gain on sale of the Japan development platform. This results in full year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range of negative $0.25 to positive $0.25. Capital expenditures guidance of $850 million to $1.1 billion and shipments guidance of 8.9 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts remain unchanged. Our year-end 2022 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, an increase of $200 million following the assumed sale of Luz del Norte and the corresponding reduction in project-level debt. Before handing call back to Mark, given our record backlog and significant recent bookings, I'd like to provide some insight into our pricing strategy and our vision for gross margin expansion for the next three years and beyond. The components of this strategy include our approach of contracting out our capacity several years in advance of production, the anticipated reduction of our cost per watt produced, the expected benefits from capacity expansion, including through scaling a largely fixed overhead structure, and our agile contracting approach, which provides for the potential realization of both incremental revenue and is expected to mitigate freight and certain commodity cost risk. Now with respect to our agile contracting structure, every contract is different, and not every recent contract includes every technology and commodity adjustor we've been describing. Accordingly, while we anticipate seeing some incremental revenue contribution and gross margin protection from these adjustors in 2023, the majority of these potential revenue and gross margin benefits, if we're able to achieve our technology road map, are expected to be recognized in 2024 and 2025. Firstly, as it relates to ASPs, between the pricing reflected in the current contracted backlog and the pricing for the bookings realized in July, we expect the profile of our annual base contracted ASPs will remain effectively flat, and therefore, not decline for 2022 through 2025. Against this pricing backdrop, we anticipate a reduction in cost per watt produced from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of between 4% and 6%. Even making the highly conservative assumption of no further reductions to cost per watt produced beyond this point, we expect cost per watt produced exiting 2022 to provide an annual gross margin benefit in 2023 and beyond. On a cost mitigation basis, as it relates to sales freight as well as steel and aluminum costs relative to 2022, we would expect future years to see either a reduced cost profile or should costs remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms, the inclusion of adjustors would provide for an increase in ASP to offset such costs. Under either scenario, we would see an expansion of gross profit relative to 2022. As mentioned on the April earnings call, indicatively, assuming today's sales freight and aluminum environment, a contract with sales freight aluminum adjustors is expected to increase ASPs by approximately $0.03 per watt above the baseline. From a growth perspective, relative to today, we expect the announced Series 7 factories in Ohio and India will add approximately 6 gigawatts of annual production starting in 2024. That additional volume is anticipated to provide significant incremental gross profit. In addition, we see the benefit of scale from our largely fixed operating cost structure as we anticipate adding this capacity with limited incremental OpEx. Assuming the midpoint of our current full year 2022 R&D and SG&A guidance of $275 million, this incremental production reduces combined R&D and SG&A cost per watt by approximately $0.01. As it relates to our Indian manufacturing facility, while ASPs in that market are anticipated to be lower than those in the U.S. and other markets, we expect gross profit per watt for the Indian factory to be equal to or higher than the fleet average. This is due to a combination of factory scale, domestic CapEx incentives and other incentives, lower labor costs and the elimination of ocean freight to deliver the domestically produced product. The combined impact of flat ASPs, cost per watt reduction, sales freight and commodity adjustors and capacity expansion against a largely fixed operating cost base provides a compelling case for gross margin expansion over the period we've been discussing. Moreover, this potential for gross margin expansion is further enhanced to the extent that we're able to make achievements within our technology road map. As described on the April earnings call, under our updated contracting approach, we forward-sell today's technology. To the extent we accomplish future module technology improvements, including new product designs and energy-related enhancements, we have the opportunity to realize incremental revenue under sales contracts that include technology adjustors. As Mark noted earlier, this does not include either potential adjustments to the ultimate bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, or for those contracts in the United States that include sharing related to a potential upside for U.S.-made modules on an extension of the investment tax credit. And finally, the gross profit opportunity described here is within the context of our current capacity plan. Additional capacity would be expected to be gross profit accretive to the above scenario. And while we're not making a new additional plant announcement today, I'll now turn the call back over to Mark, who will provide an update on policy and our current thinking with respect to capacity expansion. Mark Widmar : All right. Thanks, Alex. To conclude, I would like to discuss the rapidly evolving policy environment both at home and abroad. Beginning in the United States, like many in the energy sector, we were pleasantly surprised by yesterday's joint announcement from Senators Manchin and Schumer regarding the Inflation Reduction Act. We are encouraged that yesterday's announcement made a clear reference to investment in energy security and technology-neutral climate change solutions, and we are supportive of the balanced approach to corporate taxation. While we are still reviewing the full legislative tax release last night, we are hopeful that the advanced manufacturing production credit, if passed, helps deliver the incentives required to boost domestic solar manufacturing and secure our nation's energy independence. As the legislative process moves forward, we urge both chambers to move quickly to pass this critical legislation, which represents the first real step to designing a clean energy industrial policy that addresses climate change while simultaneously codifying American energy security. With respect to 45X, the advanced manufacturing production credit, we urge Congress to ensure that the manufacturing tax credit designed to incentivize domestic solar supply chain are fully refundable in order to deliver the intended result. This legislation\u2019s extension of the solar investment tax credit appears to enable crucial demand-side policy certainty. We're hopeful that, if passed, legislation maintain the domestic content in Senate that will help further ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are used to help expand manufacturing here at home. Turning to our considerations to further expand our manufacturing footprint. Our criteria for investment remains unchanged. These include geographic proximity to solar demand, the ability to export cost competitively into other markets, access to cost-competitive labor, low energy and real estate costs, access to or the ability to build a cost-competitive supply chain to support the sourcing of raw materials and components, and as we've repeatedly stated, the domestic policy environment. We agree wholeheartedly with Senator Manchin that the United States needs to remain a global superpower through innovation. As it relates to the potential for our own manufacturing expansion in the U.S., we had previously stated that we were evaluating the potential for future capacity expansion but noted that we first required clarity on domestic solar policy. In light of these latest developments and should the Inflation Reduction Act get passed with consistent language on solar-related tax credits, we plan to pivot quickly to reevaluate U.S. manufacturing expansion. Moving ahead, we continue to be optimistic about the policy environment in Europe and in India. Over the last 10 months, we have met productively with Prime Minister Modi of India and attended the Investment Conference hosted by President Macron of France in addition to having numerous constructive meetings with members of their cabinets. These governments, along with others that are -- we are engaged with are seeking to diversify and grow domestic capabilities. As calls for resilient domestic supply chains grow louder in solar markets around the world, we believe First Solar is uniquely well-positioned to offer a viable alternative based on a proven repeatable vertically integrated manufacturing template. Before I turn the call back to Alex to summarize today's key messages, I would like to note that we have issued our 2022 sustainability report. The report highlights our continued progress across a range of environmental, social and governance metrics, detailing among other accomplishments how we have successfully lowered our environmental footprint while advancing our diversity and inclusion goals. These achievements demonstrate the strength of our commitment to the principles of responsible solar, placing at the heart of our business as we invest in innovation and scale. We are proud that First Solar is an example of how solar can be competitive without compromising our principles and purpose. We have shown that solar technologies can be sustainably scaled without people and the planet paying a high price. Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call. Alex Bradley : Turning to slide 10. From a financial perspective, we're pleased with our Q2 earnings per share of $0.52. We updated our full year guidance to reflect the impact of two discrete legacy systems events. The midpoint of our full year module revenue and gross margin guidance remains unchanged. Operationally, we'll produce 2.2 gigawatts and ship 2.5 gigawatts of modules. Additionally, Series 6 demand remains extremely robust with 27.1 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings, leading to a record contracted backlog of 44.3 gigawatts. The 10.4 gigawatts of new bookings since our prior earnings call in April had a base ASP, excluding adjustors of $0.301. And finally, we're encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act proposed legislation and are currently reviewing this development and its potential impact on our business and capacity expansion plans. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Baird. Ben Kallo : Hey guys. Congrats on the results and the bookings. How do you figure out the optimal manufacturing capacity just because you've been booking so much? And then, [Technical Difficulty] back to Analyst Day [Technical Difficulty] ago, it was greater than 20% [ph] gross margin. How do I do all the puts and takes and kind of square with that? Thank you. Mark Widmar : So Ben, I guess, maybe one way to start, I think we've guided to a number that's, I don't know, 7% or 8% gross margin for the module business in the environment that we're in right now. Okay? This for 2022. So, what Alex has said in his remarks is that obviously, embedded in that low gross margin is the headwinds that we're dealing with around sales freight and with commodities such as aluminum and eventually steel when we introduced Series 7. The impact of that -- the headwind is 11 or 12 percentage points or so of gross margin. So just normalizing for that -- assuming -- it can come through either one away. It can come through as an incremental ASP -- I\u2019m just assuming ASPs stay where they are right now and then we see as a benefit of $0.03 that Alex referenced as a lower cost because sales freight normalizes down to 2.5 cents, which is where our contracts anchored to, and aluminum comes back to historical levels that we have seen previously. So, that gets you basically at your threshold of your 20% relative to what we guided. Now, the guide is also for the full year. And if you look at our gross margin progression, the gross margin is higher in the end of the year. So if you use the exit point, you actually will be north of 20% gross margin. Alex also indicated that we still are -- even though in this challenging environment, we are seeing a cost reduction. So, we are seeing year-on-year cost reduction of about 5% -- 5% to 6%. So, there's an incremental margin expansion there. So when you just layer those together, you're solidly into the 20%. And then if you capture the value of the technology adjustors, then you're meaningfully better than that, right? So, I think everything that we have right now, what we have line of sight to around where we've contracted in terms of our ASPs, and as we've indicated, they're relatively flat or slightly increasing as we go across the horizon. And the other actions that we've taken around our contracting and then capturing the value of our technology road map that we should be very comfortable achieving the minimum threshold of 20%, in my mind, we should do much better than that, but there's still a lot still in front of us to execute on. But I think we've given ourselves a great opportunity to show very strong margin -- gross margin percent as we move forward. Alex Bradley : Yes. Ben, I mean, as you think through the optimum manufacturing capacity, we've always said that we want that to be demand driven, right? And clearly, if you look at the backlog we have today, contracts, if you look at the size of the pipeline, we have supported the pieces behind growth there. If you think through how we think about expanding, we've talked about some of the key drivers being stable policy, demand, locating manufacturing proximity to demand, having a technology advantage or a stable technology platform from which to grow and several other things around competitive labor, real estate, power markets, supply chain, et cetera. If you think about where we've been -- we're challenged recently, there's been a lot of volatility in the policy side of that equation, which has been a key driver. And as Mark mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re obviously hopeful given the news coming out of Washington yesterday afternoon. We're still working our way through that document, a lot to be read there. And look, we're cautiously optimistic. We're very happy that the people are working on that now. We've seen a lot of churn in this over the last couple of months. So, we want to remain cautiously optimistic until we see a natural bill signed into law. But if I look through what drives our potential for expansion, we talked about policy being a key driver. You look at the backlog and the demand that's clearly there. You look at the growth of the macro in terms of solar, both in the U.S., in Europe and in India. And all the markets we've been looking at manufacturing seen the significant opportunity for expansion. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philip Shen with Roth. Philip Shen : As a follow-up on the capacity expansion. If the Inflation Reduction Act does get passed, can you quantify in any way given the demand that you see, and that's before the ITC extension, how many new factories you could actually put up and over what kind of time frame? And then, also in the [indiscernible] part of the bill, there's the $0.04 per watt CadTel sell credit, and then there's the $0.07 per watt module credit. I know we talked about this in the past, back -- last year when this was also active, but can -- how much of the credit do you think you can access? Do you think you can tap into the $0.11 to 7 plus 4, or do you think of the ability to just access the $0.04 per watt? Mark Widmar : So look, Phil, as it relates to capacity expansion, effectively from this point in time, if we -- something here in the U.S. from a point in time, it's going to take us somewhere around 24 months, maybe slightly less. Hopefully, we see some relief in some of the supply chain challenges that we've been dealing with over the last couple of years. So, maybe we can do something faster. But by the time you put a greenfield with a new building and then the tools, the good thing about it, as we've mentioned previously, is we've been working with our vendors to keep them teed up, knowing that there was going to be another factory. We're actually very pleased with the -- where we are right now and the tool move-in scheduled that we're seeing and Perrysburg 3 and then what we have currently lined up for the India expansion, so. And we've told our vendors, we want to have a cadence of six months after that for at least one more factory and maybe we'd go beyond that given the current environment and the options that we have, not only here in the U.S., but in the EU in India as well. So, it's about a 24-month window. EU could be a little bit faster because we still do have a facility in Eastern Germany that potentially could be utilized for incremental production. But here in the U.S. and even in India, it's going to be on a longer time line accordingly because of that the challenge we're dealing with right now with the supply chain, and maybe we'll see some relief. But, the way I look at it in terms of priorities, if the Inflation Reduction Act goes forward, I think at least one new utility-scale factory, we would love to complete our discussion and operationalize our tandem product that we referenced as -- in a partnership with SunPower for residential market. So that's in the mix as well. And maybe could we throw another U.S. factory into the mix? There's a potential. But I'm also trying to make sure we're looking at every other avenue to get incremental throughput if this goes through. For example, our team has done a phenomenal job of driving incremental throughput through the existing factory. So, let's look at additional constraints within the factory. Where is the constraint? Can we add some capital to the existing production here in the U.S., the 6 gigawatts or so that when we get Perrysburg 3 up and running to add another tool that can increase throughput at the constraint that allows you to optimize across the entire tool set? There's another path there to drive more throughput across the platform, which is one thing that we clearly want to continue to look at. As it relates to the Inflation Protection Act, and in particular, the 45X provision, look, we believe -- and again, we still need to go through, read everything and to consult with everyone that -- to ensure our interpretation is accurate. We believe that we have a full entitlement to the $0.04 plus the $0.07, which would be the sell-in module. The other thing, Phil, I think I've said to you in the past is that the spirit of the legislation, which largely is the same as what was originally in prior versions, was to ensure thin film was not going to be competitively disadvantaged relative to crystalline silicon. And so, the structure and the way it's worded if it were to be passed as it is right now, we also believe that we would benefit from the wafer. And the wafer provision, I think, is $12 per square meter. So, you take that, our modular Series 6 today is about 2.5 square meters, which would imply there's about -- on a module basis, not on a cents per watt basis, there's potentially $30 benefit per module. So, that's another lever that we are going to try to make sure we can go and capitalize on. That one -- again, we believe the intent is to do that, but it's another area that we have to work on. But we want to make sure that anything that is finally passed into law that we are not at all competitively disadvantaged and that we're fully entitled to all the benefits that other technologies such as crystalline silicon would be able to capture. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Maheep Mandloi with Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi : Could you just clarify the base ASPs assumption? I think you made a comment on not declining from '22 to '25. And what puts and takes should we kind of expect to that ASP going forward? Thanks. Alex Bradley : What was the last part of the question? Maheep Mandloi : Just puts and takes with that, just with the adjustors and for aluminum steel in shipping and other things. Alex Bradley : Yes. So what we said is if you look at what's in the backlog today, we expect the ASPs to be roughly flat going from 2022 out to 2025. If you think about where we are now and you'll see in the Q coming out, and we've talked about where we were, Q1, Q2. You're somewhere in the range of $0.27 to $0.28 ASPs. And we're saying that on a base level, we expect that to be roughly flat out through the 2022 to 2025 horizon. But remember, as I said in my comments, that base ASP is reflective of effectively today's technology. So, when you look at puts and takes around the ASP, you've got potential upside to that based on technology adjustments, should we achieve within our technology road map things that provide more energy or more value to the customer, and those are built into contracts to a large extent today. So, when you look at the ASP side, you have that other key adjustment. You have to ASP, its protection around sales freight and commodities. So, in the event that commodity prices and sales freight remain elevated relative to the norms that we saw pre-pandemic, and typically, the ranges that we assume in our cost structure today, we would have an increased ASP to offset that incremental cost. So, you'd have that adding on as well. So those are the key moving pieces that we see around ASP. Mark Widmar : Yes. And I want to just make sure, it's clear because sometimes people want dismiss, well, if commodities or sales freight normalize, then there won't be any benefit to the ASP adjustors. Completely understand. But what it means is our cost per watt will decline then by the corresponding $0.03 a watt. So, either it will come through as a higher ASP if we stay in an inflated environment that we're in right now or it's going to come through at a core cost per watt reduction. And I think sometimes people are dismissing the ASP as if the realization won't be captured, without understanding that what it drives to is the lower cost per watt. Either way, in my mind, it's going to add about $0.03 of gross margin across our capacity plans that are getting up to 15 or 16 gigawatts. So, there's a meaningful benefit one way or the other, either incremental ASP or lower CPW across, call it, 15 or 16 gigawatts production as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha with Guggenheim. Joseph Osha : Following up on that previous line of question, there's been lots of talk about the cost adders and the technology adders. But I'm wondering, is there any sort of apples-to-apples per watt cost reduction road map you can talk us through as the technology continues to advance? Because that's, I remember in the past, something you used to communicate about. Mark Widmar : So look, one of the things we did say is we're still on target for our cost per watt reduction exit rate is kind of target 4% to 6%. And so, we are taking out costs even in a very challenging inflationary environment this year. We have not given a continuation of that road map of further cost reductions, at least we haven't updated that for a period of time. But by definition, the cost per watt will decline as we improve the technology. So, as we continue to drive the efficiency higher, that's going to drive down our CPW. Plus we have other opportunities through our additional throughput initiatives, whether it's our bill of material reductions that we're working on as well. So, we will continue on a trajectory. If you wanted to assume just a rule of thumb modest kind of view of what we would expect over the next several years, I would believe that we should be still accomplishing at least single digits, maybe upper single digits cost reductions as we move forward. And as we've indicated previously, the Series 7 product will actually drive some cost reduction as well because of the design of that product with higher efficiency, improved throughput and other issues that will drive an improved cost profile. So, when you incorporate Series 7 into the fleet, you're going to see a benefit to the overall cost per watt. So, the cost per watt is not going to -- it's not peaked. It's going to continue to move in a positive direction. Assuming we don't go into some even crazier inflationary environment and we believe that we've largely protected ourselves on most of the exposure in that regard, but there could be some additional headwinds that we'd have to address in the future. But assuming a stable environment that we're in now and just the initiatives that we have in place, we should expect continued cost reduction on our module. Alex Bradley : Yes. And Joe, if you think about, as Mark said, a 4% to 6% cost per watt produced number this year, that's the decline. If you go back to the slides that we showed in our Q4 earnings and guidance call, back in end of February, early March, there's a chart in there that shows you the driver of the cost reduction. Those still hold true. If you look through where we have what's the modules, efficiency, throughput and yield, those key drivers to look at this. So, we haven't updated that chart from a new cost perspective, but the same drivers of cost per watt reduction still exist there. We also have on that chart bill of materials. As Mark mentioned, there are bill of material reductions that we would expect in ordinary course. However, we're in an inflationary environment, we also protected against some of the key drivers through the adjustors we have in our contracts. So that's another resource you can look to. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Been a lot of focus around the gross margins and the cadence here. So, I guess, I'll throw my question in the ring as well. The aluminum price, steel pricing environment, also freight, they've all sort of eased a bit recently per your earlier comments. When does it really start to impact the P&L and margins? I know you're talking about a 20% baseline for gross margin when things kind of normalize. And then on top of that, you get some of the tech adders that could take gross margins much higher. But as we think about, let's just say 2023, the cadence, it doesn't appear all of that is necessarily going to normalize. So, fair to assume we're going to see a pretty gradual margin cadence through the rest of this year and into most of next year? And then, with tech adders and some of the new capacity in India and Ohio, the real step-up starts to happen in '24. Just trying to get a sense for how we should budget expectations because there's a lot of moving parts there obviously over the next couple of years for the margin trajectory. Alex Bradley : Yes, Brian. So, we said that you're going to see the majority of the benefits come through in '24 onwards. You are going to see some benefit to 2023. If you look through the ASPs, we said those stay relatively flat across that horizon. From a cost per watt perspective, we said we're forecasting that cost per watt reduction this year. You're going to get the benefit of that next year, obviously. From a sales perspective, we do have some protection next year. It's still not every contract, and the amount of protection varies as we had some different flavors of contracts in the early days before we moved to effectively orders today, just a straight pass-through of excess risk to the customer. So you're going to see some incremental protection or benefit from sales freight next year, but really the big push on that you're going to see in 2024. From an adjustor perspective, we said before, the majority of the benefit that technology adjustors you're going to see being out in 2024 and beyond. And then from a commodity price basis, we said on the last call that we first started introducing the aluminum adjusted at that point, the majority of that was 2024 onwards. We've also recently started looking at steel as well for our Series 7 product, that will be 2024 onwards as well. So yes, you're going to see a little bit of benefit come through in 2023, but the majority of that's going to come through fully into 2024. You're also going to see the value of growth coming in mostly in 2024. But I would say that if you look at the timing expectation around our Perrysburg 3 factory, you will see some contribution from that and potentially a little bit from the India factory coming through in '23 as well. So, when you're doing your model, you'll get some benefit of growth coming through in 2023 as well. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch : Could you talk a little bit about the progress in Europe from a perspective of adding capacity and the volume demand? Certainly, there's a major need there. And the two-year time horizon that you've talked about in terms of the incremental capacity on from your vendors. But in terms of site selection, customers wanting to work with you, things like that, the preparations that you would see giving you the confidence to make those decisions. I'm just curious about an update there. Mark Widmar : Yes. So, one of the things we did highlight, if you look at our pipeline as well, I mean, the diversity of our pipeline, especially with near term as well as long-term opportunities in Europe, has grown significantly. I was actually over in Europe a few weeks ago and talking with a number of different customers. And there's a really significant demand and opportunity for partnering with First Solar, no different than what we've seen here in the U.S. and what we've seen in India. I mean, there's fatigue, and we referenced even a lawsuit, a very large litigation against one of the Tier 1 Chinese suppliers. They're fatigued by that, and they want to find someone who they can work with that ensures reliability and certainty. And obviously, there's a significant demand in the market, EU as they're trying to evolve off of their dependencies of Russian oil and gas, and they don't want to reposition that dependency then into another potentially adversarial country for their solar and climate change goals that they have. So, we're in deep discussions with a number of counterparties. They're trying to build an offtake agreement, and we're working through site selections already to try to figure out if we were to make a decision, what would be optimal. We do have cell sites in Eastern Germany. Obviously, the footprint isn't ideal for a Series 7 type product or 3.3 gigawatts of production. But look, we're also evaluating what is the right product for the European market. I mean could it be a combination of the utility scale or also could it be a smaller form factor, maybe a multi-junction tandem product for high-efficiency space constrained spaces. I mean it could be that's the right product to go to market in Europe. And then our Eastern Europe factory -- Eastern Germany factory looks a lot better to accommodate a footprint around that size. So, I would say I'm very encouraged. A lot of opportunity. I think it's a matter of just making the commitment and the contractual obligations and offtakes and being able to secure multiyear supply agreements to have -- provide a little more confidence we would like to have to enable manufacturing in the EU. I think it's pretty promising right now. We still would like to see some movement on the policy side a little bit. I think they're doing a number of positive things there, even including things like CO2 footprint requirements, restrictions as it relates to forced labor and some of the other challenges that we're also seeing in the U.S. trying to deal with their supply chains that are dependent upon Chinese production. So, a lot of good things happening in the EU, and it's a very important market for us, and we're looking at what's the best way to serve it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2022 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business and policy update. Alex will discuss our financial results for the quarter and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Earlier this afternoon, we announced net sales of $629 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.46 for the third quarter of 2022. As noted in our original guidance for the year, 2022 was projected to be challenging from an earnings standpoint, but we continue to maintain an unwavering focus on the future, setting the stage for long-term growth and profitability. Beginning on Slide 3. Our strong bookings momentum has continued into the second half of the year, with 16.6 gigawatts of new bookings since our last earnings call, which have a base ASP of $0.316 per watt before the application of potential adjusters and total year-to-date bookings of 43.7 gigawatts. Our total backlog of future deliveries now stands at a record 58.1 gigawatts and includes orders for delivery as far into the future as 2027. The continued long-term demand for our products and the fact that our technology is expected to serve as the backbone for many of our customers' long-term growth plans is a testament to First Solar's strong fundamentals, grounding our commitment to the principles of responsible solar, our differentiated technology platform, our balanced approach to growth, liquidity and profitability, and our ability to provide a U.S. technology and manufactured product. In the third quarter, our manufacturing facilities produced 2.4 gigawatts of modules, and we shipped 2.8 gigawatts. Although showing signs of the recent easing, the overall shipping and logistics environment remains challenging. Alex will later discuss the impact of this on our Q3 results and full year guidance. Manufacturing performance metrics remain consistent across our existing fleet, and construction of our third manufacturing facility in Ohio and our first manufacturing facility in India remains on schedule. During the quarter, we announced 4.4 gigawatts of additional U.S. manufacturing capacity. And today, we announced an additional investment into a dedicated R&D research facility to be located here in the U.S., near our existing manufacturing facility in Perrysburg, Ohio. Finally, as it relates to our legacy systems business, we have completed the previously disclosed sale of our operations and maintenance platform in Australia and Japan. And this week, we signed a sale and purchase agreement for our Luz del Norte project in Chile. Turning to Slide 4. With regards to our manufacturing capacity and as announced in August, we are investing approximately $1.2 billion in scaling our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Driven by robust demand for our module technology as well as U.S. manufactured product, we expect this will expand our domestic nameplate capacity to approximately 10.7 gigawatts in 2026, up to approximately $200 million will be spent to upgrade and expand our Ohio manufacturing footprint at both our current operating facilities as well as our third factory, which is currently under construction and scheduled to come online in the first half of 2023. As a result of this expansion, we believe our Ohio nameplate capacity will increase by almost 1 gigawatt to just over 7 gigawatts by 2025. Approximately $1 billion will be invested to build a new factory, our fourth in the United States, representing an additional 3.5 gigawatts of Series 7 nameplate capacity. This facility is expected to commence operation in 2025. We continue to evaluate several possible sites across the Southeast and expect to announce the location in the coming weeks. Beyond this, we continue to evaluate the opportunity for further investments in incremental manufacturing capacity, including throughput optimization of our current planned capacity. In addition, we are evaluating capital investments to support the advancement of our R&D initiatives. In the United States, the enhancement -- the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act with both supply side manufacturing and production tax incentives as well as demand drivers, including the expansion of investment and production tax credits for solar and clean hydrogen provides a long-term clarity necessary to support investments in manufacturing. In India, we continue to see a supportive policy environment given the decisive decisions by the government to diversify and grow domestic capabilities to avoid deeper dependencies on an unreliable, volatile and high-risk supply chain. In Europe, we continue to work with stakeholders to advocate for long-term manufacturing and supply chain strategies that would enable us to support the energy needs of Americas allies with local manufacturing, responsibly produced solar technology. We recently joined other leaders in the European Union to provide high -- to highlight the PV supply chain, the need for decisive actions from the EU if it wishes to deliver on its goal to scale manufacturing across the block by 2025. while our immediate focus on scaling our announced factories in the U.S. and India, we remain committed to exploring the long-term potential for further geographical diversification, contingent upon a supportive local policy and demand environment. With regard to research and development, today's announcement of an approximately $270 million investment will support a 1.3 million square foot dedicated R&D innovation center in Perrysburg, Ohio, which pending final approval of various state, regional and local incentives is expected to be completed in 2024. Currently, our R&D programs require transferring potential product advancements developed on specialized product development lines located in our California and Perrysburg laboratories to high-volume manufacturing conditions by running engineering test authorizations or ETAs, on our existing commercial production lines in Ohio. Using these production lines increases operational complexity as well as limit cycles of learning in addition, the combination of a larger form factor module, increased module throughput and a recently enhanced production-based policy incentives has significantly increased the opportunity cost of the downtime required to run ETAs on existing high-volume manufacturing lines. This new facility will feature a pilot manufacturing line allowing for the production of full-size prototypes of both thin film and tandem PV modules. Creating a sandbox separate from commercial manufacturing operations is expected to reduce operational complexity, reduce costs allow us to accelerate our rate of learnings, solidify our leadership in current and next-generation technologies. Turning to Slide 5. As previously mentioned, we booked 16.6 gigawatts since the July earnings call, bringing our year-to-date bookings to 43.7 gigawatts. With respect to future shipments, after accounting for shipments in the quarter of 2.8 gigawatts, which was in line with our expectations, our total contracted year-to-date backlog is 58.1 gigawatts. Note, while we have contracted volume for India, we have not recognized this volume in our backlog. Excluding our new India manufacturing facility, we are sold out for 2024 as of the July earnings call. As of now, we are sold out for 2025 and close to selling out for 2026. Note, we anticipate having '26 sold out by the end of the year as we have a number of contracts in late-stage negotiations. As we transact further into the future, we are pleased with the pricing trajectory of our technology. The 16.6 gigawatts of bookings since our prior earnings call in July have a base ASP, excluding adjusters where applicable of $0.316. Note, approximately 40% of this volume is reflected in the Q3 backlog number in the 10-Q. During the third quarter, certain amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufacturing products as well as commitments to supply Series 7 versus Series 6 modules increased our contracted revenue backlog by $52 million across 1.4 gigawatts or approximately $0.037 per watt. As of Q3, the average portfolio based ASP reflected in the revenue from contracted footnote in the 10-Q increased approximately $0.012 versus the second quarter end. As we previously addressed, a substantial portion of the overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through applications of adjusters if we're able to achieve certain achievements within our technology road map. As of the end of the third quarter, we have approximately 31.4 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which, if realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2024 and 2026. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards. In addition, this amount does not include potential adjustment for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Finally, this does not include potential price adjustments associated with the ITC domestic content provision under the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act. As a reminder, not every contract includes every adjuster described here. To the extent that such adjusters are not included in a contract, we believe the baseline ASP reflects an appropriate risk/reward profile. And while there can be no assurances that we will realize adjusters in those contracts where they are present, to the extent we are successful in doing so, we would expect a meaningful benefit to our current contracted backlog ASP. Our recent bookings, which include large headline numbers ranging from 0.7 to 2 gigawatts, including a number of significant transactions with existing customers, such as AREVA, Silicon Ranch and Swift Current Energy in the United States. The same is true where Azure Power, who has worked with First Solar for over a decade signed an agreement for 600 megawatts as the first customer to contract for offtake from our new facility in Chennai. Note, as mentioned during our prior earnings call in July, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As such, deals signed but not fully secured, included in this agreement with Azure Power will be reflected within the confirmed but not book portion of our pipeline graph in the earnings presentation. As reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust. Even at year-to-date bookings of 43.7 gigawatts, we retain total booking opportunities of 114 gigawatts. Our 71 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities include 62.5 gigawatts in North America, 4 gigawatts in India and 3.3 gigawatts in the EU. Even with our 16.6 gigawatts of bookings since our prior earnings call, our pipeline of mid- to late-stage opportunities has expanded by 52.8 gigawatts since the prior quarter. In addition to previously noted demand drivers, including customers' need for certainty around technology, supplier integrity and our ability to stay behind our contracts and deliver on our commitments, demand has been further catalyzed by the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act. For many customers, this legislation has provided visibility into supportive long-term policy environment to the extension of the solar investment tax credit, the introduction of the production tax credit for solar and similar incentives with respect to green hydrogen. As a consequence, we are seeing increased demand from both existing and potential new customers and included in our pipeline are several opportunities with multiyear, multi-gigawatt volumes. Turning to technology. We continue to make steady progress with our current road map as we worked on the operational and market readiness of our next-generation Series 7 modules. Our new Ohio facility, which will be the first in our fleet to produce this product, is on track to commission in the first half of 2023. Early test runs of the semiconductor deposition equipment performed as anticipated with full-size Series 7 samples delivering efficiency equivalent to the current modules [ph]. The Series 7 module has been developed in close collaboration with EPCs, structure and component providers, and the product has benefited from working over the past year with our partners, including Array Technologies and NEXTracker to develop mounting solutions. Their work, along with the support of our customers' EPC partners, is expected to help ensure the product ecosystem is ready and optimized for install costs once Series 7 enters the market. Additionally, we have continued to make progress advancing our CadTel bifacial modules based on our Series 6 platform and expect to launch a pilot production scale run before the end of this year and a small-scale infill deployment with a strategic customer as early as the first quarter of next year. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q3 2022 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 7, I'll cover the income statement highlights for the third quarter. Net sales in Q3 were $629 million, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior quarter. On a segment basis, our module segment net sales in Q3 was $620 million compared to $607 million in the prior quarter. . The increase in net sales was primarily driven by higher module volumes sold from our plants in Malaysia and Vietnam. Gross margin was 3% in Q3 compared to negative 4% in the prior quarter, primarily driven by the impairment of the Luz del Norte project in the prior quarter. Our Q3 module segment gross margin of 4% down from 5% in Q2 2022 was negatively impacted by two key [indiscernible] logistics items, partially offset by lower module costs and reductions to our warranty and module collection recycling liabilities. Firstly, with respect to sales rate, while spot rates have begun to ease significantly in recent weeks, higher sales rate charges under shipping contracts entered into at the beginning of the year continued to put pressure on our costs to deliver products during the quarter. Secondly, with respect to logistics, we experienced an unforeseen demurrage charge of approximately $30 million but what about this charge? Which is a discrete variable cost outside of the freight rate paid for transoceanic shipping. Demurrage charge are excess storage fees charged as a result of containers and modules remaining in port beyond a contractually agreed period. Whilst the shipping environment over the past 2 years has largely been characterized by container shortages and transit times well above prepandemic norms, the recent significant reversal in vessel waiting times and container turnaround times, though welcomed on a long-term basis if sustained has created near-term logistical challenges. In particular, during the third quarter, dramatically improved transoceanic transit times resulted in product delivered to port significantly ahead of both our expectations and contracted customer delivery dates, which drove a significant increase in demurrage charges as we waited for the customer site delivery window to open. Long term, we believe our strategy of increasing manufacturing capacity approximate to demand reduces the need for and risks associated with transoceanic shipping. In total, total sales rates and unforeseen logistical costs included in our cost of sales, reduced our module segment gross margin by 23 percentage points in Q3 compared to 16 percentage points in the prior quarter. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $76 million in the third quarter, an increase of approximately $12 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher share-based and incentive compensation and higher legal expenses. Production start-up, which is included in operating expenses totaled $20 million in the third quarter, an increase of $7 million compared to the prior quarter, driven by increased start-up costs associated with our third Ohio factory. Q3 operating loss was $68 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $67 million, production start-up expense totaling $20 million and share-based compensation of GBP 12 million, partially offset by a $6 million gain on the sale of our Australia and Japan operations and maintenance platforms. We recorded a tax benefit of $13 million in the third quarter compared to tax expense of $84 million in the prior quarter. Decrease in tax expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in our pretax income, certain losses in Chile in Q2 for which no tax benefit can be recorded. And in Q2, discrete expense related to the reevaluation of Vietnam deferred tax assets due to receipt for high-tech incentive certificate. Combination of aforementioned factors led to a Q3 loss per share of $0.46 compared to a Q2 earnings per share of $0.52 on a diluted basis. Next turn to Slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Cash flows generated from operations were $129 million and capital expenditures were $223 million in the third quarter. Our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash balance ended the quarter flat at $1.9 billion. Module segment operating cash flows and draws under our credit facility with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation for our India manufacturing plant were offset by other operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with our new Ohio and India factories. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $260 million, an increase of $85 million from the end of Q2 due to the first disbursement of the credit facility for our India manufacturing plant. $175 million of our outstanding debt is nonrecourse project debt and will come off the balance sheet upon the closing of the Luz del Norte project sale. Our net cash position, which includes cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities less debt, also ended the quarter flat at $1.7 billion. Turning on to Slide 9, I'll provide updated guidance. With regards to our legacy systems business and impacting our other business segment. In Q3, we completed the divestiture of our Japan business as the conditions precedent were met to close the sale of the O&M platform following on from the closing of the [indiscernible] platform in Q2. Additionally, this week, we signed a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of our Luz del Norte project in Chile, the closing of which we expect in Q4 of this year, subject to customary closing conditions. Full year financial impact of this sale are expected to be within the previously forecasted guidance ranges provided on the Q2 call in July. As it relates to our module segment, forecasted net sales is now $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, down $50 million at the midpoint of the range due to project timing shifts, which results in a full year average ASP slightly lower than previously forecast. In addition, approximately 200 megawatts of volume previously expected to be sold in the year is now expected to be recognized as revenue in 2023. Combined with our other segment revenue, consolidated full year net sales is forecast to be $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion compared to $2.55 billion to $2.8 billion previously. Q2 module segment gross margin guidance of $175 million to $215 million is updated to $125 million to $155 million, driven by 3 key items. Firstly, the impact of reduced revenue, driven by the aforementioned lower full year average ASP and volume sold. Secondly, the aforementioned unforeseen logistics costs estimated at $35 million, $30 million of which was reflected in Q3 results. And thirdly, our previously forecasted cost per watt produced reduction from year-end 2021 to year-end 2022 of 4.46% [ph] is updated to 3% to 5% largely as a function of unfavorable mix shift in production of high load versus stand-alone modules. Our cost per watt sold forecast previously seemed to be unchanged year-over-year is now forecast to increase approximately 2% from Q4 2021 to Q4 2022 as a function of this unfavorable mix shift in high versus stand-alone modules as well as an increase in the percentages of Q4 volumes sold coming from our higher cost Perrysburg facility relative to our previous forecast. These are partially offset by warranty and module collection recycling benefit of $18 million recognized in the third quarter. Combined with the other segment impact to gross margin forecast to be between negative $45 million and $50 million compared to negative $50 million to $60 million previously and which includes the impact from the Q2 impairment of the Luz del Norte project, total gross profit is forecast to be between $75 million and $110 million compared to between $115 million and $165 million previously. Within gross profit, the underutilization loss assumption of $10 million to $15 million remains unchanged. With the increase in demurrage charges, total sales rate and unforeseen logistics costs are now expected to impact gross margin by 19 to 21 percentage points compared to 18 to 20 points previously. Our forecast SG&A and R&D expenses of $270 million to $280 million remains unchanged. Forecast start-up expenses reduced from $85 million to $90 million to $80 million to $85 million. Therefore, our total operating expenses forecast is reduced from $350 million to $365 million to $345 million to $360 million. Operating income is estimated to be between negative $30 million and positive $20 million, down from previous guidance of positive $5 million to $70 million as a function of the above impact to net sales and gross margins. Other income and expense guidance of $25 million remains unchanged. Full year tax expense forecast increased from $55 million to $70 million to $65 million to $80 million due to a shift in jurisdictional mix of income partially offset by an increase in forecasted R&D credits. This results in full year 2022 earnings per diluted share guidance range of negative $0.65 to negative $0.35 compared to previous guidance of negative $0.25 to positive $0.25. Capital expenditures guidance is revised from $850 million to $1.1 billion to $800 million to $1 billion due to expected timing of purchase orders through the end of the year. Our year-end 2022 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.6 billion and $2 billion, an increase to the midpoint of $400 million primarily driven by increased module booking deposits and lower capital expenditures. And finally, shipment guidance of 8.9 to 9.4 gigawatts is updated to 9.1 to 9.4 gigawatts. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mark to provide an update on policy. Mark Widmar : All right. Thank you, Alex. I would like to discuss the U.S. policy environment, which has evolved significantly over the past quarter. As you may recall, the joint announcement from Senators Manchin and Schumer regarding the Inflation Reduction Act preceded in our last earnings call by just 1 day. Since then, we have seen the Act signed into law and First Solar had the privilege to be part of the White House event in September, celebrating the groundbreaking piece of legislation. . In our view, by passing and enacting the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Congress and the Biden-Harris administration has entrusted our industry with responsibility of enabling and securing America's clean energy future, and we recognize the need to meet the moment in a manner that is both timely and sustainable. Thanks to our strong foundation, including a repeatable, vertically integrated manufacturing template, proven technology platform and solid balance sheet, we were able to respond rapidly to enact -- to act by accelerating the decision to expand our U.S. manufacturing base. Our confidence in committing to a 1.5 billion expansion in American manufacturing and R&D was backed by a healthy order book, a robust pipeline of opportunities and approximately 2 decades of experience in scaling U.S. solar capacity. However, we still have a substantial journey ahead as the relevant U.S. government agencies work to implement the Act, providing interpretive guidance and alignment on process and administration. Specifically, we wait Department of Treasury guidance that will apply to what we believe is a legislation's intent to incentivize vertically integrated U.S. manufacturing under the Section 45X provision, allowing our thin film manufacturing process to access the entire integrated tax credit. Similarly, we also anticipate guidance on the domestic content bonus that project owners may seek under the new production tax credit and the extended investment tax credit for solar. Given our unique manufacturing process, which transforms raw materials into a finished module under 1 roof, we expect that our product will qualify as U.S. domestic content and help enable the bonus incentive. As a crucial first step towards delivering clarity the IRS has solicited comments from interested stakeholders that will then shape the guidance provided around aspects such as the administration and value of tax credits under the 45X provision. Moreover, while we understand the urgent need for clarity, we encourage a healthy degree of patience as the details are normalized. The effectiveness of this landmark climate legislation hinges on the thoroughness of this administrative process and resulting guidance. We strongly support the thorough, thoughtful approach being pursued by the Department of Treasury and IRS. As America's largest solar manufacturer, we remain actively engaged with the U.S. government and intend to respond to the public request for comment and provide input as an interested stakeholder to aid the guidance process. Internationally, we observed a strong growing focus from governments and democratic nations towards addressing the use of forced labor in the supply chain. In addition to the President said in U.S. we enforce Labor Protection Act, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have introduced measures to tackle the issue of businesses profiting from human rights abuses, particularly in China's Xingqiang region. More recently, the European Union released a draft law that could come into effect by 2025, which would ban the import of products linked to the use of forced labor regardless of where they are made. These actions point to the growing compliance risks of continuing to rely on Chinese crystalline silicon and the increasing urgency with which solar industries and democratic nations need to find sustainable solutions in response to the significant threat. Meanwhile, our responsible solar standard has not simply emerged as a key competitive differentiator has also been driving factors behind our industry-leading ESG ratings. We are proud that earlier this week, First Solar made its debut in Investor's Business Daily 100 Best ESG companies of 2022, ranking 6 across all included corporations and first among energy companies. Being the only solar manufacturer included in this list of leading companies that makes profitability with ethical and social responsibility is a testament to our commitment to responsible solar and attribute to the sense of purpose with which thousands of our employees around the world make the most of each day. With that, I conclude our summary on policy deployment. Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call. Alex Bradley : Turning to Slide 10. We had a Q3 loss of share of $0.46 and updated our earnings guidance, including for the impact of unforeseen logistics costs. We raised our year-end net cash forecast midpoint by $400 million to reflect higher module bookings prepayments as well as lower forecast CapEx. Operationally, we produced 2.4 gigawatts and shipped 2.8 gigawatts of modules. In addition to our recently announced 3.5 gigawatt U.S. greenfield plant, we today announced a $270 million investment in a new dedicated R&D line to be located at our Perrysburg, Ohio campus. Finally, Series 6 demand remains robust with 43.7 gigawatts of year-to-date net bookings, leading to a record contracted backlog of 58.1 gigawatts. The 16.6 gigawatts of new bookings since our prior earnings call in July have a base ASP, excluding adjusters, of $0.316. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kashy Harrison at Piper Sandler. Kashy Harrison : So just going to -- I'm just going to combine a bunch in here. So you indicated that some of the contracts that you signed recently have adders associated with the higher ITC. I was wondering if you could help us quantify how much revenue upside you may expect entering calendar '23 and '24 as we think about those years? And then maybe just some color on how you\u2019re thinking about financing all these investments, the $1.5 billion that you\u2019ve talked about. And then finally, maybe just some color on how you expect to recognize these credits within your financial statements in the coming years. . Mark Widmar : All right. I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Alex do the finance and then how we expect to recognize the credits in the P&L. So our contracts have and we've been doing this for an extended period of time now in corporate provisions that relate to domestic content to the extent there was any legislation that would be passed that would differentiate domestic content value for incremental ITC or even out with the PTC. So we've incorporated those matters. What I\u2019ll say from my prepared remarks is one of the things that we highlighted is that, we recognized as part of our backlog that has already been contracted as of the end of last quarter for about 1.4 gigawatts, we have modified those contracts, which would include value now for domestic manufacturing and it was $52 million against that 1.4. And in my prepared remarks, I indicated it was about $0.037. So there\u2019s a significant uplift what\u2019s been contracted so far is we\u2019d be recognizing across \u201823 and \u201824, but we have a lot more volume that we have to go out and contract. But I think it\u2019s an encouraging first step to have 1.4 now contracted at a pretty nice increase to our baseline ASP. Alex Bradley : Yes. Kashy. On the -- I'll do the credit first as a quicker answer. We would expect it to be in the statement of a reduction to cost of sales. So you'll see it hit gross margin and then flow through the P&L from there. From a financing liquidity perspective, you start with where we are today, we're forecasting ending in the year at about $1.8 billion of net cash. That's the midpoint of the guide. At that point, we'll have about $200 million of debt associated with our India plant, the assumption being that Luz del Norte project and the debt associated with that is sold by the end of the year. So that's about $2 billion gross cash, $1.8 billion net at the midpoint. If you think about use of that capital, by the end of the year, we'll have spent substantially all of the CapEx associated with our third Perrysburg factory, which is nearing the end of construction. We'll have double-digit millions [ph] remaining there, but the majority of that CapEx will be spent. As it relates to the India CapEx, we'll have 2% to 3%, maybe slightly higher, 400 remaining by the end of the year. The majority of what's left there will be covered by debt draws against the facility. So the limited impact to net cash there. So you can think about between those what will be effectively through that CapEx spend or have debt associated with that CapEx spend by the end of the year. We've recently committed to about $1.5 billion of spend. So that's $200 million to expand Ohio, about $1 billion for our fourth plant in the U.S. and just under $300 million for an R&D line. That $1.5 billion will get spent over 2023 and 2024, potentially a small amount into 2025. If you think about sources for that, we've recently been getting significant prepayments to module sales. So we've been working with customers who are helping to provide capital to finance the expansions that we're undergoing. If you look at that, we had about $150 million of module prepayments come in Q3. And if you look at the balance sheet as of the end of Q3, we've got just a little under $600 million of module prepayments on balance sheet at that point. The high point of the guidance assumes another 400 or so coming through by year-end. We have signed bookings, as you can see on -- in the bookings table in the presentation of about just under 10 gigawatts from the end of the quarter, so that deposits associated with those are not reflected in the queue. We also have significant additional contracts that we're in late-stage discussions on, which would add more down payments. So I think there's opportunity to increase the down payment number as well. Beyond that, if you think about other sources of cash, we've got non-booking deposit module business, operating cash flow over the next couple of years, which we haven't guided to, but which will be significant. And that's all before you look at any of the proceeds coming from the Section 45X impact under the IRA. So if you think about it today, we can finance the currently announced growth through a combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow. However, if you look beyond that, I do think we are continuing to evaluate opportunities to deploy more capital accretively, be that through the potential for additional manufacturing facilities, expanding at our existing facilities, putting more money into R&D potentially helping develop suppliers along the supply chain, and then there will also be some maintenance CapEx and other upgrades. So as I said today, we can finance the current growth with the combination of cash on hand and operating cash flow. If we do look at spending additional capital, we may get to a point where we either need or would like to go out and raise money. We'll give a view around that when we give guidance for next year in February. At that point, we'll look at more of a comprehensive view of capital and funding needs and services need to raise capital. If we do, I suspect today would be viewed more as bridge capital given that we expect to see a significant inflow of cash from the Section 45X. And therefore, what we need most likely as a bridge to those proceeds. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out anything at this stage, including the potential for equity or equity-linked capital as well. Operator : We'll move next to Philip Shen at ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : First one is on bookings. You've had a really nice bookings run for the past couple of quarters. It looks like Q4 should be strong. I was wondering if you might be able to quantify what that might be? And then also for Q1 and Q2, would you expect things to slow down then? Or do you think the bookings could continue? And it's ultimately the goal to potentially even book at through the end of the decade, perhaps, even over the next year. As it relates to the module cost structure, if solar, given this new FEMA building requirements that is up for a vote, if solar is required to build at risk category 4 versus now, which is risk category 1. And I know [indiscernible] fighting for risk Category 2, how much more cost would that bring to your cost structure if we need to go to Category 4. My understanding is to hit Category 2, there's no increase in your cost structure, but to get the category 4, is it $0.01 or $0.02 or potentially more? And then finally, from a housekeeping standpoint for Q3, can you share how many gigawatts were shipped that were recognized in revenue? Mark Widmar : All right, Phil, I'll take the first 2 and I'll let Alex take the last one. First off, Phil, as you can see what we announced in our presentation deck that if you look at our total pipeline of opportunities and then you look at our mid to late-stage opportunities, as I said in my prepared remarks, the 114 gigawatts of total opportunities and mid- to late stage is around 70 gigawatts, which both of those are record highs for us and meaningful opportunities for us to continue to see strong bookings momentum. I think this is the fourth quarter in a row that I think we've had double-digit bookings. So if you go back and if you look, starting with end of last year, Q4 of last year, we've had 4 quarters now with double-digit bookings. And this quarter here, at 16.6 [ph] is now an all-time record. When I look at near term, and I indicated, we'll sell through 2026 by the end of the year. And when -- and I also indicated we have a number of multi-gigawatt multiyear opportunities that are still in our pipeline. And we are seeing customers that are wanting to commit through the end of this decade. And we indicated in the prepared remarks, most of the bookings that we've seen right now are through 2027. And so now we're seeing longer-dated opportunities and again, multi gigawatts, which would be a historic record high individual bookings transactions that for us as a company. And I think where we sat before, our highest bookings we did before, I think it was somewhere in the range of about 5.4, 5.5, something like that with an individual counterparty. We've got multiple opportunities that would be significantly higher than that if we were able to close on those. And so I don't see the momentum changing at this point in time. And we will continue to book as long as we see strong ASPs, as we indicated in this last quarter, the bookings were $0.316 before adders. And if we can continue to see very strong ASPs going further out into the future, they have a very balanced risk/reward profile then we'll continue to do that. It also will continue to inform as we see that activity, and we'll continue to inform our views around additional factory expansions. We indicated our most recent expansion, which would come online in 2025. And there's still a window to impact the second half of this decade with more factories here in the U.S. And so as we see stronger demand, that will inform our views around incremental capacity expansions. Phil, your next question -- as it relates to the FEMA requirement and the Category 4, we're very well of what's going on there. What I would say is that if there is a Category 4 requirement for the power plant, it is not uniquely defined at an individual component level. Our products with our contracts are to deliver against a specification and the specification is defined in those agreements. To the extent that there is a decision made that ultimately individual components would need to be modified to enable a power plant to meet a certain criteria, a different category than what exists today then that would be a modification to the contract because the specification requirements for the product would change. So that is something that could evolve and we'll address that to the extent that it does. The other thing that I would say, I don't believe that the changes in order to hit the requirement of a Category 4 would necessarily be achieved by modifying or changing the module. I think more of it will come from the structure than it will come from the module. And there are certain things potentially you could do with the module as it relates to changing the frame or potentially the acryls or modify the thickness of the glass. All that is going to do is add weight to the product, which also creates challenges around install. These modules with the labor 2-men or 3-men lift, there are some limitations around weight. So I don\u2019t know if your optimal solution will be modifying the module, I think it could be more or less a modification to the structure that could handle the incremental requirements in our Category 4 Alex Bradley : And Phil, just to your last question. So we produced 2.4. We shipped 2.8 gigawatts on a sole basis, it's about 2.25. So 2.25. If you look at that against 620 revenue, it implies about a $0.275 [ph] ASP recognized. Operator : We'll take our next question from Colin Rusch at Oppenheimer & Company. Colin Rusch : Could you talk a little bit about the maturity of your process around the heterojunction process and products that you guys are looking at coming to market with -- and then as well with the price increases that you\u2019ve been able to push through, is any of that price increase related to the manufacturing tax credit at all? Mark Widmar : Yes. So Colin, I think you're talking about our multi-junction product that we've announced our development around, which we also referred to as Tandem. Look, as it relates to the technology, we've made significant advancements in that regard in terms of the capabilities and improving and delivering high-efficiency products along the lines of the road map that we've envisioned so far. And ultimately, we'd love to get to a point where we're sitting at 24%, 25% type of efficiency at the module level. The biggest issue that we still have around -- I think we made good progress in the lab. The real question is ultimately, how do we commercialize and when do we come to market. And one of the challenges that we've had in that regard is finding the right silicon supply chain, one that meets the criteria that are aligned with our approach around responsible solar. So, I think the technology is evolving quickly. The real question is, how quickly can we bring it to market? And how quickly can we get confidence in that supply chain that we would have to be dependent upon for the bottom sell, which at least the current vision is top cell thin-film CadTel, bottom cell crystalline silicon. Over time, we could look to evolve that to a thin-fin film construct, but that would be further out into the horizon. As it relates to pricing, again, what we said in the prepared remarks was that we are just in the process of realizing domestic content value that has been embedded in our base contracts. So we\u2019ve contracted 1.4 gigawatts. If you look at \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825, we have just on a capacity -- nameplate capacity perspective, we\u2019ve got north of 20 gigawatts of volume that will be available on a nameplate capacity will be slightly lower than that when you think about actually realization of capacity given the overall ramp of the new factories. But there\u2019s a lot of volume still to go through. We\u2019re happy to see the uplift, which is right now a little bit -- it\u2019s about $0.37 or so of value. So we did 1.4 gigawatts and $52 million of ASP value creation. So a lot of opportunities still go after the balance [ph]. We're just still in the early innings, and we\u2019ll continue to provide updates as we progress. Operator : We'll go to our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Congratulations team again. Well done, I got to say. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of pieces. You talked about capital allocation on brief. Can you talk about just expansion, right? You alluded to Europe as being an opportunity. Clearly, they have their own mandates or preliminary mandates in \u201825. Can you talk about that? Also, I\u2019ll note that the European bookings opportunity is a little bit modest\u2026 Mark Widmar : Julien, we lost you. All right. I'll -- look, I think the question was around further expansion. And we are continuing to evaluate expansion, whether in the U.S. or outside of the U.S. We think we're very well positioned in both the U.S. and India. We're happy with the progress we're making with our new factory in India. We're happy with the interest in our technology and the building up of our pipeline and very happy with the fact that we are now starting to contract for that volume off of that factory. And we're looking at multiyear agreements in India as well. U.S., the momentum is strong, the pipeline is very robust. And it's a matter of continuing to see that fill up. And then as we do, we'll inform our views on incremental capacity. EU for right now, we still would like to see better clarity around policy. And as I indicated, we, among others, that are involved in the EU from a manufacturing standpoint or supporting the market have written a letter or signed a letter that would hopefully encourage you to provide clarity around long-term stability of policy that would ensure -- enable an environment that is constructive to investments that we would need to make in the EU to support their long-term PV goals and climate change goals. So a lot going on, a lot of opportunity. It\u2019s just a matter of prioritization, and we\u2019re happy to see -- we\u2019re happy that we have options that we can consider. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Lee at Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Apologies in advance, I'm going to ask about pricing again. I know there's been a lot on the call about that. But a couple of quarters in a row now where base ASPs for out-year bookings are increasing. I mean, it sounds like based on your commentary, Mark, you still have upside levers, not talking about the adders just on the base ASPs across portfolio bookings going forward. So just curious if that\u2019s the right read across here. And then how we should be thinking just in general around trends you\u2019re seeing for I would assume U.S. capacity versus Malaysia and Vietnam capacity or getting priced differently going forward? And then my follow-up would be just with all the capacity you\u2019re building and some of the commentary coming from some of your peers, clearly encouraging that we\u2019re seeing some onshoring of the supply chain here. But how are you thinking kind of longer term, back half of this decade, you guys have always been a bit more prudent about adding capacity when others are maybe a bit more irrational or have been. Like what do you think about the landscape of new players coming in into the U.S.? And then what the implications for your kind of longer, longer-term field strategy? And then maybe ASPs would be if you think about kind of beyond the next 3-plus years? Mark Widmar : Yes. So in terms of base ASPs and opportunities, yes, we clearly are seeing an opportunity there as it relates to what was already contracted as of our last quarterly filing and as of the end of June. As indicated, we have provisions in our contracts. And in some cases, even if provisions are not in our contract, customers are reaching out to us and asking for an opportunity to get U.S. supply, which will enable their value creation on domestic content. And then we have a discussion with them. And appropriately adjust -- amend the contracts or the incremental ASP value, we think, is appropriate for dedicating that that allocation to a particular customer. So that's momentum, and we'll continue to see how it progresses. Like I said, we're in very early innings, but we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to pursue. As it relates to U.S. capacity versus Malaysia, Vietnam, as of now, as we see the horizon sold through 2026 by the end of this year, I see all that volume in Malaysia, India -- excuse me, Malaysia, Vietnam has been committed and sold as part of that overall volume. And we are distinguishing ASPs in a meaningful way for that volume and nowhere near -- it will be substantiated by the difference in the relative cost structure between Malaysia and the U.S. on a landed cost basis. So we are seeing some of that, but it's not -- so far it has not been material. And we'll continue to evaluate it as we move forward to ensure that we can sell through that capacity. And if we find that it's difficult to sell it into the U.S., we'll look to sell and support other markets internationally, such as EU from our Malaysia, Vietnam facilities over time. Look, we know that new capacity is going to come into the market. We believe we're an advantaged established player. We've got a unique initiated technology. We're the partner of choice with a number of key customers here in the U.S. We also firmly believe that CapEx is going to be higher to bring production into the U.S. and the cost is going to be higher to manufacture here in the U.S. Our Series 7 product is a low-cost product relative to Series 6 relative to Series 6 in Ohio, but also relative and competitive with our international factories for Series 6. So we believe we've got a differentiated technology, a low-cost technology. And we also believe that competition to put manufacturing here in the U.S., whether it's at the module level, the cell level or down to the wafer level, that will be a higher cost of product that we still believe we can differentiate ourselves and maintain attractive ASPs even if that were to happen. Operator : We'll take our next question from Maheep Mandloi at Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi : Maybe just one question on the contracted backlog. Can you talk about how many of contracts at manufacturing PTC or the domestic content ITC pass-through build-in? And so trying to think how much of that 0.18 [ph] per watt flows through the bottom line? And how much could we expect to be shared with the end customers? And separately, I just wanted to understand more on the R&D line investment. What could we expect over there? It seems like it's like a 1 gigawatt spare capacity, but I just want to understand what new upgrades or changes and mix like that. Alex Bradley : Yes, Maheep. On the backlog, we do not have any contracts where we are passing through or sharing the Section 45 production manufacturing tax credit. So let\u2019s be clear, that\u2019s all staying with us as we continue to build manufacturing and develop, we\u2019re going to use the proceeds on that credit to continue to expand both manufacturing and development and R&D here, but we\u2019re not sharing that credit with our customers under these contracts. Mark Widmar : As it relates to the R&D line, look, as I indicated, it's a 1.3 million square foot facility. We envision that, that line will probably start as it relates to ETAs. We may not run it 24/7. We may run it 5 days a week kind of thing, may not run again 24 hours. We're probably going to be doing something in the range of 1,000, maybe 1,200 plates a day for engineering tests. So it has capacity. Obviously, you can do much more than that but it's more or less as needed given the development requirements that we have for various programs, both on our thin film as well as our multi-junction tandem and we'll utilize it as well over time to even think about next-generation technology, whether it's perovskites or some other thin films that could evolve over time. So we're excited about having the R&D line. It decouples us from being constrained by our manufacturing capacity. It's going to improve our cycles of learning, and we really believe it will accelerate our technology road map and time to market. Operator : We'll go next to Keith Stanley at Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : Just one clarifying question on Slide 4. The year-end nameplate capacity it looks higher for the new Series 7 plants than the slide you showed earlier in the year for Ohio and India. What's driving that? Are they a little ahead of schedule or anything else going on? Mark Widmar : It relates to -- when we announced the $1.2 billion investment in about 4.4 gigawatts [ph] of capacity, we did that I believe it was August, we indicated we were driving incremental throughput through our existing footprint. So we -- the factory was initially backed in to do about 16,000 to about 16,500 models a day. Now we've taken it up to 17,000 modules a day. So by that incremental throughput, we're getting more capacity out of the new factories. Plus, we\u2019ve also optimized across the existing footprint of Perrysburg I and Perrysburg II, which will drive more throughput. So a combination of those two gives you almost a full gigawatt of incremental capacity. But it\u2019s for the new factories, and we are evaluating doing that for India as well. So we may pull another couple of hundred megawatts out of India based off of the throughput improvements and capital that we would deploy there. So it\u2019s really driven by that, just incremental throughput through the factories with a little bit of capital to make sure that it happens. Operator : And we'll take our final question today from Joseph Osha at Guggenheim Partners. Joseph Osha : Three quick questions for you. First, I'm wondering -- I know it's hard to comment. Do you know much about what the cash timing of 45X benefits might be versus when you book them? I'm curious about that. I'll just do all 3. The second question is looking at your tandem cell technology. I'm curious, is that more aimed at some of what you're looking at doing at rooftop or might we see that deploy in utility scale. And then third and finally, could we see you, given the magnitude of this U.S. footprint expansion, maybe think about starting to export some of that product? That\u2019s -- those are my questions. Alex Bradley : Yes. So on the cash timing, it's something that's going to come, I think, with more clarity when we get IRS treasury guidance. Typically, at the end of the year, we would file a tax return, 6 to 9 months after the year-end, and then there will be some time after that for us to receive cash. We're still -- it's still not clear exactly what process that will go through. So we're awaiting guidance to understand that more. Mark Widmar : Yes. And then as it relates to our tandem product, the initial targeted market is going to be rooftop residential, largely through -- we've talked before about a partnership with SunPower. So that's largely the channel market and initially a rooftop. But the expectation will be over time as we continue to drive cost out of the product, optimize it more to a utility scale application versus a rooftop application that we'll be able to make that transition from our target -- initial target market of rooftop into utility scale. And then as it relates to exports, there\u2019s clearly an opportunity to export even if there\u2019s a point -- I know there\u2019s a question I think Bryan may have asked earlier about the excess capacity in the U.S. market. We have the capability at the right time if need be to export into international markets [indiscernible] ourselves to the full benefit and the full integrated benefit under the manufacturing tax credit. So it\u2019s something to be evaluated. But what I would say is near term, look, when you look at our pipeline, gross pipeline of 115 gigawatts, 114 gigawatts, excuse me, there\u2019s more than ample opportunity here in the U.S., as you can see by that pipeline that the vast majority of that sits in the U.S. And so that\u2019s our primary market that we\u2019ll be focused on for the near term. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results as well as its guidance for 2023. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business update, Alex will then discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Following these remarks, Mark will provide a business and strategy outlook. Alex will then discuss our financial guidance for 2023. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. We began 2022 with the expectation that it would be challenging from an earnings perspective as we face unprecedented logistics and commodity costs. But we also expected it to be a year of transition, setting the stage for growth and profitability into 2023 and beyond. We entered this year in a significantly stronger commercial, operational and financial position with increased R&D investment, new domestic and international capacity coming online and a new Series 7 product. We also began the year with a record contracted backlog, a significant pipeline of bookings opportunity and a robust demand in our core markets. This momentum is driven by our points of differentiation, including a unique CadTel technology, vertically integrated manufacturing process, domestic production, strong balance sheet and commitment to responsible solar, placing us in a position to respond to emerging opportunities, particularly those enabled by the rapidly evolving policy environment. This momentum is also due to the hard work, commitment and passion of our associates. Beginning on Slide 3, I will highlight some of our key 2022 accomplishments. From a commercial perspective, in 2022, we saw a precipitous shift towards long-term, multiyear module procurement. This record volume of multi-gigawatt deals spanning multiple years was driven by a combination of competitive pricing, competitive technology, agile contracting, shared values and trust in our ability to deliver the certainty that our customers are looking for. As a result, we had an excellent year from a bookings perspective, securing a record 48.3 gigawatts of net bookings in 2022. This was an increase of 30.8 gigawatts from our prior annual record of 17.5 gigawatts set in 2021. Our total backlog of future deliveries as of today's earnings call now stands at a record 67.7 gigawatts. Financially, while Alex will provide a more comprehensive overview of our 2022 financial results, our full year EPS results came in towards the high end of the guidance range we provided at the time of our third quarter earnings call. We ended the year with a gross cash of $2.6 billion, or $2.4 billion net of debt, which is an increase to gross and net cash of $800 million versus the prior year. This puts us in a position of strength to expand our capacity, invest in research and development and technology improvements and pursue our strategic opportunities. From a manufacturing perspective, we produced a record 9.1 gigawatts in 2022. Additionally, at the start of 2023, we achieved a significant milestone, producing our 50th gigawatts since commercial production began in 2002. Average watts per module produced in 2022 increased to 462 watts, an increase of 14 watts, and we increased our top production bin from 465 watts in 2021 to 475 watts in 2022. We exited 2022 with 9.8 gigawatts of nameplate manufacturing capacity and, last month, commenced initial production at our next-generation Series 7 factory in Ohio, which will continue to ramp through 2023. We are also on track to complete the construction and commence the ramp of our Series 7 factory in India during 2023. Furthering our manufacturing expansion program, in 2022, we announced a new 3.5-gigawatt Series 7 factory in Alabama and a 0.9-gigawatt increase to nameplate capacity at our Ohio factories. By 2026, we expect U.S. nameplate capacity of approximately 10.7 gigawatts and global nameplate capacity of approximately 21.4 gigawatts. We also announced in 2022 an additional investment and a dedicated $270 million research and development facility to be located near our existing Perrysburg manufacturing plant in Ohio. We expect that this investment will improve cycles of learning and innovation and reduce downtime on our commercial production lines, while allowing us to produce full-sized prototypes of both thin film and tandem PV modules. Strategically, we were able to largely exit our legacy systems business in 2022, which enables us to focus on our greatest technology and competitive advantages. Alex will discuss potential remaining legacy costs and opportunities related to this business when he provides guidance later in the call. Looking forward, we continue to evaluate the opportunities for further investments in incremental manufacturing capacity, including both greenfield expansion and throughput optimization at our currently planned capacity. This evaluation will require, among other things, an understanding of the anticipated IRS and treasury IRA guidelines, including the respect to domestic content as well as confidence in the presence of robust supply chain that supports our expansion objectives. Therefore, no expansion decisions have been made at this time. Turning to Slide 4. I'll next discuss our most recent shipments and bookings in greater detail. We shipped approximately 2.3 gigawatts and 9.3 gigawatts for the fourth quarter and full year 2022, respectively, which was within the guidance range that we provided during the third quarter earnings call. As a reminder, we generally define shipments as when the delivery process to a customer commences, whereas revenue recognition, or volumes sold, occurs at a transfer of control of the modules to the customer, which is commonly upon arrival at destination port or project site. With regards to bookings, we have sustained our recent momentum with 12 gigawatts of net bookings since the third quarter earnings call at an average base ASP of $0.308 per watt. As previously noted, we are seeing a perceptible shift in procurement behavior as evidenced by the volume of multiyear, multi-gigawatt orders placed by our customers. Since the beginning of 2022, large developers such as Intersect Power, Lightsource BP, National Grid, Origis Energy, Savion, Silicon Ranch and Swift Current, among others, have placed orders for at least 2 gigawatts. The fact that many of these transactions are with repeat buyers is an indication of the trust and shared values that underpin our customer relations. And it is a clear differentiator from the most more transactional approach taken by many of our competitors. After accounting for shipments of approximately 2.3 gigawatts during the fourth quarter, our future expected shipments, which now extend into 2029, are 67.7 gigawatts. Excluding India, and including our year-to-date bookings, we are sold out through 2025. We have, in recent months, pivoted from negotiating solely for 2026 volume to work with customers who are looking to secure multiyear contracts over the remainder of the decade. As a result of this commercial shift, we have not, as previously expected, as of the third quarter earnings call, fully sold out of our non-India production in 2026. We have sold more volume than previously expected for deliveries in 2027 and beyond. In total, we now have 25.5 gigawatts of planned deliveries in 2026 and beyond, an increase of 12.3 gigawatts from our prior earnings call. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full year 2022 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 5, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion compared to the prior quarter. Our module segment net sales were $846 million, an increase of $226 million from the prior period. The increase in module revenue is driven by higher volumes sold, partially offset by a slight reduction in ASPs. The remaining increase in our net sales was attributable to the completion of the sale of our Luz del Norte project in Chile. For the full year 2022, net sales were $2.6 billion compared to $2.9 billion in the prior year. This decrease was driven by $0.4 billion of lower revenue from our residual business operations due to the divestitures of our project development businesses in the United States and Japan, along with the divestitures of our North American and international O&M businesses. The decrease in our Other segment revenue was partially offset by a $0.1 billion increase in our module segment revenue due to higher volumes of modules sold, partially offset by a reduction in ASPs. Gross margin was 6% in the fourth quarter compared to 3% in the third quarter, primarily due to lower module and freight costs, partially offset by a reduction in ASP. For the full year 2022, gross margin was 3% compared to 25% in the prior year. The full year gross margin was negatively impacted by reductions in module ASPs, the sale of certain projects in the prior year, higher sales rate and demurrage charges and the net impairment in sale of our Luz del Norte project, partially offset by lower module costs. Sales rate in logistics costs adversely impacted our financial results, reducing gross margin by 19 percentage points in 2022 compared with 11 percentage points in 2021 and 6 percentage points in 2020. Given the recent decline in spot rates and the reversion of the shipping market towards pre-pandemic conditions, we expect sales rate and logistics charges to be less of a headwind in 2023. As a reminder, many of our module manufacturing peers report sales rate as a separate operating expense outside of gross margin. For comparison purposes, we encourage you to consider this factor when benchmarking our module gross margin percentage with our peers. SG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $107 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $11 million relative to the prior quarter. This increase was driven by a $13 million increase in production start-up expense, primarily related to the addition of our third factory in Ohio, which was partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense. Our fourth quarter operating loss was $46 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $71 million, production start-up expense of $33 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. Our full year 2022 operating loss were $27 million, which included depreciation and amortization of $270 million, production start-up expense of $73 million, net losses of $48 million associated with the sale of our Luz del Norte project and share-based compensation expense of $29 million, partially offset by a $254 million net gain from the sale of certain businesses. With regard to other income and expense in connection with the sale of our Luz del Norte project in the fourth quarter, the project's lenders agreed to forgive a portion of the outstanding loan balance, which resulted in a gain of $30 million recorded within other income. Separately, interest income in the fourth quarter was $18 million, an increase of $8 million compared to the prior quarter. And interest income for the full year 2022 was $33 million and leases to $27 million compared to the prior quarter. Both increases were driven by higher interest rates on our cash and marketable securities balances. We recorded an income tax expense of $1 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we recorded tax expense of $53 million, primarily attributable to the sale of our Japan project development platform and due to certain losses in Chile for which no tax benefit could be recorded. Fourth quarter loss per diluted share was $0.07, compared to $0.46 in the prior quarter. For the full year 2022, loss per diluted share was $0.41, compared to earnings per diluted share of $4.38 in 2021. Our 2022 EPS result came in above the mid-point of the guidance range that we provided during the third quarter earnings call. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. The aggregate balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of $0.7 billion from the prior quarter and $0.8 billion from the prior year. Our year-end net cash position, which includes the aforementioned balance less debt was $2.4 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion from the prior quarter and $0.8 billion from the prior year. The increases in our net cash balance were primarily driven by module segment operating cash flows, including higher advanced payments received for future module sales, partially offset by capital expenditures associated with our new plants under construction in the United States and India. Cash flows from operations were $873 million in 2022, compared to $238 million in 2021. Capital expenditures were $327 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $223 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $904 million in 2022, compared to $540 million in 2021. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Mark to provide a business and strategy update. Mark Widmar : All right. Thank you, Alex. Looking forward to 2023, we are pleased to enter the year with solid fundamentals, including a record backlog of orders and a manufacturing capacity growth plan that is well underway. We are on track to add 6.2 gigawatts of global nameplate manufacturing capacity this year as our new Series 7 factories come online in the U.S. and India. We expect to exit 2023 with 16 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity. We also expect 2023 to be a pivotal year as we build on the foundations established in 2022 to scale manufacturing, invest in R&D and evolve our technology and product road maps. In addition, we expect to begin benefiting from the advanced manufacturing production tax credits provided for under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act. We await IRS and Treasury guidance that we expect will reflect the statute\u2019s language and intend to incentivize the domestic production of modules and the related components. Given our fully integrated thin film manufacturing process, we expect that this guidance will entitle us to integrated tax credits for wafers, cells and module assembly, which we estimate will equal approximately $0.17 per watt for modules produced in the United States and sold to a third-party. Finally, we expect to host an Analyst Day event at our manufacturing facility in Ohio later this year, on a date to be announced, to deliver an overview of our technology, product and manufacturing road maps as well as to highlight our newest Ohio factory. Turning to Slide 7. As previously noted, our new Series 7 factories remain on schedule. The U.S. factory commenced initial production in January of 2023 and will continue to ramp over the remainder of 2023. Our India factory is forecast to begin production in the second half of 2023 and ramp into 2024. Once fully ramped, these factories are expected to lead the fleet in terms of module wattage and efficiency and regionally on a cost-per-watt basis. Based on our current technology road map, we see the potential for meaningful improvement in our module performance, with a mid-term goal of achieving a 570-watt monofacial Series 7 module. As we significantly increase our nameplate capacity, we believe this anticipated growth, when balanced with liquidity and profitability will drive earnings accretion as contribution margin expansion is leveraged against a largely fixed operating expense structure. As a reflection of this expansion road map and continued optimization of the existing fleet, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2023 to 2026 on this slide. Turning to Slide 8. Our total bookings opportunities of 93.1 gigawatts remain robust with 58 gigawatts in mid to late-stage customer engagement. When combined with our current record backlog of 67.7 gigawatts, we believe we are well-positioned for growth with a solid foundation of demand visibility. As it relates to converting the pipeline into future bookings, our record bookings in 2022 were driven by the favorable balance of near to mid-term available supply, aligned with customer demand for large volume multi-year procurement. The time line into which we are now selling is longer-dated than historic U.S. sales cycles. As a consequence, this could result in year-on-year reduction in bookings volume as we look to sell long-term forecasted supply in 2026 and beyond. Our commercial strategy remains largely focused on supporting long-term multi-year customers who prioritize price and product availability certainty as well as ethical and transparent supply chains. Furthermore, this demand environment supports the rationale of evaluating future capacity growth, subject to the aforementioned considerations related to expansion, including those related to IRA domestic content guidance and the assessment of our supply chain. Before turning the call back to Alex, I would like to take a brief moment to touch on the global policy environment. Broadly speaking, 2022 placed us on the cusp of significant growth in domestic solar manufacturing within our core markets. As policymakers here in the United States and leading democracies abroad demonstrates, they are serious about tackling the unhealthy overconcentration of solar supply chains in China and the vulnerabilities that come with it. In fact, 2022 saw industrial policy designed to spur investment and create jobs at scale. The year saw a tangible progress in the U.S. with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in India with the production-linked incentive program and movement towards spurring domestic manufacturing within the European Union with the introduction of the Green Deal industrial plan. Furthermore, we\u2019ve also seen a significant uptick in legislation focused on tackling the issue of forced labor with the passage of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in the United States and similar laws and initiatives, either implemented or under consideration, in Europe, the United Kingdom Australia and Japan. These significant recent and ongoing policy developments demonstrate that governments around the world are supportive of solar technologies that can be scaled in a sustainable manner for both people and the planet. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Alex, who will discuss our financial outlook and provide 2023 guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before discussing financial guidance, I\u2019d like to reiterate our approach to growth and gross margin expansion. As discussed on our second quarter earnings call, this strategy includes our approach of contracting out our capacity several years in advance of production. The anticipated reduction of our cost per watt produced, the expected benefits from capacity expansion through scaling a largely fixed overhead structure in order to generate incremental contribution margin and our agile contracting approach would both provides the potential realization of incremental revenue and is expected to mitigate freight and certain commodity risks. As we look to 2023 guidance, we continue to see this approach benefiting our forecasted financial results relative to 2022. For the full year, we expect to recognize an average ASP sold of $0.285 per watt, approximately $0.01 higher than in 2022. Looking across the horizon, as is showed in the 10-K filing, as of 31 December 2022, we had a total contracted backlog of 61.4 gigawatts with expected future revenue of $17.7 billion for a portfolio average base ASP of $0.288 per watt, before the application of potential adjusters. As it relates to cost award and our contracting approach and their impacts on both the potential value of the technology adjusters, which are reflected in the 10-K filing and our 2023 financial guidance, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the timing of our technology and cost road maps. From a technology road map perspective, we continue to work to prove out both bifaciality and our copper replacement or cure program and are progressing well with both initiatives. However, even if ready for high-volume manufacturing deployment, we expect to elect to push out implementation of these technologies across the majority of the fleet for two reasons. Firstly, technology implementations typically necessitate manufacturing downtime, both to make tooling and process changes and to conduct preproduction trials. And as we\u2019re sold out through 2025 with limited ability to delay shipments, significant downtime would be suboptimal to executing on our delivery commitments. Secondly, we typically roll out technology improvements at our Perrysburg facilities and then, once fully optimized, across the remainder of the fleet. This leads to a potential for greater downtime in Perrysburg during initial rollout, which has the highest opportunity cost given the anticipated value of domestically produced modules, both from an IRA domestic content and Section 45X perspective. Our new dedicated R&D facility, projected to be operational in mid-2024, is expected to alleviate the need for choosing between downtime and implementation by providing a means to optimize these technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines. With respect to the potential value of the adjusters related to potential future technology improvements, as reflected in the 10-K, the push out of these technology programs will result in a reduction in the supply of products with these technology improvements, leading to an expected reduction in technology adjusters, particularly in 2024 and early 2025. We have correspondingly reduced our estimate for these adjusters from $0.7 billion across 31.4 gigawatts in Q3 to $0.5 billion across 31.5 gigawatts in Q4. From a cost reduction road map perspective, as it relates to cost per watt produced, we ended Q4 2022 5% lower than Q4 of the previous year, at the midpoint of our original forecasted production range of 4% to 6%. This was used to throughput, yield and efficiency improvements and reductions in variable costs, slightly offset by increases in fixed costs. We\u2019ve been able to achieve a sustained cost per watt reduction road map over the last several years, having reduced our cost per watt produced by 18% from Q4 2019 to Q4 2022. On a full year 2022 to 2023 basis, we expect a 1% to 2% reduction in cost per watt produced, driven by improvements in throughput, yield, efficiency and inbound freight, partially offset by higher fixed costs and a headwind from the conversion of all production to high mechanical load modules in 2023 to optimize order fulfillment management and logistics. With regards to high versus standard mechanical load modules, we may reintroduce the stand-alone product in future years. And in doing so, we would expect to see a cost per watt benefit. As it relates to exit rates, comparing Q4 2022 to Q4 2023, we\u2019re forecasting a cost per watt produced increase of 4% to 6% or approximately $0.01 per watt. This is driven by several factors, including costs driven by the expected implementation of bifaciality at our lead line in Perrysburg in Q4 of 2023, which results in a reduction in front side watts, offset by a higher energy production profile; planned downtime associated with our Series 6 throughput optimization in Ohio; and a headwind associated with our Series 7 factory in Perrysburg, exiting its ramp phase in mid to late 2023, but not yet operating at full scale by year-end. As it relates to cost per watt sold, we ended Q4 2022 with a 2% year-over-year increase over Q4 2021, in line with our most recent forecast. This was largely due to higher sales freight and logistics costs. In 2023, we expect sales freight and logistics costs trend back towards pre-pandemic levels throughout the year. Several key metrics, including reliability of schedule, transit times and congestion are currently trending positively. However, transit time volatility generally and labor relations in West Coast ports post potential headwinds. We are working to mitigate these issues through shipping route and port-of-entry optimization and through further utilization of our warehousing network. In addition, as part of our contracting strategy, approximately 67% of our volumes sold in 2023 has some form of sales freight risk coverage. Although given the forecasted reduction in sales freight and logistics costs, we expect limited excess recovery in 2023. On a cents per watt basis, we expect our full year sales freight and logistics costs to be approximately $0.027 per watt, with international transit costs remaining above pre-pandemic norms. Taken together, we forecast cost per watt produced, ramp and underutilization and sales freight and logistics costs to combine to yield a Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 net reduction in cost per watt sold of 9% to 11% and full year 2022 to 2023 cost per watt sold reduction of 7% to 9%. On a full year basis, expected ramp and underutilization costs impact our cost per watt sold reduction by approximately 4 percentage points. With respect to other commodities, we continue to largely mitigate exposure to glass costs through strategic long-term, predominantly fixed price agreements with domestic suppliers that have economic benefits to us as we achieve high levels of production. We do expect the near-term volatility in glass pricing, given that the contractual provisions in our supply contracts relating to input cost adjustments operates on a backward-looking basis. And therefore, we are seeing a slight increase in cost in the first half of 2023, which is expected to then reduce in the second half of the year. From a frame perspective, there\u2019s been a reversion of aluminum and steel rates back to historical levels. We expect these costs to be less of a headwind in 2023. Related to framing costs, we have hedged 90% of our aluminum exposure for our Series 6 U.S. plants in 2023, which is approximately 1/3 of our Series 6 production. In addition, substantially all of our Series 7 production, which utilizes a steel back rail, is subject to contractual steel adjusters. And lastly, with respect to operating expenses, despite a forecasted increase in operating expenses in 2023, particularly related to research and development, we continue to scale manufacturing capacity at a greater rate than operating expenses, leveraging our fixed cost structure to reduce operating expense per watt and increase operating margin. So with this in mind, I\u2019ll next discuss [indiscernible] 2023 financial guidance. Please turn to Slide 9. Strategically, in 2022, we completed the sales of our Japan project development business, our Japan O&M business and our Chilean Luz del Norte asset. In January of this year, we completed the sale of our 10-megawatt Maricao operating asset in India, bringing our PV solar power systems balance on our balance sheet, as of today, to zero. With these sales, we have effectively transitioned back to a module-only company. We do have certain remaining risks, liabilities, indemnities, warranty obligations, accounts payable, accounts receivable, earn-outs, cash collection, dispute resolution and other legacy involvements related to our former systems business. Given the declining impact of our other segment, we will no longer provide segment-specific guidance, but shall in the future note any significant impact from the other segment to our consolidated financials. As it relates to capacity expansion, our factory expansion and upgrades remain on schedule and are expected to impact operating income by approximately $195 million to $220 million in 2023. This is comprised of start-up expenses of $85 million to $90 million primarily incurred in connection with our new factories in Ohio and India; an estimated ramping on the utilization costs of $110 million to $130 million. We anticipate these expansions and upgrades will contribute meaningfully to our production plans in 2024 and beyond. Operationally, in 2023, we\u2019re expecting to produce 11.5 to 12.2 gigawatts of modules, and after taking into account reductions in inventory, fell 11.8 to 12.3 gigawatts. From a capital structure perspective, our strong balance sheet has been and remains a strategic differentiator, enabling us both to weather periods of volatility as well as providing flexibility to pursue growth opportunities including self-funding our Series 6 and Series 7 transitions. We ended 2022 in a strong liquidity position. And coupled with strong forecasted operating cash flows, modular advance payments and our existing India credit facility, we expect to be able to finance our current capital programs without acquiring external financing. We are evaluating putting in place our revolving credit facility to support jurisdictional cash management as well as to provide short-term optionality and expect to address more details on our capital structure and liquidity outlook at our Analyst Day. And finally, a few words on the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA offers, amongst other incentives, production tax credits for solar modules and solar module components manufactured in the U.S. and sold to third parties. Although we continue to await guidance from the IRS and Treasury regarding these credits under Section 45X of the statute, based on our view of both the intention of the credit and the language of the legislation, we intend to begin recording a corresponding benefit in our financial statements in Q1 of 2023. Following consultation review with outside advisers, our auditors and the SEC, we expect to recognize these credits as a reduction to cost of sales in the period such modules and the integrated eligible components are sold to customers. In addition, these credits will also be shown as government grants receivable on our balance sheet. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today\u2019s press release and presentation for the risks related to our receiving the full amount of tax benefits that we believe we are entitled to under the IRA. I\u2019ll now cover the full year 2023 guidance ranges on Slide 10. Our net sales guidance is between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion; gross margin is expected to be between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, which includes $660 million to $710 million of advanced manufacturing production tax credits under Section 45X of the IRA; and $110 million to $130 million of ramp and underutilization costs. SG&A expense is expected to total $175 million to $185 million compared to $165 million in 2022 and $170 million in 2021. R&D expense is expected to total $155 million to $165 million compared to $113 million and $99 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The 2023 expense is increasing primarily due to our expectation of adding headcount to our R&D team to further invest in advanced research initiatives. SG&A and R&D expense combined is expected to total $330 million to $350 million. And total operating expenses, which includes $85 million to $90 million of production start-up expense, are expected to be between $415 million and $440 million. Operating income is expected to be between $745 million and $870 million, as inclusive of $195 million to $220 million of combined ramp and underutilization costs and plant startup expenses, and $660 million to $710 million of Section 45X credits. Turning to non-operating items. We expect interest income, interest expense and other income to net to $60 million to $75 million, which is predominantly driven by higher expected interest rates for deposits. Full year tax expense is forecast to be $60 million to $85 million. Tax expense to 2023 is largely driven by the U.S. blended tax rate of approximately 25%. However, we also expect a significant loss in the year as we begin manufacturing for which we will not receive a current benefit, leading to a higher effective tax rate. This results in a full year 2023 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $7 to $8. Note from an earnings cadence perspective, we anticipate our earnings profile will be higher in the second half of the year, both due to contractual delivery schedules as well as the timing of first sales of our Series 7 products, which are forecast to begin shipping in Q3 of this year. This is forecasted to result in an increase in inventory at our distribution centers in the first half of 2023, which is expected to reverse in the second half of the year. Additionally, Section 45X credits, recognized, will increase after Q1, driven by both the timing of volumes sold as well as the inventory lag, whereby products sold in the early part of 2023 may have been manufactured in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to range from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion as we complete the construction of our Ohio and India Series 7 plants, commence construction on our Alabama Series 7 plant, implement throughput upgrades to the fleet and invest in other R&D-related programs. Our year-end 2023 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The decrease from our 2022 year-end net cash balance is primarily due to capital expenditures, which we expect will be partially offset by financing proceeds and customer advance payments. Turning to Slide 11, I\u2019ll summarize the key messages from today\u2019s call. Demand has been robust, with 12 gigawatts of net bookings since the prior earnings call, leading to a record contracted backlog of 67.7 gigawatts. Our opportunity pipeline remains strong with a global opportunity set to 93.1 gigawatts, including mid- to late-stage opportunities of 58 gigawatts. On the supply side, we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and expect to exit 2026 with approximately 21.4 gigawatts of nameplate capacity, including approximately 10.7 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in the U.S. We are, as previously announced, adding a new dedicated R&D facility in Ohio, projected to be operational in mid-2024, which we believe will allow us to optimize technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lens. We ended the year with a gross cash balance of $2.6 billion or $2.4 billion net of debt, which is an increase to both gross and net cash of $800 million versus the prior year. We believe this puts us in a position of strength to expand our capacity, invest in research, development and technology improvements and pursue other strategic opportunities. And finally, we\u2019re forecasting full year 2023 earnings per diluted share of $7 to $8. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now we\u2019ll take a question from Philip Shen of ROTH. Philip Shen : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. First topic here is on bookings. Congrats on your Silicon Ranch light source deals. It looks like you had 7 gigawatts of incremental bookings in the quarter. Can you share what the pricing might look like? Is it incrementally higher or lower versus the last quarter? I think, from Q3, your incremental bookings were maybe $0.316 versus $0.301 per watt in Q2. And then how should we think about bookings momentum ahead? It sounds like you\u2019re expecting more multiyear agreements? And what do you expect on pricing there? And then shifting over to domestic content. I think in the last call, you guys talked about contracting 1.4 gigs of domestic content, I think in 2023, representing roughly $0.04 a watt of value. How much have you done since then? And how much of that is ultimately factored into guidance? And then finally, for a housekeeping question here. I think you shipped 2.4 gigawatts in Q4, but how many megawatts were recognized in revenue versus the $846 million of module revenue in Q4? Thanks very much. Mark Widmar : All right. On the bookings side, so we -- since our last earnings call, we booked 12 gigawatts, okay? Since year-end, we booked 7.3 gigawatts. If you look at our disclosure that\u2019s in the K, I think Alex referenced it as well, our contracted backlog revenue is a little less than $18 billion as of the end of the year, it\u2019s like $17.7 billion. The implied ASP on that is like $0.288. And if you do the math, the walk from the prior quarter, I mean, you\u2019ll get something around $0.31, I believe. If you\u2019d look, there\u2019s a lot of rounding and stuff that\u2019s going on in there. What we did say is that on the 12 gigawatts that we booked since the last earnings call, the ASP on that was $0.308. If I look at the ASP for what we booked in the first quarter this year so far, right, through the earnings call here today, that ASP is higher than that $0.308. So the average ASP that we booked for the $0.073 is higher than the five that we booked since the other portion of the total booking since the last earnings call. So ASPs are pretty \u2013 in a pretty solid position. I guess the other way I look at it is just from the Q3, 10Q to the 10K at the year end. I think we added about eight tenths of a cent or something to the average ASP. So you saw it, I think it was like $0.28 or something like that the prior quarter. Now it's like $0.288. And we're seeing a lot more bookings now, obviously higher than that. And if you were to include the bookings that we have for January and February, I think the \u2013 you add about $2.3 billion of revenue or something like that in the average ASP on that contracted backlog, I think goes to be slightly above $0.29. So we're very happy with what we're seeing from an ASP standpoint and obviously the trajectory. And remember, we're booking a lot more volume than is not just in 2026, which is what we said we were targeting from the last earnings call we were going to be booking into 2027 and 2028. We now have 47 gigawatts or so of 27 \u2013 24 gigawatts I think or so of volumes that go out into 2026, 2027 and 2028. It's about 45% of our capacity excluding India. So we're booking relatively far out all the way up through 2029, and we're getting, good ASPs with which, so we're pretty pleased with that. Momentum wise, Phil, I guess the challenges continue to be is finding customers that want to contract that far out in the horizon. And one of the things that we're trying to do instead of just sell each discrete year out, we're trying to sell out multiple years, right? So we're not just selling 2026, we're trying to bring in 2026, but bring in your 2027, 2028 or even 2029 volume into the discussions with the customer. So, we will see how that goes. I mean, the pipeline clearly says the momentum's there and there's opportunities we've got more than enough pipeline of opportunities that we could close on. So we're happy with that momentum. But again, it's changing kind of the normal cadence and the dynamics of bookings and in particularly in the U.S. most people wouldn't go out multiple years. But we are seeing a lot of customers that are willing to do that. And not only just out three or four years, but in some cases out five or six years. Domestic content, Alex may have a more precise number than I do. I know, we ended up booking a little bit of incremental volume from the last earnings call. It wasn't a significant amount of the few 100 megawatts. But the ASP uplift that we're getting there is still in that range of around $0.03 to $0.04. So we are seeing good momentum there. And we're out aggressively talking 2024 and 2025 right now with customers to get incremental ASP uplift for domestic production that we would provide our customers. So that's an ongoing activity from that standpoint. And Alex may have the actual gigawatts from a revenue standpoint. Alex Bradley : Yes. So Q4 we shipped 2.3, but from a solar volume it was 3.2. So that takes full year numbers. So 2022, we ended up shipping about 9.2 from a [indiscernible] perspective, 8.9, yes. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Hey guys. Good afternoon. Kudos on the quarter and the strong guidance for the year. I guess, one question we\u2019ve been getting a lot from investors lately is just given your business is shifting to more of these long-term, multi-year contracts versus spot. Can you kind of remind us how your deposits work on those contracts? And then what sort of recourse, you are setting up \u2013 when you set up these multi-year deals? And then I guess what impact, if any \u2013 are you seeing in discussions or pricing from expectations that crystal silicon panel pricing and poly will continue to fall here in the medium term. And then just maybe as I squeeze in a follow up, any thoughts around to Phil\u2019s question around the pricing, anything you are seeing or hearing or discussing with customers and partners around domestic content requirements and your ability to get that in your price? Thanks guys. Mark Widmar : Yes, so Brian, on the deposits, we typically take somewhere up to 20% in deposit. We don\u2019t necessarily take all of that in cash, but we do ask some cash. We\u2019re also depending on the credit worthiness of the counterparty and the size of the deal, willing to take some of that in other liquid security healthy surety bond, potentially impairing guarantees. If it gets to be very large deals and multi-year deals, and that number would get very large. We sometimes take security and then roll that through the deal. So it continues to stay with us until we get towards the end of that deal. If you look on the balance sheet as of year end, you\u2019re going to see something, a region of $1.2 billion of customer deposits in terms of future bookings on the balance sheet side of today. And we would expect that to rise as we go through the year. There will be some of that recognized as revenue. So it\u2019ll come off being deferred revenue, but given the bookings trajectory and the timing of deposits placed from some of the deals that we\u2019ve already signed in the last year, we would expect that number to rise through the year. Alex Bradley : Yes. Brian, as it relates to the concerns around customer\u2019s views around where silicon pricing will go, I mean, I think you\u2019re going to have \u2013 you have some customers which are largely ones that we\u2019re not obviously negotiating and closing deals with that will kind of take their leading indicators from what they\u2019re seeing with Chinese excess capacity that\u2019s being added and poly prices which have kind of lift sort of around. I think they dropped pretty significantly, then they kind of stepped up back to, I think they\u2019re somewhere in the $30 or something like that per kilogram, which is down slightly from year end. But I think they were trending down to in the 20s, low 20s, and they bounced back from there. So some customers are taking their clues from there. Others are looking at if they will. Let\u2019s look at the Christmas silicon supply that is actually able to address whether it\u2019s the U.S. market or even the India market. And that\u2019s largely going to be in India particular, it\u2019ll be domestic production. In the U.S., there\u2019s potentially some supply that can come from Southeast Asia and address the U.S. market, but it also generally is going to have to use non-Chinese poly. And obviously that\u2019s more of a constrained available resource than Chinese poly. And so \u2013 and then there\u2019s also the component around domestic content and policy criteria and ultimately what defines domestic content. And there's still a lot of work to be done there, but I think there is momentum going on that says there has to be true substance for production in the U.S. in order to meet the domestic content criteria, which is more than \u2013 most likely just module assembly and it could potentially include the cell. And as of right now, there's not a lot of announcements in the U.S., where there'll be actually not just module assembly but cell production here in the U.S., and again, having to use non-Chinese poly to do that. And so I think when everybody takes all those dynamics together and evaluate where, what type of risk profile they're wanting to accept, the great thing about IRA is that there's a piece for everyone, right? The opportunity for everyone, whether you're the developer or whether you're the module manufacturer or whether you're the IPP or the utility who's going to own the generating asset over time, there's opportunity for everybody. And so the question is, do you want to sort of secure your business plan and take risk off the table? And if you're willing to do that and do that at a fair price, then First Solar is a great option to do that. If you're trying to take some risk and you're wanting to find opportunities to avail yourself to potentially alternative supplies that maybe will still allow you to benefit to the maximum potential under IRA, then that's a risk that some may want to take and wait. But what we see right now is that we've got more than enough opportunity to engage. Yes, it's an item that is in some of our customers' thought process. But for the most part, most people aren't paying a lot of attention to it in that regard. Pricing-wise, in the U.S. and domestic content, look the deals that we're pricing today include both domestic production and include international production. We are differentiated in the pricing. We're not reflecting that in the breakout into the bookings ASP, but we are differentiated pricing. So our domestic production will be generally at a premium to our international production. So that is being captured in the bookings that we're recognizing today. Now, there is a whole bunch of volume that sits in 2024 and 2025 that we are engaging with customers on to have conversations for certainty of allocation, because the contracts in 2024 and 2025 do not require specific allocation from a specific factory. So in those cases, we are talking about if we are allocating from a domestic production there should be some consideration for that and potential adjustments to ASPs, which is what we referenced before in the last quarter. We booked 1.4 gigawatts in the last earnings call, this last quarter we booked a few more hundreds of megawatts, not a lot, but a few more. And most of that's coming through at a nice uplift around $0.03 to $0.04. So a lot of opportunities still to go get that and work to be done. We'll update you over the next few quarters if we realize that benefit. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And now we will go to Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Colin Rusch : Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk just a little bit about the cadence of CapEx as well as the unwind on the deferred revenue? Mark Widmar : Yes. So the forecast is about 2 billion of CapEx through this year on the construction asset side of the plant. You're going to see that on a fairly regular cadence through the year for Alabama. On the U.S. and India side, you're going to see the remaining CapEx spend on those plants be towards the front end of the year. There's some more R&D CapEx occurring at the back end of the year, so you're going to see that be relatively even across the year on a blended basis, but from different areas. In terms of the unwind we don't expect to see significant amounts of the current deferred revenue actually recognized this year. There's about 1.2 on the balance sheet today. I think it's going to be something recent. 100 million to 200 million of that will roll off this year and be recognized as revenue, so not a meaningful number added to that current deposit base. As I said, we expect to add material amounts to that this year. The significant portion of that is from deferred deposits for deals that have already been signed and therefore, it's simply a question of the timing of that posting. There is a piece that relates to future bookings and our assumptions, and that will depend a little bit on the timing of bookings, the total volume of bookings for this year. But the majority of our expectation is for deals that have already signed and that we'll get deposits just based on the time schedule already agreed. Operator : And next we will go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, it's Alex [indiscernible] for Julien. Just one quick one. You mentioned some caution at this point about announcing further expansions, I'm just curious if you can elaborate what sort of guidance or indications you're looking for in order to think about expansion? And then would you think about possibly doing something in the U.S. as far as a produced basis to sell into other markets, thinking places like Europe specifically, if you were to announce additional expansions at this point? Thanks. Mark Widmar : Look, as it relates to the expansion, we'd like to make sure \u2013 we believe we have a thorough understanding of the intent of the IRA and the policies that are applicable to domestic manufacturing in the ITC, manufacturing tax credit, excuse me, as well as the domestic components that would avail to an ITC bonus, but there's still clarity for definitions that we want to make sure that we understand. So where we are right now is we're actively evaluating to the point of engaging with our tool vendors, to the point of even looking at site selections and getting to a point where we can be shovel-ready as quickly as possible. But we want to get the additional clarity just so there's nothing that pivots in a direction that we're not envisioning at this point in time. For us personally as well as what the criteria is going to be for crystalline silicon manufacturing as well to begin production in the U.S., we believe that the intent of IRA is to create enduring long-term supply chains, which would therefore motivate and align the incentives to true manufacturing in the U.S., more than just final module assembly with all the build material being sourced from international locations. And if everything lines up along those lines, then that sort of helps inform our view there as it relates to the inherent value of more domestic manufacturing, plus we want to make sure that, while we believe we're fully entitled to the vertically integrated manufacturing tax credit, to the extent that we can get confirmation through guidance from IRS and Treasury, that would be very beneficial as we think about factory expansion.  And then the other is just working through our supply chain glass, in particular. Our new Series seven product in the U.S. is 90-plus percent of the production of the build materials here in the U.S. And we've got to continue to expand our supply chain for things like steel, back rails and glass \u2013 cover glass and substrate glass, for example.  So we're working through all that. And so we just \u2013 we're being patient. We're obviously focused very much on continuing to see the demand and strong bookings that we have been able to capture over the last several quarters. So that bodes well for furthering that investment decision.  As it relates to exports, I think we got to all be real careful with that. I think that in some limited capability, that would make some sense. But if you look at even what's going on in India right now, that they've provided a lot of incentives to the domestic industry, which are, unfortunately, choosing a set of supporting the domestic market, exporting products into the U.S. right now because of higher ASPs in the U.S., and clearly, that's not aligned with the mode administration and what they intended to do with the incentives that they put in place, I think we have to be careful as an industry as well that if we are availing ourselves to significant incentives here in the U.S. And not supporting our domestic needs, and then I think we could all compromise the \u2013 and put at risk the IRA and the benefits that have been created through IRA. And the thing we should just \u2013 my view around this is we've got 10 years of has been very well documented and very well thought out from an IRA standpoint, let's stay, true to the spirit and intent. And that is to help the U.S. create long-term energy independence and security in manufacturing in the U.S. and then exporting internationally, I'm not sure aligns with what the original spirit was of the Act. Operator : And now we'll take a question from Maheep Mandloi of Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi : Hi, Maheep Mandloi from Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking the questions. And slightly to talk about the revolving credit facility, could you just talk about the timing on that? And Also, does that kind of avoid the need for any other capital needs as and when you decide to add new capacity here? Thanks. Alex Bradley : Yes. So the main reason there is if you look at cash flow generated across the business, we sell today the vast majority of our products into the U.S., both from our U.S. facilities and our Malaysia and Vietnam facilities. However, the way that our profitability works is we transfer price, the significant amount of the profitability associated with production of the international modules back to the international locations, and we also send cash back as well.  If you look at our CapEx for the year, about three quarters of the forecast CapEx for the year is going to be in the U.S. And so what we expect to see over the year is that as our cash profile comes down, we're starting the year at about $2.4 billion of net cash, we have, about a forecast, $2 billion CapEx program. You look at the year-end cash, the guide takes us $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion, that implies about $1 billion of cash. What we're going to see is we're going to have our U.S. cash balance come down more than our international cash balance.  So what a revolver does is it gives us flexibility in terms of being able to manage jurisdictional mix of cash. In terms of timing, we're not in a rush to do this. We've got plenty of liquidity in the U.S. today. So it's something we're looking at right now, but not something we're rushing into. In terms of other capital, as we mentioned on the call, if you look at our current forecast spend profile, our current forecast, manufacturing expansion and R&D profile, we can finance everything that we have in front of us without the need to go out and raise additional capital. That said, if we were to add incremental capacity, something that we continue to look at, or if we were to find other opportunities in the R&D space, we may need to raise capital at that point. So something we're continuing to look at. And as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, we intend to hold an Analyst Day later this year. We'll give a more update there around our liquidity and capital plans. Operator : And now we will go to Joseph Osha of Guggenheim. Joseph Osha : Hi, thanks. Further to the conversation we're just having, if you think about the manufacturing credit and the fact that it looks to me, based on your cash guide, like you're going to book a lot of it this year, but probably not monetize it until next year, I'm curious, on a go-forward basis, could we see that work a little better because this enforces the first year, so you're booking it but not actually receiving. And I'm also curious, Alex, if you thought about any ways to making the future monetize that credit more frequently, say, on a quarterly basis or something like that? Thank you. Alex Bradley : Yes. As it stands right now, you're going to see it reflected in the P&L on a quarterly basis. But what's going to happen is at the end of the year, we'll go through our regular cadence tax filing, which today is typically occurs somewhere around six to nine months after the end of the year. That will then go over to treasury to the IRS, and there'll be some time, after which, they will review that and then process a direct paid cash payment. So we expect that to be most likely slower in the first year. As this program gets underway, there's some chance that it may speed up a little bit. But it's not going to be a case where you're going to see cash coming in, in the same year as you're recognizing value from the credit in the P&L. So it's one of the reasons why if you look at our cash balance today, you're right, there's no cash reflection from the IRA credit in 2023. We expect that will come through in 2024 and potentially even up into 2025. As I said, the first year might take a bit of time. We may see some increase in speed thereafter. Operator : And with that, everyone that does conclude today's question-and-answer session and today's call. We'd like to thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Mr. Romero, you may begin. Richard Romero : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will begin by providing a business and strategy update, Alex will then discuss our financial results for the quarter. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and including risks and uncertainties related to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark? Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. As we noted on our last earnings call, we entered 2023 and its initially stronger commercial and operational and financial position than the previous year, setting the stage for growth and improved profitability in 2023 and beyond. The first quarter of the year reflects this direction as we commission our latest factory in the United States. It started production of our next-generation Series 7 modules. Secured a manufacturing incentive award in India, progressed our technology road map with a new cell efficiency record and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum. It\u2019s important to emphasize that our point of differentiation from our unique CadTel technology and vertically-integrated manufacturing process to our commitment to responsible solar, continue to set First Solar apart from the competition and are the primary enablers of our long-term competitiveness. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from the first quarter. This quarter, we strategically built on our backlog with 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call at an average ASP of $0.318 per watt, excluding adjusters were applicable. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 12.1 gigawatts. While at the same time, our total pipeline for future bookings opportunities has grown to 113 gigawatts and includes 73 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. From a Series 6 manufacturing perspective, we produced 2.36 gigawatts of product in the first quarter, with an average watt per module of 467, a top bin class of 475 watts and a manufacturing yield of 98%. This solid performance is the result of a relentless focus on manufacturing excellence. Regarding Series 7, the ramp at our third Ohio facility, which began production in January is progressing well. We produced 170 megawatts in the quarter and recently both demonstrated high-volume manufacturing production capability of up to 10,000 modules per day, which is approximately 60% of nameplate throughput and achieved a production top bin of 535 watts. Developed in close collaboration with EPCs, structured and component providers, Series 7 reflects First Solar's ethos of competitive differentiation. Responsibly manufactured in America, largely using domestically sourced components, including American made glass and steel, and entirely produced under one roof. It is optimized for the utility scale market and features a large form factor and an innovative new back rail mounting system. This design is expected to deliver improved efficiency, enhanced installation velocity and unmatched lifetime energy performance for utility scale projects. We are tracking to begin customer shipments as early as June of 2023, and towards that goal, we are pleased to have recently received Series 7 IEC and UL product certifications. From a technology perspective, in Q1, we certified a new world record CadTel cell with a conversion efficiency of 22.3%. Most importantly, this was achieved in our CuRe technology platform, which provides a significantly improved energy profile. In addition, we recently received an award from the U.S. Department of Energy related to our tandem module development. Moving to Slide 4. We are pleased with production progress at our manufacturing and R&D facilities expansions. In India at our new Series 7 factory in Chennai, final building and facility works are nearly complete, and the factory has been energized. Tool installation is ongoing, and we received our first incent to operate and expect to begin production and ramping activities during the second quarter -- second half, excuse me, of 2023. Once fully ramped, this facility is expected to add 3.54 gigawatts of annual nameplate manufacturing capacity to the fleet. As previously announced, the India facility has also been allocated financial incentives under the Indian government's production-linked incentive program. First Solar was 1 of only 3 manufacturers selected to receive the full range of incentives, which are reserved for a fully vertically-integrated manufacturing. The incentives are subject to the facility meeting product efficiency and domestic value creation thresholds, which we will evaluate on a quarterly basis beginning in the second quarter of 2026 through 2031. In Ohio, our project to upgrade and expand the annual throughput of our Series 6 factories by an aggregate of 0.70 gigawatts is also advancing. Tools have been ordered and the additional capacity is expected to come online in 2024. In Alabama, our fourth U.S. factory has received its environmental permits and foundation of early factory construction is underway. Tools have been ordered and the facility remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2024, with commercial operations ramping through 2025. When fully operational, these expansions in Ohio and Alabama are expected to increase our annual nameplate capacity in the U.S. to over 10 gigawatts by 2025. Our dedicated R&D facility has also commenced construction and will feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for the production of full-size prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules, and we'll provide a means to optimize our technology road map with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines. This facility is expected to commence operations in 2024. Looking forward, we continue to evaluate the opportunity for further investments in expanding our production capabilities to best serve our key markets. Moving to Slide 5. I would first like to draw your attention to a change in the way we present our contract backlog. In the past, we have shown expected module shipments. Going forward, we will show expected module volumes sold, which takes into account the timing of revenue recognition and aligned with volumes sold in contracts with customers for future sales disclosures represented in the 10-K and 10-Q quarterly fillings. As of December 31, 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. Through March 31, 2023, we entered into an additional 9.9 gigawatts of contracts and recognized 1.9 gigawatts of volume sold resulting in a total backlog of 69.4 gigawatts, with an aggregate value sold of $20.4 billion, which implies approximately $0.293 per watt, an increase of approximately $0.005 per watt from the end of the prior quarter. Since the end of the first quarter, we've entered into an additional 2.2 gigawatts of contracts bringing our total year-to-date backlog to a record 71.6 gigawatts. During the first quarter, certain amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufactured product as well as commitments to supply domestically produced Series 7 modules in place of Series 6, increased our contracted revenue backlog by $35 million across 8.8 gigawatts or approximately $0.045 per watt. Since the second quarter of 2022 and up to the end of Q1 2023, cumulative amendments to existing contracts associated with commitments to provide U.S. manufactured product as well as commitments to supply Series 7 versus Series 6 modules, increased our contracted revenue backlog by $157 million across 4.1 gigawatts or approximately $0.039 per watt. Now we are currently processing additional amendments associated with providing U.S. manufactured product, which will be reflected in our Q2 contracted revenue backlog when reported. As we previously addressed, a substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through our application of adjusters, we're able to realize achievements within our technology road map as of the required timing for delivery of the product. As of the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 34.5 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which are fully utilized or realized could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2027. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments for the ultimate bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust ASP under the sales contract upward or downward. In addition, this amount also does not include potential adjustments for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Finally, this does not include potential price adjustments associated with the IT and domestic contract provision under the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act. As a reminder, not all contracts include every adjuster described here. To the extent that such suggesters are not included in a contract, we believe that baseline ASP reflects in the appropriate risk-reward profile. And while there can be no assurance that we'll realize adjusters in those contracts when they are presented, to the extent that we are successful in doing so, we could expect a meaningful benefit to our current contracted backlog ASP. Our year-to-date contracted backlog extends into 2029. And excluding India, we are now sold out through 2026. Regarding future deliveries. As a reminder, our contracts are structured as firm purchase commitments. In limited circumstances, often related to customer regulatory requirements, or a portion of a large multiyear framework commitments, our contracts may include a termination for convenience provision, which generally requires substantial advanced notice to invoke and features a contractually required termination payment to us. This fee is generally set at a substantial percentage of the contract value and backed up by some form of security. Termination for convenience provisions apply to approximately 1/10 of our entire contracted backlog, with the majority of the applicable megawatts scheduled for deliveries between 2024 and 2025. Should the customer fail to perform under our contract, the ensuing default would in addition to their incurring potential dispute resolution and project financing complications, entitle us to remedies that could include the receipt of the termination that would include the receipt of termination payment. That said, we and our customers, including many of the largest, most respected developers and utilities in the industry, have long taken a relationship base versus transactional approach to contract. As a result, this year alone, we have booked multi-gigawatt deals with peak customers, including EDP renewables, Lightsource BP and Leeward Renewal Energy. We signed a 2-year 2-gigawatt order announced prior to the call, further expanding our long-standing relationship with us. And choosing the contract with First Solar, our customers value and prioritize initially more than just the module ASP, including contract integrity, product availability, uncertainty, ethical and transparent supply chain. For First Solar, this approach provides the opportunity to partner with customers who share our values and also provides greater offtake visibility, which helps support our long-term capacity expansion plans. There's a lot bit of interest, which has been validating the path through multiple pricing and supply demand cycles in this industry, informs and guides our commercial strategy of continuing to enter into long-term multiyear contracts. As reflected in Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust with total bookings opportunities of 112.7 gigawatts, and an increase of approximately 20 gigawatts since the previous call. Our mid- to late-stage opportunity increased by approximately 15 gigawatts to 72.6 gigawatts and includes 65.6 gigawatts in North America, 4 gigawatts in India, 2.7 gigawatts in the EU and 0.3 gigawatts across all other geographies. Included within our mid- to -late-stage pipelines are 4.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracts subject to conditions precedent, which included 1.9 gigawatts in India. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. Turning to Slide 7. Our research and development efforts have continued to be the driving force in the enhancement of our technology. In Q1, we established a new world record Research conversion efficiency for CadTel, achieving 22.3% efficiency, as certified by the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The representing research cell was constructed at our California Technology set. Notably, this new record is based on our CuRe technology, which in addition to increase in efficiency as meaningful lifetime energy improvements in real-world conditions, driven by a superior temperature coefficient, best-in-class cell stability. While maintaining First Solar's industry-leading quality and reliability, our CuRe technology provides or an up to 6% increase in expected lifetime energy relative to our previous record cell technology. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy recently provided 2 grants associated with our industry-leading point of differentiation efforts. These include a $7.3 million award to First Solar to support the development of a CadTel tandem module for the residential rooftop segment and a $1.3 million award to the University of Kansas, which is collaborating with First Solar and the Idaho National Laboratory to develop a low-cost next-generation method to optimize solar module recycling. Before turning the call over to Alex, I would like to take a moment to discuss the policy environment in our key markets. In the United States, with respect to the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to await guidance related to the domestic content bonus provision. We believe it is imperative that the United States Treasury Department issued guidance consistent with the congressional intent of the IRA, which is to nurture true domestic solar manufacturing, ensuring a robust domestic supply chain for American made solar modules. It is critical the guidance recognized that to qualify for the bonus. At a minimum, the manufacturing of solar cells must occur in the United States. This is not only consistent with clear objective of the IRA, but it's also supported by the legal framework under the Buy America Act Regulations expressly referenced by Congress in the Enacto. While the attend of the IRA and regulations governed and are clear, it is unfortunate that sections of the industry are advocating that treasury grant some form of waiver that would allow bonus credits for solar panels assembled using 4 subcomponents, such as solar cells. We believe that any such waiver runs contrary to the letter of the law and congressional intent. The purpose of the bonus credit is to incentivize domestic manufacturing and the creation of a domestic solar supply chain and not to create an entitlement simply to support foreign manufacturers. With regards to international policy, we are seeing some progress in the EU, which has released its new state aid guidelines in the form of the temporary prices and transition framework, and a draft that is net zero law. The stated guidelines create the framework for allowing EU member states under certain conditions to match aid received by clean energy technology manufacturers elsewhere, including under the IRA. The net zero law will establish new ambitions to meet regional needs with domestically produced content, prioritize net zero projects and technologies and address existing issues such as permitting. As previously mentioned, policy, among other considerations continues to influence our evaluation of potential additional manufacturing expansion. Such expansions would require further clarity including in the U.S., satisfactory treasury guidance with respect to domestic content and in Europe, further clarity on EU member states incentives for domestic manufacturing. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q1 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Turning on Slide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter. Net sales in the first quarter were $548 million, a decrease of $454 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease in net sales was primarily driven by an expected shift in the timing of module sales as we increased shipments to our distribution centers, both to mitigate logistics costs as well as to align future shipments to customers with contractual delivery schedules, along with the completion of sale of our Luz del Norte project in the prior quarter. These decreases were partially offset by an expected increase in module ASPs and certain earn-outs on legacy systems projects. Gross margin was 20% in the first quarter compared to [indiscernible]. This increase was primarily driven by expected benefits from Inflation Reduction Act of $70 million and lower sales rate, partially offset by $19 million of ramp costs of our new Series 7 factory in Ireland. Although logistics costs decreased during the quarter, they continue to remain elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. During the first quarter, they reduced gross margin by 15 percentage points. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect to see a reduction in logistics costs radical. As further described in our 10-Q and most recent 10-K, Inflation Reduction Act of a certain tax benefits for solar modules and solar module components, manufactured in the United States and sold to third parties. As of components, the benefit is equal to $12 per square meter for a PV wafer, $0.04 per watt for a PV cell and $0.07 per watt for a PV module. Based on the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a benefit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module sold. We recognize these benefits of a reduction to cost of sales in the period of modules of sold customers. In the first quarter, 158 megawatts of the U.S. produced volumes sold was produced in 2022 and was not eligible for any of these benefits. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $75 million in the first quarter, an increase of approximately $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Production start-up expense, which is included in operating expenses was $19 million in the first quarter decreased approximately $13 million compared to the fourth quarter, driven by the start of the plant qualification process, a new Series 7 factory in Ohio. Our first quarter operating income was $18 million, which included depreciation and amortization and accretion of $69 million, production start-up expenses of $19 million and share-based compensation expense of $7 million. With regard to other income and expense, our first quarter interest income increased by $8 million due to higher interest rates and cash and time deposits. As a reminder, other income in the fourth quarter included a gain of $30 million in connection with the sale of our Luz del Norte project as far is lenders agreed to give a portion of the outstanding loan balance as part of that transaction. We recorded a tax benefit of $7 million in the first quarter, a tax expense of $1 million in the prior quarter. The increase in tax expense driven by excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards divested during the period, partially offset by higher pretax income. Combination of the aforementioned items led the first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.40 compared to a fourth quarter net loss per share of $0.07. Next on Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $2.3 billion, and $2.6 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new plants in Ohio, Alabama and India and payments for operating expenses, partially offset by a drawdown in our India credit facility and advanced payments received on future module sales. As relates to advance payments, substantially all our contracts in our backlog at the time of booking we typically require payment security and for cash deposits, bank guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit or parent guarantees, targeting up to 20% of the contract value. During 2022, as we started contracting further into the future, we generally started requiring a higher percentage of cash deposits. Reflects our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, these deposits totaled approximately $1.3 billion as of quarter end and are providing a significant portion of the financial resources required on their existing expansion efforts. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $320 million, an increase of $136 million from the fourth quarter as a result of the low drawdown on our credit facility related to the development and construction of a manufacturing facility in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.4 billion to $2 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flow use in operations were $35 million in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $371 million during the period. Given the recent uncertainty in the banking sector, I would like to note that our investment policy and approach to managing liquidity focused on preservation of investment principle, the media availability of adequate liquidity, followed by return on capital. Continuing this policy, we place our investments for the group of high-quality financial institutions focused on creditworthiness and diversification. We do not have cash invested in regional or super regional banks. And in the quarter, we increased our holding in U.S. treasuries. In addition, we continue to evaluate putting in place our revolving credit facility to support jurisdictional cash management as well as provide short-term optionality. Turn to Slide 9, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged from previous earnings and guidance call in late February. Let's reiterate from an earnings cadence perspective, as previously noted on our February earnings guidance call, we anticipate our earnings profile will be higher in the second half of the year due to contractual delivery schedules, timing of first sales of our Series 7 products and the timing of recognition of Section 45X benefits, driven by both the timing of volumes sold as well as the inventory lag when a product sold in the early part of 2023 may have been manufactured in 2022. For Series 6, following on the sale of 158 megawatts in Q1 that was not eligible for the Section 45X tax benefit, we have approximately 50 megawatts of U.S. manufactured product remaining in inventory that is not eligible to Section 45X, substantially all of which is expected to be sold in the second quarter. Regards to Series 7, we expect to begin shipping products from our third Perrysburg factory in June, and therefore, expect to its revenue and Section 45X benefit recognition in the second half of the year. From a volume perspective, we expect first half volumes sold including 1.9 gigawatts of sales in Q1, totaled 4.3 to 4.5 gigawatts, flying second half volumes sold of between 7.3 and 8 gigawatts. From a Section 45X perspective, based on the aforementioned factors, we expect to recognize approximately 25% of our full year guidance in the first half of the year and approximately 75% in the second half. As it relates to our longer-term outlook beyond 2023, we plan to hold an Analyst Day in our Ohio campus on September 7, 2023, which will include a live broadcast. So on Slide 10, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand continues to be robust with 12.1 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, driven 4.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, with average ASP of $0.318, leading to a record contracted backlog of 71.6 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 2.5 gigawatts, and our EMEA, Ohio, Alabama expansions remain on schedule. We also achieved a record cash sale conversion efficiency of 22.3% based on our CuRe technology platform. Financially worth of $0.40 per share, we ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $2.3 billion or $2 billion net of debt. We are maintaining our 2023 guidance in full, including full earnings diluted share of $7 to $8. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to Philip Shen, ROTH MKM. Philip Shen : Last quarter, you talked about how bookings might decelerate. We saw some of that this quarter but the ASPs for the bookings were in line, if not higher, actually, they were higher versus last quarter. How do you expect bookings to trend in Q2? We have some of that data now, but the rest of the quarter, Q3 and Q4? And then how do you expect that bookings ASP also to trend? And now that you're sold out through '26, when do you expect to sell out '27? Mark Widmar : Yes. I think from '26 and '27, I think we're something approaching combined those two, we're approaching close to 40% of that current supply plan being sold right now. But obviously, a little bit more of that is in '27 and '28, but I think we'll make good progress on both of those years. I don't really want to commit to a specific date when we would sell out '27 because we'll do '27 the same way that we did with '26. So customers who want '27 volume, we're going to want to tie that into multiple years. So we're going to leverage that as best we can across the balance of decade. So I don't think that's important not quickly we sell that, but it's how we use that '27 volume strategically to create more multiyear agreements and visibility as we go through the balance of the decade. As it relates to bookings, yes, I mean look, we had 60 days basically since the last earnings call, and so you would expect just from that reason always going to trend down. But the underlying demand, which is reflected in our total pipeline as well as our mid- to late-stage pipeline as we indicated in our prepared remarks, has continued to grow. So that's extremely encouraging. We have a number of very large deals with strategic counterparties that we're still working through. And we are successful in closing one or two of those. And in the second quarter, we could see a very strong result for the second quarter, plus if we can close more than a handful of those now through the balance of the year, I can continue to see bookings carrying forward into Q3 into Q4 being reasonably strong. But they indicated that we're longer dated in some of those commitments, so we'll have to see how it plays out. ASP-wise, I mean the great thing about having such a strong position where we are right now, is we can be patient and book deals that make sense. And there are certain counterparties that we've had ongoing conversation with where we just can't get to a point that is agreeable on price. So their expectation relative to where our expectation is that there's a gap. And so we'll continue to see if we can close those gaps. But if not, there's enough opportunity with other partners out there that we think we can continue to get strong ASPs. We have said, I want to make sure clear that as we do book the India volume, we've indicated before that India volume will have a lower ASP but still a very attractive gross margin on a cents per watt basis as well as on a percentage basis plus now that we also have the opportunity for the production-linked incentive, which will carry forward into making those opportunities more accretive if we're able to realize that benefit. So ASP trends will continue to work through them in a very patient manner for the U.S. We're pretty optimistic with where we are right now, and we'll continue to see how the balance of the year plays out. And also, as we indicated, we've more opportunity to look to capture technology adders. We also have the opportunity to capture the domestic content in Series 7 uplifts that are already embedded in our contracts. And I think the team did a great job in the first quarter here, realizing another $35 million of ASP uplift because of that. And as I indicated, we have a number of other deals that we're working through right now and close, which will then be capturing reported in our next quarter call. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Kashy Harrison, Piper Sandler. Kashy Harrison : So my question is around your capital allocation strategy. So if we look over the next 10 years or so, it looks like you're positioned to generate, call it, north of $10 billion from the manufacturing credits or pace of what you've been done so far. It seems like it would be pretty questionable political move to use that cash to return capital to shareholders, and there's only so much money you can spend on R&D each year. And so Mark, Alex, when you look at the business over the next decade, assuming treasury guidance comes in line with your expectation, is it a safe assumption that you're going to use that cash to expand manufacturing capacity? And if not, what are you going to do with all that cash? Alex Bradley : So look, I think the near-term answer is it's not going to be a problem for us over the next couple of years. If you look at where we are right now, we started this year with $2.6 billion gross, $2.4 billion net. We're planning to end the year from a forecast basis about $1.35 billion, I think at the midpoint so down $1 billion or so. Over that time, you've got $2 billion of CapEx in the guide. So operating cash flow is obviously strong. But I look forward beyond that. Clearly, we've given a view of how we think about cash in the past, right? It's not working capital around the business. That has come down a little bit since we exited the systems business, but at the same time, as we grow the module business you do have increasing working capital. We talked about growth expansion occurred where we'd like to use the money more, and that's the best use of our cash, the highest ROIC at the moment. The project business has gone basically. There is potentially some use around M&A. We've talked in the past, M&A used to be focused around development business and acquiring platforms and projects more likely to be used now on the development side, R&D side, manufacturing side. If we get through all of that and we can't uses for capital, where increase didn't make sense, we would look to return. I think given the cycle that we're in right now, we're going to have significant opportunities to deploy capital to increase manufacturing over the next few years. The other piece I would say is that as we think through needs going forward, you talked a little bit about some of the constraints in the supply chain in the near term. As you're seeing more announcements in the U.S. and as we continue to grow, there may be constraints that we either can choose to all of need to help mitigate in the supply chain, which may necessitate some capital investment across areas that are adjacent to our module manufacturing directly. So there's other areas that may either look to or potentially have to deploy capital in the short term. Operator : Next, you'll hear from Maheep Mandloi, Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi : Maybe just on the India PLI. Could you just talk about how to think about from an accounting and cash point of view, is it similar to the U.S. credits? And -- any thoughts of expansion there? And secondly, just on the cadence on sold versus produced. Should we expect a similar cadence between the two as we saw last year through the quarters this year? Alex Bradley : Yes. So I think on the PLA, we're still working through how an accounting work. It's a return of capital of about 24%, I believe, against the facility cost that's going to take place over 5 to 6 years. And we'll update you on the accounting as we work through that. I'll leave Mark to talk about the expansion. But if I just look through where we are in terms of your question on production versus sold volume, I think this is something that confusion around some of the analyst reports potentially around timing. We -- from a production perspective, we will be growing production across the year, but it's not significantly backended in 2023. However, from a sold perspective, it is fairly back-ended. We guided to a midpoint of around 12 gigawatts of sold volume this year. We sold 1.9 in Q1. And the remarks just now we said that we're guiding to a first half of 4.3 to 4.5 to the midpoint of 4.4 for the first half of the year, and that leads you to 3.5 gigawatts in the second quarter and then leads to a second half number of about 7.6. So you can see this from a total volume were roughly 1/3, 2/3 weighted first half of the year, the second half of the year. If you think about why that is, it's a function partly of timing of customer demand when customers are requiring shipments. There's also a function of our Series 7 production beginning in Q1 continuing through Q2, but we're not beginning to ship that product until the back end of Q2. And so you're not going to see the timing of revenue recognition to that come into Q3 and Q4. So that's a lot what pushing that sold volume out. And then, of course, you see a similar dynamic in terms of the Inflation Reduction Act recognition, if you look at how that plays out, we said on the call, you're going to see something like quarter of the total revenue recognition from the benefit around the Inflation Reduction Act, Section 45X happening in the first half of the year, the remainder in the back half the year, and that's again a function of timing in U.S. sales from our Series 6. The fact that you've got some inventory lag carryover of Series 6 being sold that was produced in 2022, and therefore, doesn't have credit, and you've seen most of that the first and second quarter about 158 megawatts in Q1 and 50 in Q2. And then the Series 7, where, again, we're producing in the first half of the year, but we're not selling that product until the second half. So you could see the credit timing in the second half of the year as well. Mark Widmar : Yes. As relates to the expansion in India, India is obviously a very important market for us and one that we're continuing to look to grow. I think there's a sustainable demand profile there that and if you look at their load expectation and low growth to now at the end of this decade, it could be up towards a 60% increase. And clearly, lowest cost form a new generation to help serve that load growth is going to be renewable solar obviously being the primary one. So a lot of growth, a lot of opportunity, extremely -- our technology is extremely well positioned in India. So India is a very attractive market. As we scale up this factory, we'll continue to assess opportunities for additional investments and further capacity expansion in India. But I would expect us, if things progress as we currently envision between now and the end of the decade, we're going to have more than more factory in India. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Brian Lee, Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Just kind of going back to Phil's question around bookings, ASP trends. You had the $0.308 per watt, if I recall correctly, last reported bookings from a quarter ago and then it's $0.318, so it's up $0.01 quarter-on-quarter. I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but can you give us a bit of color around kind of how you had a $0.01 per watt increase from quarter-to-quarter on bookings? Was it Series 7? Is it more U.S.-made modules? I know you mentioned, Mark, the moving pieces around India potentially bringing that blended number down over time. But just wondering if you could give us some of the moving pieces as to how to think about price trends going forward, given it seems like there's still some levers you're able to pull to get that number higher given the results here. And then just a follow-up on capacity expansion. It seems like you guys have been patient on that front, but any updated thoughts on timing and what maybe some of the gating factors are around announcing more capacity given clearly the demand environment continues to be in your favor and now you're almost sold out through '27. Mark Widmar : Yes. As it relates to the bookings and kind of the effect of the ASP sequentially. Actually, there's a pretty good mix when I look across call it, 5 gigawatts largely 4 deals that made up most of that volume 2, I think we announced, 1 was EDPR and the other was Leeward. And one of the things just to be clear on the Leeward is that. And you also noticed that we also have contracts subject to CP bucket in our disclosure, that gets about 4 points -- almost gave us 4.7 or something like that, of which 1.9 of that is India. Not all of that volume from Leeward was actually encountered or booking because there is a provision in there that we could flex it up or flex it down. And what we've done is we've taken a percentage of that volume and is reflected in the contract subject to CP. But I just want to make sure that's clear that not all the 2 gigawatts is actually in the bookings to that 4.8 because a portion of it is in the contract subject CP bucket. And again, it can flex up or flex down. But when I look at those bookings, the -- it's a good mix of international and domestic. It's a good mix of Series 6, U.S. and international. It's a good mix of Series 6 and Series 7. So it was not skewed towards one or the other. I will say that clearly, the ASPs that are represented in there for those different variants will be different. So -- and I said this before, the international volume is generally going to be lower than domestic volume because at the extent we're selling into the U.S. market because of the best content value equation of the domestic ITC bonus. There's also some amount of that volume that went into Europe, which was at a lower ASP. So when I look at it, it's relatively diversified. There's diversity of products, diversity of geography, that blended spill to a very strong result for the quarter, and we're obviously very happy with that. Now it's also lower volume than we've done in the last quarter. And generally, we see much higher volumes and larger agree purchasing power and a multiple-year agreement. You may see ASPs more aggressively into that situation. So I wouldn't attribute the increase to any 1 lever. But what I would say is that we're still very happy with the market and the opportunity and the ASP that we're receiving. As it relates to capacity expansion, look, the -- as we said, the primary engaging factor right now is clarity on policy. And I said it in my prepared remarks, if we -- if the domestic content stays true to the congressional intent of IRA and it truly requires a highly manufacturable component here in the U.S. in order to qualify and the bonus being truly a bonus and not trying to create some form of entitlement, which we believe that should include at least the cell, if not beyond the cell as part of the domestic content requirements to be manufactured here in the U.S. That's going to be a key determining factor in terms of new capacity. I've said before that if there's some reason that, that is not the decision, if it's module assembly only, then we've got to reassess in terms of how do we engage with best serving our primary market here in the U.S., and it may not necessarily be a new factory. It could potentially be a finishing line here in the U.S. because that's what the interpretation is by treasury DOE and White House, that's what they want. They want module assembly. They don't want module manufacturing. If that's their decision, then we'll have to assess that from our own perspective and determine what investments we make. But for me, first and foremost, has to start off with policy, and I'd be very disappointed if that's the direction that they went, I think we have a unique opportunity with IRA here to create an enduring supply chain allows cycles of innovations here in the U.S., allows the U.S. to be a technology leader with solar and other renewable energy. And let's help that's where the outcome is. If they choose to go a different direction and not being strategic in the long term in their thought process and the construct here, then we'll have to evaluate ourselves and determine what's the right deployment of capital. Operator : Our next question is Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just moving back to the comments in the prepared remarks about the termination for convenience. Just wanted to follow up. I think you guys said 1/10 of your entire contracted backlog has that with the majority being '24, '25? Can you comment a little bit about what kind of provisions or entitlements are provided for contracts beyond 2025 at present? Any kind of other nuances or other provisions beyond just the convenience piece? Alex Bradley : What we said is generally our contracts of fixed price contracts. So generally, that's how they're structured going out now. But we wanted to highlight the termination of the convenience. I think there has been some questions around how strong these contracts are. So we want to make sure it's clear that only 1/10 of our backlog today of roughly 70 gigawatts has termination of convenience provisions. And the majority of those are for the 2024-to-2025-time frame, which I think if you look at where module supply is in that time when you think about timing for which people design plants and finance plant, we think it's relatively low risk that's getting booked. The one I was trying to give you that color as to what was out there. As you go out to further dated contracts, they are -- they've always been, which is firm fixed price contracts with the adjustments that we talked about, so upside downside around bin class, some adjusters around things like aluminum and steel pricing and sales rate adjusters, the general, these viewers' protections or pass-throughs of risks that we feel are pretty mitigated by the customer versus us. Mark Widmar : Yes. And then I think we also said is that in some cases, these are regulatory kind of requirements that we have to contract around. These provisions have been in our contracts, and again, on a relatively small percentage of our contracts. Historically, we have not seen customers in both these provisions to the extent they are in a contract. The other thing I would say is that some of these very same contracts that have these provisions were also out there negotiating with customers on domestic content uplift on ASPs. And when those uplifts do happen, there's additional security that has to be posted, which further in my mind, solidifies the commitment from the customer. Also most of our customers view this as a true partnership with First Solar. And they know that if they were to invoke something like that, they would be making a decision to no longer be willing to partner with First Solar. I don't think there's many of our customers today that really want to be that vulnerable given the uncertainty, which could happen at any point in time, right, between geopolitical issues and challenges between the U.S. and China and other implications that could happen that could have an adverse impact on supply chain in the U.S. It's going to be a while before you get a fully vertically integrated U.S. supply chain that would include poly through module assembly. Our customers understand that's what First Solar brings to the equation and they bring certainty and integrity. And I think that will keep most of our partners committed to the long-term relationships and not looking at transactional opportunities. Operator : Ben Kallo from Baird has the next question. Benjamin Kallo : Maybe following on to that first question. Just capacity, Mark, how do you think about it because I think the overcapacity is going to become a bigger worry, at least from our standpoint in Wall Street just because we've seen it before the new announcements. And then my second question is about carbon intensity in your technology and how that benefits you. Specifically, I think I read that creating hydrogen, clean hydrogen will require to get those credits will require solar panels that have this low carbon intensity. So maybe there's a differentiation there. Mark Widmar : Yes. I think when you look at the global capacity and the trajectory of oversupply, I think determining what that oversupply is relative to ultimately what the finance going to be. And I think there's all different views around that in terms of how much growth we could see on a global basis as we progress through the end of this decade. And I do think there are some drivers around demand that they aren't fully appreciated such as green hydrogen. But I think you have to then decouple that and say, where is that -- what market is that going to be easily used to address? Like, for example, India, when you look at India and the trade and industrial policies that have been put in place in India largely say it's going to be a domestic market. I mean, to try to engage and support India on an import basis and to pay the tariffs and assuming you can even get to a point where you have the approved to actually sell into India through the approved list of module manufacturers, that's another hurdle and constraint that has to be addressed. So the best way to serve that market is going to be domestically. So when I look at India and say, well, wherever polysilicon capacity is being added, assuming it's not happening in India, it's really irrelevant in terms of the India market. You have a similar dynamic here in the U.S. as well. The polysilicon -- I mean I understand that there's clearly wafer capacity that's being added in Southeast Asia and the cell capacity and to the extent they can get polysilicon supply chains that can enable that capacity, which generally are going to be non-Chinese source, [probably unlock, probably lock] or somebody like that, which also know that they're enough an advantaged situation as it relates to pricing on poly, and help making sure that they hold it firm. So I think there are some additional challenges that ultimately will have to be addressed for that capacity expansion. And in general, when you look at the capacity expansion, where most of the increase is happening, it's not happening, in countries like Southeast Asia, it's mostly within China. As you read through most of the announcements around polysilicon or wafer capacity expansions and all like. So you got to break that up to the term of what's really the supply chain that can address the U.S. market. And look, we know that there'll be incremental capacity, but there's going to be strong demand here in the U.S. market. And our customers understand that as well. And I'll go back to the discussion on hydrogen. When you think about the key enabler of hydrogen as an example, you can't do anything until -- and I'll just use solar as the example. Green hydrogen is going to require some renewable source, let's say, at solar. Until you take photons to make electrons, you have nothing. And so when you look at the solar CapEx relative to the total CapEx of hydrogen and electrolyzers and everything else, it's relatively small. And when you get into the nuances of handful of pennies one way or the other, a lot of these guys that are going to develop these projects, which are multiyear projects that are only enabled by solar modules. They don't want to take the risk. And so that element of certainty sort of puts them in a position of less contract, let's make sure we can get contract with the trusted and credible counterparty and derisk their projects. And so we're seeing a lot of that in terms of the conversations that we are having. We're also doing a lot more business with utilities who are -- who also are concerned about their brand, their image and integrity, and they don't want to get co-mingled with any concerns around forced labor or other trade issues or beholden to any geopolitical risks that may happen between U.S. and China over time. And so it's a different risk profile that they're willing to take, and they look to First Solar as at their counterparty of choice. The same thing with the technology companies that we're seeing with huge load growth and not wanting to be exposed or at risk because of inability of modules to be delivered for their project. So there's a lot of many -- there's many different dimensions and elements that factor into this that I think put us in an advantaged position and all sort of resonates with our strategy around responsible solar and integrity in transactions and standing by our commitments with our customers. And I think a number we fully appreciate what we've done in 2022, right? So that majority of the projects that got executed in 2022 were First Solar modules at least on the utility scale side. And there's a good element of that, that I think is playing through with our counterparties and we referenced to a handful of them, as repeat customers this year between Lightsource BP and Leeward EDPR. I mean those are great partnerships that we've created over time that are enduring. Carbon intensity has always been a embedded in our responsible solar approach. Our CO2 footprint has advantage relative to our competition, our water usage, our overall emissions, our ability from a circular economy standpoint and recycling standpoint. All that's an advantage to us. I don't think it necessarily plays out uniquely with hydrogen, but I think it does play out with our brand promise and value position that we give to our customers. Operator : And our final question today will come from Colin Rusch, Oppenheimer & Company. Colin Rusch : Can you talk a little bit about some of the supply chain keeping up with your expansion, notably the glass supply chain, the dynamics around that? And then the second question, I'd be curious to hear about is, as you're working through some of the portfolios that you're going to supply, if you could talk a little bit about the size of those projects, how many of them are getting larger? And how much you're seeing in terms of a little bit smaller sizes kind of in the 20 to 60-megawatt range that may get built out here? Mark Widmar : Yes. Supply chain expansion, I think, Colin, you referenced glass in particular but at the end of the day, the module is two sheet of glass and back rail or frame of some type, which has a little bit more steel. Glass is critical. And it's [indiscernible] we're in. We recently -- there was a joint announcement with us and beat around a factory that they're going to now start up to serve our glass needs, the factory that was idle in Pennsylvania, which will now start up and provide cover glass to us. And so one of the things that we're doing is we're really diversifying our supply chain from a glass standpoint, which is really important for us. We're also in some conversations with them to provide and with other parties of coated glass, substrate glass. So we're trying to really broaden our reach and engagement. What's also nice about this as some of those parties -- counterparties that we're working with on the glass, in particular, are looking at solar as a strategic market that they want to be a part of, and we've got a great opportunity to leverage that with them to enable their strategic intent coupled with ours. So I'm more optimistic you would ask me 6, 9 months ago, where we were, I would say, I'm more optimistic now with some of the work the team has done to enable that supply chain from a glass standpoint in particular. Size of the projects generally are larger. We're not really seeing in many of the projects in kind of that 40 to 60 megawatts. I mean most of the projects that we're targeting with our customers are all in the 100 megawatts and generally getting larger and as you start to get into the hydrogen space, which we're starting to see some opportunities down that path. I mean those are 300, 400, 500-megawatt type of projects, in which we'll continue to grow at least as that evolves more and it goes beyond just a smaller opportunities at the full-scale hydrogen projects that are product finance and what have you, those are going to be large projects, and that's why the reason why I think that demand inflection point on hydrogen probably hasn't been fully appreciated with most people's forecasts. Operator : And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session today. That also concludes today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's [First] (ph) Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer, and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update. Alex will discuss our financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. With half of 2023 behind us, we continue to see strength in commercial, operational, and financial foundations, both in 2023 and in the coming years as we continue to grow. The second quarter of the year continued the steady progress established in the first as we ramped up production and delivery of our next-generation Series 7 modules, reinforced our global leadership in thin film PV with a strategic acquisition, and continued our strong bookings and ASP momentum. Moreover, continuing our commitment to sustainable long-term growth, earlier today, we announced that we will invest up to $1.1 billion in building a new, fully vertically-integrated manufacturing facility in the United States, our fifth in the country. Driven by compelling market fundamentals, supportive trade and industrial policies, and robust customer demand, as reflected in our year-to-date bookings, total contracted in backlog and pipeline of mid- to late-stage opportunities, we are pleased to continue to expand and invest in domestic manufacturing in the United States. This new facility is anticipated to be completed and begin production in the first half of 2026. And along with our Alabama facility, currently under construction, we'll produce our Series 7 module, which is expected to be a fully domestic product, and is determined by the current guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury. This new investment puts us on track to grow our manufacturing footprint to approximately 14 gigawatts in the U.S. and 25 gigawatts globally by 2026, reaffirming the growth thesis we established in November of 2016. As noted on previous earnings call, the position we are in today is enabled by our point of differentiation. Our unique CadTel semiconductor technology, vertically-integrated manufacturing process, decision to locate manufacturing close to demand and develop robust local supply chains, and unwavering commitments to Responsible Solar, makes us a partner of choice for large sophisticated developers, both in the U.S. and internationally. As reflected by our continuing bookings progress since the previous earnings call, this differentiation continues to be a driver of long-term growth and competitiveness, placing us in a position to exit this decade in a stronger position than we entered it. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from the second quarter. We continue to build on our backlog with 8.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call at ASP of $0.293 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable. Note, for approximately half of this volume, the customer is responsible for the associated freight costs, which are therefore not reflected in booked ASPs. Including typical freight costs, the average ASP across these bookings would increase to over $0.30 per watt. These bookings bring our year-to-date net bookings to 21.1 gigawatts. Our total backlog of future bookings now stands at 78.3 gigawatts, including 48.5 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. As it relates to manufacturing, we produced 2.4 gigawatts of Series 6 modules in the second quarter, with an average watt per module of 468, a top bin class of 475 watts and a manufacturing yield of 98%. As noted in Q1 earnings call, our third Ohio factory, which establishes the template for high volume Series 7 manufacturing, began operations in January and is continuing to ramp, demonstrating a manufacturing production capability of up to 13,000 modules per day, which is approximately 84% of nameplate throughput. The factory has produced a total of 425 megawatts in Q2 for a total first half 2023 production of 595 megawatts. The factory recently demonstrated a top module wattage produced of 540 watts, which implies a record production efficiency of 19.3%. We sold 215 megawatts of Series 7 modules in q2, and are pleased to note that the product is already being deployed in three projects : in Arkansas, Arizona and Mississippi. Staying on technology, we also announced during the quarter a limited production run of our first bifacial module panels, utilizing an advanced thin film semiconductor. The module, which is undergoing field and laboratory testing, builds on the track record and energy advantaged attributes of First Solar's successful Series 6 monofacial module platform. And we expect to begin lead line commercial production by Q4 2023. Notably, the bifacial model features an innovative transparent back contact, pioneered by First Solar's research and development team. The transparent back contact, in addition to enabling bifacial energy gains, allows infrared wavelengths of light pass through rather than be absorbed as heat. This is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module, resulted in higher specific energy yield. We believe that the transparent back contact is a foundational step towards the development of future tandem products. Similarly, our acquisition of Evolar, the European leader in thin film perovskite and CIGS technology, is also expected to accelerate the development of next-generation PV technology, including high efficiency tandem devices by integrating Evolar's know-how with First Solar's existing research and development streams, intellectual property portfolio, and expertise in developing and commercially scaling thin film PV. Moving to Slide 4. We continue to make steady progress at our manufacturing R&D facility expansions. Starting with India, construction of the factory is now complete, and pre-production testing of the installed tools is ongoing, with the first complete module having been produced in June. We expect this facility to begin production by the end of August this year. And when fully ramped at 3.4 gigawatts of annual nameplate manufacturing capacity through our [indiscernible]. We're also on track to expand and upgrade our Ohio Series 6 factory to achieve an additional aggregate annual throughput of 0.9 gigawatts, with the additional capacity expected to come online in 2024. Similarly, our new Alabama facility is also on schedule for completion by the end of 2024, with commercial operations ramping through 2025. This facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity once fully ramped, increasing our annual nameplate capacity in the U.S. to over 10 gigawatts by 2025. As it relates to our fifth U.S. manufacturing facility announced earlier today, we continue to evaluate siting options based on the availability of suitable land and related infrastructure, proximity to our supply chains, access to skilled labor and other factors, including the availability of state-level incentives. We expect to announce our location decision shortly. Our dedicated R&D facility is also on track with construction well underway and tool sets ordered. As previously noted, this facility will feature a high-tech pilot manufacturing line, allowing for production of full size prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules. This, we believe, will allow us to optimize our R&D efforts and progress, our technology roadmap with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing lines. Note, since the announcement of the Inflation Reduction Act approximately one year ago, we have committed over $2.8 billion in capital investments into the United States across our existing Ohio manufacturing facilities, a new manufacturing plant in Alabama, a new research and development center in Ohio, and most recently, our fifth U.S. factory announced today. We expect this will result in the creation of approximately 700 new direct jobs as well as multiples of this number in incremental indirect jobs, including across our supply chain. Before we move to the next slide, I would like to take a moment to discuss the policy environment and our key markets. Starting in the United States, we are appreciative of the work done by the Biden administration to issue IRA-related guidance on Section 48C, direct pay, tax credit transfers, and domestic content. We are pleased with the direct pay regulations issued during the quarter, clarifying that a five-year direct pay period under Section 45X may be elected on a facility by facility basis, which will benefit our previously announced factory in Alabama, as well as our new facility announced earlier today. We are actively engaged with the administration and working with our customers to ensure that the guidance, particularly with regards to domestic content, will deliver on the IRA's intent to sustainably grow U.S. manufacturing and [reshore] (ph) a vital clean energy supply chain. Before specific -- more specifically on domestic content, we have shared our comments on the current guidance with the administration and are working to provide our customers with the direct cost information needed to enable their ability to benefit from the bonus credit for using U.S.-made content. Our U.S.-produced modules are well positioned to enable our customers to qualify for the domestic content bonus credit due to both our vertically-integrated manufacturing process where the entire module, including the cell, is manufactured in America, and our commitment to investing in domestic supply chains. Today, our U.S. operations use a 100% U.S.-made glass and steel among other components. As it relates to trade, we are awaiting the Department of Commerce's final determination in its investigation of Chinese manufacturers accused of circumventing U.S. anti-dumping and countervailing duties. We believe that the Department's investigation is a step in the right direction and sends a clear signal that the United States remains committed to the rules of international trade law and to trade that is both free and fair. Relatedly, we applaud the role of U.S. Customs and Border Protection in enforcing the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and its transparency in reporting statistics through a public dashboard. Given a significant undertaking required to execute its mandate under the act, we believe the agency needs to be more adequately resourced to ensure the enforcement is extended beyond the handful of high profile Chinese solar manufacturers currently being scrutinized. The relatively narrow scope of enforcement would effectively allow lesser known solar panel manufacturers who may source their polysilicon from the Xinjiang region of China to freely export their products into the U.S. without risk of detention. Internationally, we continue to follow policy developments in Europe where the EU is working towards a path to energy self-sufficiency. While we are cautious [and that] (ph) the market, given the recent collapse in polysilicon pricing and the impact that irrationally cheap solar panels driven by oversupply and dumping into Europe may have on the political willingness to deliver a comprehensive legislative solution that both levels the playing field and incentivizes domestic manufacturing. While we remain engaged with the EU, we are pleased to see its member states move forward with their own plans to reshore solar manufacturing. Most notably, Germany's Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection recently launched a request for expression of interest in a plan to build approximately 10 gigawatts of vertically-integrated solar manufacturing capacity in the country. The Ministry launched the initiative under the Europe's Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework, and we intend to submit a non-binding express of interest. However, we continue to hold the position that manufacturing CapEx incentives alone are not an adequately sustainable solution with Europe's challenges. If mechanisms are not put in place for domestic manufacturers to have a sustained level playing field for their capital investments, Europe will find it challenging to achieve what the U.S. and India have been able to do in a relatively short period of time. Moving to Slide 5. As of December 31, 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. Through June 2023, we entered into an additional 13.6 gigawatts of contracted, and recognized 4.7 gigawatts of sold volume, resulting in total backlog of 70.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $20.8 billion, which equates to approximately $0.296 per watt, an increase of $0.08 compared to end-of-year 2022, and $0.028 per watt compared to June 30, 2022. Since the end of the second quarter to date, we have entered into an additional 7.5 gigawatts of contracts, bringing our total backlog to date to a record 77.8 gigawatts. Included in our backlog since the previous earnings call are contracts of approximately 1 gigawatt or more with new customers, capital power development, and Matrix Renewables USA, as well as with a large European customer. We also signed and announced on July 16, a follow on 5 gigawatt deal with Energix Renewables, a leading Israeli developer and repeat customer; 4 gigawatts of which sits within our bookings and 1 gigawatt of which is contract subject to conditions precedent. In addition, we currently amended a previously booked deal with Energix, increasing the module ASP and committing to providing U.S. modules for 850 megawatts of their projects. Since the announcement of the IRA, we have amended certain existing contracts to provide U.S. manufactured products as well as to supply Series 7 modules in place of Series 6. As a consequence, over the past four quarters up to the end of Q2 2023, we have increased our contracted revenue by $312 million across 9.2 gigawatts or approximately $0.034 per watt. Note, we are still progressing additional amendments associated with providing U.S. manufactured and Series 7 product, which we expect to be reflected in our Q3 contracted revenue backlog. As we previously addressed, a substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters, if we're able to realize achievement within our technology roadmap as of the required timing for the delivery of the product. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 36.4 gigawatts of contracted volume. With these adjusters, if fully realized, would result in additional revenue of up to $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, the majority of which would be recognized between 2026 and 2027. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog both for the ultimate module bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, and for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or sales commodity price changes. Finally, this amount does not include any remaining potential higher rate domestic content price adjustments in excess of the already amended 9.2 gigawatts referenced above. Our contracted backlog extends into 2030, including our most recent bookings. Excluding India, we are sold out through 2026. Note, some production from India is expected to be used to support U.S. deliveries in 2024 and 2025. As reflected on Slide 6, our pipeline of potential bookings remains robust, with total booking opportunities of 78.3 gigawatts, a decrease of approximately 34 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities decreased by approximately 24 gigawatts to 48.5 gigawatts and includes 41 gigawatts in North America, 5.5 gigawatts in India, 1.8 gigawatts in the EU, and 0.2 gigawatts across all other geographies. The decreases in total and mid- to late-stage pipeline from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023 are the result of both converting certain opportunities to bookings as well as the removal of certain other opportunities given our sold-out position and diminished available supply. They also reflect a removal of one large multi-gigawatt, multi-year opportunity, where we were unable to come to terms with the customer. As we previously stated, we will continue to forward contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value our differentiation. And given the strength and duration of our current contracted backlog, we will be strategic and selective in our approach to future contracting. Included within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are 6.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracts subject to conditions precedent, which include 1.9 gigawatts in India. Given the shorter timeframe between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect to save multi-year contracted commitments that we are currently seeing in the United States. As a reminder, [signed] (ph) contracts in India will now be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. Moving to Slide 7. While we will release our annual sustainability report in the coming weeks, we'd like to take this opportunity to preview a few highlights with you. As we have consistently noted, our commitment to Responsible Solar is not a tagline but our way of doing business. This commitment is underpinned by the belief that solar should never come at the expense of the environment or human rights, and drives our company's environmental, social and governance strategy and differentiation. It is this commitment that has driven down our greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water and waste intensity per watt produced and increased the percentage of women in our workforce in 2022 relative to the preceding year. Our achievements build on previous year successes, and we have developed a roadmap with additional initiatives to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 34% by 2028 and achieve net-zero emissions relative to 2020 by 2050. Crucially, we also recognize that we cannot get to net zero without a circular economy. And we continue to make progress on building circularity into our next-generation modules and manufacturing processes from raw material sourcing to high-value recycling with closed-loop semiconductor recovery. This is reflected in the fact that the Series 7 modules designed with sustainability in mind and is our most eco-efficient product to date. It's also reflected in the fact that our new facility in India, which is located in a region of high baseline water stress, is designed to be net-zero water withdrawal PV manufacturing facility, which we believe to be the world's first. As a purpose-driven company, we consistently hold ourselves to a higher standard and proudly set new benchmarks from the hope that by leading by example, others in the solar industry will follow. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q2 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on Slide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the second quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $811 million, an increase of $262 million compared to the first quarter. Increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong market demand that led to higher volumes sold, commencement of sales of our next-generation Series 7 modules and an increase in module ASP. Gross margin was 38% in the second quarter compared to 20% in the first quarter. This increase is primarily driven by the increase in module ASPs, lower sales rate costs and higher volumes of modules produced and sold in the U.S., resulting in additional credits from Inflation Reduction Act. Based on our differentiated vertically-integrated manufacturing model and the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for a Section 45X credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module sold, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale. During the second quarter, we recognized $155 million of such credits compared to $70 million in the first quarter. I encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation and risks related to our receiving the full amount of tax benefit we believe we are entitled to under the IRA. The reduction in our sales freight costs during the quarter reflected improved ocean and land rates, the significant reduction in non-standard charges of container detention and demurrage, as well as a beneficial domestic versus international mix of volumes sold. The lower sales freight costs reduced gross margin by 8 percentage points during the second quarter compared to 15 percentage points in the first quarter. Ramp costs, which include costs associated with operating a new factory below its target utilization and performance levels, were $29 million during the second quarter compared to $19 million in the first quarter. Ramp costs reduced gross margin by 4 percentage points in each of the first and second quarters. Our year-to-date ramp costs are fully attributable to our new Series 7 factory in Ohio, which is expected to reach its initial target operating capacity later this year. We also began to expect incurring ramp costs on our new Series 7 factory in India in the third quarter. SG&A and R&D expenses totaled $83 million in the second quarter, an increase of $8 million compared to the first. This increase was primarily driven by additional investments in our R&D workforce, our R&D testing costs, additional share-based compensation expense and higher professional fees. Production start-up expense, which is included in operating expenses, was $23 million in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $4 million compared to first quarter. This increase is attributable to higher pre-production costs at our new factory in India, which will be prepared to starting production this quarter. Our second quarter operating results included approximately $8 million of non-module revenue associated with project earn-out payments from our former systems business. We also recorded a litigation loss of $36 million associated with the dispute with the Southern Power Company related to legacy EPC [indiscernible] projects in the United States for which we served as the EPC contractor. We are evaluating our options in relation to this litigation. Year-to-date operating loss impact from legacy systems business related activities was approximately $22 million. Our second quarter operating income was $169 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $72 million, ramp costs of $29 million, production start-up expense of $23 million, legacy systems business-related impact of $28 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. We recorded tax expense of $18 million in the second quarter compared to a tax benefit of $7 million in the first quarter. The increase in tax expense was driven by higher pre-tax income and lower tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards with the majority of these awards vest during the first quarter of each year. The aforementioned items combined led to a second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.59 compared to $0.40 in the first quarter. And note, growth-related start-up and ramp costs have impacted Q1 and Q2 by $38 million and $53 million, respectively, for a cumulative first half 2023 operating income impact of $91 million. Next on to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.9 billion compared to $2.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new facilities in Ohio, Alabama and India, and payment for our acquisition of Evolar, partially offset by advanced payments received for future module sales and additional drawdown by India credit facility. As it relates to advanced payments, for substantially all contracts in our backlog at the time of booking, we typically require payment security in form of cash deposits, bank guarantees, surety bonds, letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, parent guarantees, targeting up to 20% of the contract value. Cash deposits, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, totaled approximately $1.5 billion at the end of the quarter and provide a meaningful portion of the financial resources required to fund our existing expansion method. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $437 million, an increase of $117 million from the first quarter as a result of the loan drawdown under our credit facility for our factory in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows used in operations were $89 million in the second quarter, primarily due to expansion-related activities. Capital expenditures were $383 million during the period. During the quarter, we secured a five-year revolving credit facility for $1 billion. We're focused on exiting this decade in a stronger position than we entered it, and liquidity is a crucial differentiation we intend to maintain. This facility provides us with the financial headroom and flexibility we need, while also balancing our ability to grow in response to demand for our technology. Turning on Slide 10, I'll discuss full year 2023 guidance. As noted on our February guidance call, given the declining impact of our other segments, we stated that we are no longer providing segment-specific guidance, but would note any significant impact to our consolidated financials. As it relates to our legacy systems business, year-to-date, we have seen approximately $20 million of revenue, $14 million of gross profit, $36 million of litigation losses within operating expenses. As it relates to our module business, we expect to see approximately $40 million improvement in gross profit relative to our prior guidance. Given their size, these combined numbers do not impact our forecasted revenue and gross margin guidance ranges, which remain unchanged. Note, our full year Section 45X tax benefits forecast of $660 million to $710 million is also unchanged. Our operating expenses guidance has increased to $450 million to $475 million to reflect the aforementioned litigation losses. Operating income and earnings per share guidance remain unchanged. I'd like to highlight that in terms of earnings cadence over the second half of the year, we anticipate that volumes sold, revenue, IRA Section 45X benefits will be distributed approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter. With operating expenses approximately evenly split between Q3 and Q4, this implies an expected second half 2023 EPS split of approximately one-third in Q3, two-thirds in Q4. Incremental capital expenditures of approximately $100 million in 2023 associated with our newly announced U.S. factory are offset by a pushout from the timing of approximately $300 million of CapEx associated with equipment upgrades previous assumed in 2023 into early 2024. Our full year 2023 capital expenditures forecast is therefore reduced to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This reduction in forecasted capital expenditures, combined with an expected increase in deposits associated with future bookings, results in an expected $0.3 billion increase of our forecasted year-end net cash balance, which is now $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As it relates to our longer-term outlook beyond '23, we plan to hold an Analyst Day at our Ohio campus on September 7 this year, which [we'll do through] (ph) a live webcast. Turning to Slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand continued to be robust with 21.1 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 8.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, leading to a record contracted backlog of 77.8 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 2.8 gigawatts. Our India, Ohio and Alabama expansions remain on schedule, and we expect to invest an additional $1.1 billion in a new U.S. factory office in the country, which is expected to begin production in the first half of 2026. Cumulatively, in the year since the announcement of the IRA, we committed $2.8 billion of capital spending across manufacturing and R&D in the United States, which we expect will result in the creation of 1,700 direct new jobs and multiples of this number in new indirect jobs. From a technology perspective, we completed a limited production of one of our first bifacial solar panel, utilizing our advanced thin film semiconductor, and acquired Evolar, the European leader in thin film perovskites and CIGS technology. These investments are expected to accelerate our development of next-generation PV technology, including high-efficiency tandem devices. Financially, we earned $1.59 per diluted share, inclusive of a legacy systems business-related litigation loss, and we ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $1.9 billion or $1.5 billion net of debt, with additional debt capacity of $1 billion under our new revolving credit facility. We are maintaining our revenue and EPS guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per diluted share of $7 to $8. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen. Philip, please go ahead. Philip Shen : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Two categories. First one on bookings. Looks like your ASP was strong and healthy for bookings ASP at about $0.327. And then you have, Mark, I think you mentioned the addition of another $0.02 of adders. I wanted to ask you, what do you expect your bookings to look like ahead? You had a little bit of a quiet period during Q2, but then you ramped it up subsequent to July 1. Do you think that accelerates now that you have new capacity announced? And then, the second category of questions here is, we thought you were sold out for 2024. But in that agreement that you announced today, you highlighted -- and I think in some of the other agreements over the past few weeks that you have more -- that you booked for '24. How are you guys able to do that? Did someone -- did a party cancel their order? Or are you running above 100% utilization? Is there any more volume left to be sold in '24? And how much is left for '25? So, thanks, guys. Mark Widmar : Yes. So I'll -- maybe I'll take the second one first, Phil. So, the reason we're able to still commit to some opportunities in '24 and '25 is really twofold. First is, and we highlighted in my prepared remarks, that we are using India in '24 and '25 for U.S. shipments. Demand in the U.S. was so strong, and we were restructuring some deals with customers that we could meet '24-'25 volume requirements and then pull through out of years as well where we had a little bit more supply. Those deals penciled out really well. So, we'll use some of the India line. We also have requirements under the incentive package that we received in India that there's some amount of exports that need to be achieved. And now there -- what we larger doing is accelerating the timing of those exports into the first couple of years of production in India and using that to support the U.S. market. So that's a piece of it. The other is the ramp of our Perrysburg Series 7 factory is going very well, and that is creating some incremental capacity that's available in '24 in particular. And then we're looking to pull forward some of the Ohio upgrades that we were talking about before. Remember, as part of our overall announcement, we indicated there's about 0.9 gigawatts of volume that we would use to further throughput and drive more output out of our Series 6 factories in Ohio. We are pulling forward some of those initiatives in order to create a little bit more supply earlier than we had anticipated. So all that is helping kind of create supply for '24-'25. The biggest [indiscernible], I just want to make sure it's clear, is really the volumes we're going to support out of India. I also want to make sure it's clear that India is doing extremely well. It's just that we've got opportunities here in the U.S. market and they're attractive ASPs, and we're opportunistically using that volume to serve the U.S. market at this point in time. Bookings ASP, Phil, just to make sure I'm clear, what I said in my script is the bookings average ASP was $0.293. And that did not include sales rates for about half of the volume. And if you include the impact of sales rate, then you would increase that ASP to be north of 30, maybe in the low 30s when you include that volume. That is the impact of the volume that we booked that did not include sales rate. The momentum, look, I think there was a little bit of activity going on with maybe people trying to understand the domestic content requirements, that didn't slow us down on the conversion side. What I would say is that we had a very healthy quarter on conversions. As I indicated, we now have over $300 million of conversions of existing volumes that we already have in the books that we have converted now for incremental ASP for delivering Series 7 as well as domestic content requirements. So good volume, good activity going on there. I think that the momentum should accelerate a little bit from the announcement of the new facility, the new factory. So I do think that will give us incremental supply that will better position maybe a little bit of acceleration. But as I look at the quarter, we excluded about 1 gigawatt of the Energix deal, which was a framework agreement, and that's because there's an option effectively associated with that volume. But if I include that, it's another 10-gigawatt quarter essentially. So, we've been on a pretty solid streak of 10 gigawatts each quarter. If we can carry the momentum through the balance of the year, we have an opportunity to position ourselves for maybe 35, 40 gigawatts for this year. I think that's a very strong result. Given we're going to ship 12 gigawatts this year, we're just continuing to build to that contracted backlog, and we're getting great ASPs in order to do that. So I think on balance, we're pretty happy with what we're seeing from a bookings ASP standpoint. Philip Shen : Great. Thanks, Mark. Actually, just want to -- since I'm on the line, I just want to clarify, your $0.296 is the ASP for the whole backlog, whereas the $0.327 I was talking about, I think that's the ASP for the incremental bookings since the first quarter. Is that correct? Just to clarify. Mark Widmar : The total backlog as of the end of the quarter which was about 70 gigawatts, that average ASP was $0.296. The bookings since the last earnings call, which was 8.9 gigawatts, was $0.293. But that did not include sales rate of half the volume. If you include the sales rate -- normal sales rate adjuster, our sales rate, that equivalent ASP would be in the low $0.30s. That -- those are the numbers. Philip Shen : Okay. Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Operator : All right, thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee. Brian, please go ahead. Brian Lee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the new factory announcement. I had two questions here. I guess, first off, on the domestic content rules since they've been out from mid-May, what have you been articulating? I guess maybe the customer feedback has been around the 40% and 55% threshold. Is that basically going to be achieved by just buying Series 7 panels from Alabama and the new site? And then would you be expecting more pricing potential? It sounded like you did on volumes from those sites going forward. If you could maybe help quantify. And then the second question was just on that new factory, any puts and takes on first half 2026? Maybe it's a little bit of a nitpicking item, but would there be ability to move that up given -- I think, historically, you've talked about like a two-year build cycle. So, is there room to have this even online a bit earlier into the end of '25? Thanks, guys. Mark Widmar : Yes. On the domestic content rules, again, the way it's defined right now is that there are components that will determine if the module is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore, is a manufactured domestic product. As we indicated in our remarks is that for Series 7, especially for our new factories, we'll be 100% compliant with all of those requirements. So, all of those components that have been identified will be manufactured in the U.S. Again, that's a strategy that we embarked upon years ago to have a local supply chain. As a result of that, then the full entitlement for the module will be captured at the project level. As you know, there's no one else that will meet those requirements, whereas other manufacturers who made announcements in the U.S. will actually manufacture the cell and very few, if any, will get glass in the U.S. I have yet to see an announcement of anybody indicating availability or contracting for glass in the U.S. We've been unique in our position there and been able to capture very strategic partnerships around sourcing of our glass. And so, I think we'll be in an advantaged position. Our customers are clearly still trying to do the math. I think there are still questions. But I think there's a high level of confidence that First Solar is the best-positioned module to ensure the domestic content bonus, which is why we also see such a high volume of conversions that are being done, as I referenced in my prior response to Phil as well. So that's where -- from a domestic content standpoint, we're working very closely. We are providing -- we're being very transparent. I know there's been some speculation that manufacturers are not willing to provide cost-level information. We are obviously willing to do that. We would have preferred to have this basically, from a taxpayer perspective, their module price. I think it's a lot easier to do it that way versus maybe the difficulty and the complexity that's being embedded in the requirements right now, but we're managing through that, and we're more than willing to accommodate our partners to ensure they get the -- they qualify for the bonus to the extent of the modules' contribution. And they're still probably working through and understanding the tracker and the inverter in particular and how it all aggregates up with the project level. But I think everybody realized that Series 7, in particular, in First Solar, in general, is going to be meaningfully advantaged relative to anyone else manufactured in the U.S. today. As it relates to the factory timing, look, we haven't announced a site yet. And so, we're still working through the site selection. The timing of the site selection and the timing of the ability to get on site, finishing the permitting, starting to move dirt around, and more importantly, energizing, getting transformers and other things to available so we can energize, will all kind of determine that ultimate start of that manufacturing facility. But I think it's prudent to stick with what we indicated in our prepared remarks. If everything does go well, is there a potential to accelerate? Sure, there's obviously potential to accelerate, but we have a lot of work to do before we can determine if that's possible or not. Operator : All right. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha. Joseph, please go ahead. Joseph Osha : Hi, thank you, everybody. Two questions. First, I'm seeing perovskites and CIGS talked about. I'm wondering if we might get some sense as to when we might see those turning up in shipped products? And also whether -- if we're talking about tandem cells or higher-efficiency products, whether we might see those begin to show up in rooftop? And then, I do have one other question. Thank you. Mark Widmar : Look, I would say on the perovskites side of the house in particular, I'm very happy with capabilities that Evolar brings to the table there. I think it's very complementary to capabilities that our own internal team has. And -- on continuum, maybe slightly different approaches, but both showing -- demonstrating very good results. And again, there's a combination of challenges, but one, first and foremost, that everyone is working through is stability of the device. Efficiency is obviously important, but you also need something that's stable. And perovskites, in general, have -- historically had issues and challenges with trying to demonstrate long-term durable stable devices. So, having there on CIGS6, Evolar has got some very deep capabilities there and record sales that they've demonstrated, it's like north of 23%. And we think that there's a potential for a tandem technology, thin film-thin film that can get to market sooner than maybe perovskites can at this point in time. And there would be a CadTel top cell, with CIGS bottom cell. And if we were able to do something like that, then that would clearly give you a higher-efficiency product that could expand our addressable market. And that's largely why we're investing in the technology the way we are. I mean, we are a module manufacturing technology company. We want to be a technology leader. We are a world-class leader as it comes to thin film devices. Both of these are thin film semiconductors, and we'll continue to evolve the capabilities there. As it relates to when we can get to market, that's -- it's probably too early to determine. There's a lot that needs to be done yet to address a number of hurdles and issues that have to be resolved. But I'm encouraged with at least the platform that we have, very complementary to our world-class leadership that we've taken in CadTel. These are two alternatives thin films that can be very complementary and I think can further our technology leadership over time. Joseph Osha : Thank you. And my quick follow-up, Brian alluded to this a little bit, just stepping back from the just announced factory and thinking more out towards the end of the decade, should we kind of think about 18 months to two years as a reasonable cadence for your ability to add manufacturing given site selection, tools, all this kind of stuff? Or could it be slower or faster? Mark Widmar : I think I'd mark it to that two-year cycle. I think that's probably the right timeline. I mean there's other issues that we're running into. It also varies where we're going to go. If we go to India, I would argue potentially, India could a little bit faster. U.S. is running to a number of challenges, especially around construction and timelines to do that, availability of workers, access to energization of the factory. We're still looking at Europe, and it depends on the path we go in Europe. That could also maybe be slightly shorter timeline than where the U.S. is right now. But I think the best way to look at it is kind of a two-year timeframe. Joseph Osha : Understood. Thank you. Operator : All right, perfect. And our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Julien, please go ahead. Alex Vrabel : Hey, guys. It's Alex Vrabel on for Julien. Just a question on the domestic content one more time. I mean you alluded there, Mark, to -- some of the sort of missing bits that have to be clarified here. I'm just curious, given you guys have already sort of booked some, I guess, ASP uplift in '24 relative to offering domestic content, if there's any sort of, I guess, clawback potential from the developer, if they're actually not able to get it given some of the clarifications that we're waiting on? And I'll throw my second in here as well. When you think about the longer-term, I guess, expansion opportunity in the U.S., you guys have sort of historically been about a third of the U.S. market. I think we have upwards of 70 gigawatts announced as far as module in the U.S. currently. How do you think about sort of your broader market share in the U.S.? And what that could become over time as we get into the latter half of the decade? Thanks. Mark Widmar : As it relates to -- most of those -- just as a reminder, most of the conversions that we put in place that relates to '23, '24 and '25, that's really what the years it sits in, those were all somewhat thought through and envisioned as a potential opportunity through the contracts that we were structuring at that point in time in which we implied domestic content. And to the extent, certain rules would come through, then there would be -- and to the extent we provided them with the domestically manufactured product that we would be entitled to incremental ASP. In other cases, we've left them open, and it was really up to the customer. And if you want domestic supply, then fine, we'll provide it. We have the option to provide it internationally as well. If you want domestic, then we'll negotiate an incremental ASP from that standpoint. So as it relates to any callbacks or provisions in those adjustments of modification amendments that we did, really there's nothing embedded in those agreements that would result in that. Now, I will say on new volumes that we're booking now, there are provisions in there that would require an adjustment to the extent we do not meet the representations that we gave to the customer, right? So for example, I said that our Series 7 product would be domestically manufactured product, and therefore, the list of 10 or how many components there are would all be manufactured in the U.S., and therefore, the product would be domestically manufactured. And we've given ourselves some buffer relative to that. And to the extent we don't manufacture the product as currently envisioned to ensure that all those components are domestically manufactured, yes, then there would be a potential impact for that lack of performing effectively, right? But that's all within our own control. And if the project qualifies or doesn't qualify, we're held harmless. As long as we meet our requirements, whether the project level hits its 40% or 55% or whatever it may be, there's no recovery or clawback from First Solar. The only thing we have, which you would expect under any contract, we have an obligation to comply. And we made a representation around it being a domestically manufactured product. And therefore, those components which have been identified have to manufacture in the U.S. And really, I see that as not a lot of risk because that's what we're doing already, all that's being sourced here in the U.S. Alex Vrabel : Got it. Operator : Sorry. I think I cut you off there a little bit. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri. Vikram, please go ahead. Vikram Bagri : Hi, there. I was hoping that you could give a little bit more color on the expected increase in module gross profit relative to your prior expectations. Just kind of what's driving that? What are the puts and takes there? How much of that benefit is coming from sales freight versus manufacturing efficiencies? Alex Bradley : Yes. So it's a little bit of both. You're definitely seeing a drop in sales rate. We did forecast a drop throughout the year, perhaps dropped a little bit earlier in Q2 than we had expected. So I'd say more than half of what we have added in terms of module gross profit to the guide is associated with better sales rate. But there is a little bit of improvement in the core relative to our previous guide as well. Importantly, just to make sure it's clear, we said that we're not changing our forecasted Section 45X benefit. So it's not an increase in the cost of goods -- on the gross profit line associated with a reduction in cost of goods from IRA benefits. It's all fitting across core cost of production and sales rate. Vikram Bagri : Got it. Thank you. And just one follow-up. In terms of the mix of deliveries, you mentioned some recent contracts, which have projects in Europe as well as in the U.S. How are you thinking about supplying those? Could we expect any supply coming from the U.S.? And then just how do you think about the pricing dynamic in those markets where ASP is a bit lower than we see domestically? Mark Widmar : Yes. So, we currently are not envisioning sourcing anything from the U.S. to Europe. Now could there be a particular deal that we've contracted that would -- because of a particular [win] (ph) that we needed for that project or a particular product that we needed, could it come from the U.S.? Potentially, but that's not the intent. The intent would be to support Europe out of our international factories in Malaysia and Vietnam. Obviously, Malaysia and Vietnam are also our two lowest-cost factories before India gets up and running. When India is up running, then it will become our lowest-cost factory in the fleet. But right now, they're our two lowest-cost factories. And yes, we are -- we have global customers, right, very large utilities or oil and gas majors that one global supply. They have projects in the U.S., and they have projects in India. They may have projects in Europe, and they want to have product and they enter into agreement with First Solar, so we could source not just a particular region but multiple regions, no different than the Energix deal that we announced. I mean that was volume for the U.S. It included volume in Israel. It included volume in Poland, at least potentially identified, which is where they're developing. We will have -- we do have to differentiate pricing in some regards to be competitive in those opportunities relative to where other global pricing has gone. But we still will get a premium. We're not in a position where we're having to price liquidation type of fire-sale ASPs like others are doing right now, because there's a long-term relationship that we have with strategic partners. And I think using Energex, as an example, to the best of my knowledge, they are 100% sourced to First Solar regardless of where their projects are. But I have to make sure that they can be competitive in the market at which they compete in. And I can't establish a market price that's meaningfully out of market, so we price accordingly. Operator : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. And that is all of the questions we have time for today. We would like to thank everyone for taking the time to dial in today. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to First Solar's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the Company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2023 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer, and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update. Alex will discuss our financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. On our recent analyst day in September, we outlined our goal to exit this decade in a stronger position than we ever did. We believe the future belongs to thin film, and we described our long-term intent to be positioned to serve all addressable markets and commercialize the next generation of PV technology, balancing and optimizing across efficiency, energy and cost in an environmentally and socially responsible way. This long-term aspiration aligns with our nearer-term growth, which is underpinned by our points of differentiation and solid market fundamentals, including continued strong demand for our products, proven manufacturing excellence, a uniquely advantaged technology platform, and crucially, a balanced business model focused on delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. This is our last earnest call. We have continued to make steady progress on this journey, and I will share some key highlights related to continued strong demand and ASPs, manufacturing operational excellence, and expansion.  Beginning on slide three, we will continue to build on our backlog with 6.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnest call at an ASP of 30 cents per watt, excluding India. This base ASP excludes adjusters applicable to approximately 70 percent of these bookings, which when applied with our -- aligned with our technology roadmap, may provide potential upside to the base ASP. These bookings bring our year-to-date net bookings to 27.8 gigawatts and our total backlog to 81.8 gigawatts. Our total pipeline of future bookings opportunity stands at 65.9 gigawatts, including 32.5 gigawatts of mid- to late-stage opportunities. As it relates to manufacturing, we produce 2.5 gigawatts of Series 6 modules in the third quarter with an average watt per module of 469, a top end class of 475, and a manufacturing yield of 98 percent. Our third Ohio factory, which establishes the template for high-going Series 7 manufacturing, continues to ramp, demonstrating the manufacturing production capability of up to 15,000 modules per day, which is approximately 97 percent of nameplate throughput. The factory produced a total of 565 megawatts in Q3. Total year-to-date production of Series 7 modules in the U.S. has surpassed one gigawatt. As noted on our analyst day, the factory recently demonstrated a top module wattage produced of 550 watts as part of a limited production run. While still undergoing commercial qualification testing, this implies a record cattail production module efficiency of 19.7 percent. Our India plant started production in Q3 and is continuing to ramp, recently demonstrating a manufacturing production capability of approximately 12,000 modules per day, which is approximately 77 percent of nameplate throughput. The factory produced a total of 154 megawatts in Q3 and recently demonstrated a-top module wattage produced of 535 watts. In terms of technology, our Series 6 plus bifacial modules completed rigorous field and laboratory testing. We recently converted our first Series 6 plus plants in Perrysburg, Ohio, to commercially produce the world's first bifacial solar panel, utilizing an advanced thin film semiconductor. The technology features an innovative, transparent back contact pioneered by First Solar's research and development team, which in addition to enabling bifacial energy gain, allows infrared wavelengths of light to pass through rather than be absorbed as heat, and is expected to lower the operational temperature of the bifacial module and result in higher specific energy yield. Upon successful demonstration of operational metrics in high-value manufacturing, such as yield and throughput, we plan to convert more plants in the future, which will enable us to capture incremental ASV through our existing contractual adjusters. Turning to slide four, our focus on delivering value extends to our manufacturing expansion strategy, and we are making tangible progress towards achieving our forecasted 25 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity by 2026. Construction of our India facility is completed, and production has commenced. Commercial shipments are expected to begin once the factory receives the Bureau of India Standards certification, from the Indian government, which is expected by year-end. In September, we mobilized on our new Louisiana manufacturing facility, our fifth fully vertically integrated factory in the United States. At a ceremony attended by the governor of Louisiana, we set in motion the work expected to deliver 3.5 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity, which is anticipated to commence operation at the end of 2025. When completed, we expect 1.1 billion facility is projected to take us to approximately 14 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity in the United States, further enhancing our ability to serve the market with domestically made models. Meanwhile, we continue to make steady progress on the construction of our new Alabama facility, which is expected to commence operation in the second half of 2024, and our Ohio manufacturing expansion, which is projected to commence operation in the first half of 2024. Additionally, our new R&D Innovation Center and our first perovskite development line, announced at Analyst Day, are also on track, representing an expected combined investment of $450 million. The perovskite development line and R&D Center are expected to commence operation in the first half of 2024 and reflect our determination to lead the industry in developing the next generation of PV technologies, optimizing across efficiency, energy, and cost. Crucially, as our manufacturing footprint continues to grow, so does our supply chain. In the U.S., we recently expanded our agreement with Vitro Architectural Glass, which is investing in upgrading existing facilities in the United States to produce glass for our solar panels. The expanded capacity commitment from Vitro to FirstSolar is expected to commence production in the first quarter of 2026. Today, FirstSolar is one of the largest consumers of float glass in the United States. As PV manufacturing continues to scale in the U.S. and a premium is placed on domestically produced components, including glass, our early work to build a resilient domestic supply chain, which began in 2019, gives us a significant head start over the competition. Similarly, we expect Omco Solar to manufacture and supply Series 7 module back rails through a new facility in Alabama. This reflects our efforts to de-risk our supply chain with strategic localization. Omco only uses American-made steel, which aligns with our intent to maximize the domestic economic value created by our U.S. manufacturing footprint. Similarly, our high facility also served by a steel value chain that is located within a 100-mile radius of our factories. Before handing the call over to Alex, I would like to discuss our policy environment. In the United States, with regards to the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to await guidance from the Department of Treasury on the Section 45X manufacturing tax credits. We also remain engaged with the administration and continue to work with our customers to ensure that the IRA's domestic content bonus guideline supports the Act's intent to sustainably grow U.S. solar manufacturing and its supply chains. As we have previously noted, we share our commitment to the current guidance with the administration and are working with our customers to enable their ability to benefit from the bonus credit for using U.S.-made content. We are appreciative of the work done by the Biden administration to provide a solid legislative foundation for domestic solar manufacturing. The IRA has supplied a catalyst for growth, and our goal is to leverage it to help create a position of strength for the country both now and after the term of the incentives. Beyond the IRA, we are also aware of new anti-dumping and counter-dating duty petitions filed against importers of aluminum extrusions from 15 countries. Consistent with our views on fair trade and the importance of conforming with rules governing trade issues, we will comply with any request for information from the United States Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission while we work to understand the potential implications. Moving abroad, we remain engaged with policymakers across Europe as the bloc attempts to tackle serious challenges to its solar manufacturing ambitions. For example, Chinese modular inventory in Europe, stored in warehouses across the region and estimated by analysts to reach 100 gigawatts by the end of the year, is reportedly being sold at prices below its cost to manufacture. This alleged dumping behavior, driven by overcapacity in a Chinese silicon industry that has decimated international competition for the past decade, represents a serious threat to non-Chinese manufacturing and to ambitions of diversifying solar supply chains away from the dependency on China. It also represents a policy threat, potentially undermining the political willingness to deliver the comprehensive trade and industrial legislative solutions necessary to both level the playing field and incentivize domestic manufacturing. We continue to advocate for comprehensive legislation to safeguard any domestic manufacturing ambitions. Our view is that industrialistic manufacturing ambitions, our view is that industrial policy-related CapEx benefits alone are insufficient, and that absent sufficient trade policy support to ensure a level playing field, Europe will find it challenging to achieve what the U.S. and India have been able to do in a relatively short period of time. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our bookings, pipeline, and third-party results. Alexander Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Beginning on slide five, as of December 31, 2022, our contracted backfill totaled 61.4 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $17.7 billion. To September 30, 2023, we entered into an additional 23.6 gigawatts of contracts, and recognized 7.4 gigawatts of volume sold, resulting in a total contracted backlog of 77.6 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $23 billion, which equates to approximately 29.6 cents per watt. Since the end of the third quarter to date, we've entered into an additional 4.3 gigawatts of contracts, contributing to our record total backlog of 81.8 gigawatts. Including our backlog since the previous earnings call, our contracts are approximately one gigawatt or more, with returning customer Long Road Energy, and new customers, including a new IPP, and an asset manager with multiple companies in its portfolio. Additionally, we have received full security against 141 megawatts of previously signed contracts in India, which now move to these volumes from the contracted subject conditions precedent grouping within our future opportunities pipeline to our bookings backlog. As noted on this day, while the ASPs associated with these India bookings are lower than those associated with the 6.6 gigawatts of US bookings since the prior earnings call, gross margin profile, excluding the 45x benefit, is comparable to the fleet average, given the lower production costs in our Chennai facility. Since the announcement of the IRA, we've amended certain existing contracts to provide US manufactured products, as well as to supply domestically produced Series 7 modules in place of Series 6. Consequently, over the past five quarters, to the end of Q3 2023, across approximately 11 gigawatts, we've increased our contracted revenue by approximately $354 million, an increase of $42 million from the prior earnings call. As we previously addressed, a substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase base ASP through the application of adjusters, if we're able to realize achievements within our technology roadmap, as of the required time of delivery of the product. As of the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 40.3 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully realized, could result in additional revenue up to approximately $0.4 billion, or approximately $0.01 per watt, the majority of which we recognize between 2025 and 2027. As previously discussed, this amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog. Both the ultimate-bin produced and delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upwards or downwards, and for increased sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Our contracted backlog extends into 2030, and excluding India, we are sold out through 2026. Note, a total of approximately 1.5 gigawatts of production from our India facility is expected to be used to support US deliveries in 2024 and 2025. As reflected on slide six, our pipeline potential bookings remains robust. Total bookings opportunities are 65.9 gigawatts, a decrease of approximately 12.4 gigawatts as of the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage opportunities decreased by approximately 16 gigawatts to 32.5 gigawatts, and includes 27.1 gigawatts in North America, 3.8 gigawatts in India, 1.3 gigawatts in the EU, and 0.3 gigawatts across all other geographies. Decreases in our total mid- to late-stage pipeline in Q2 to Q3 result both are converting certain opportunities to bookings, as well as a remover of certain other opportunities given our sold-out position and diminished available supply. As we previously stated, given this diminished available supply, the long-dated timeframe into which we are now selling, and aligning customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, field security, and other key contraction terms, we would expect to see a reduction in volume in upcoming quarters. We will continue to forward contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value our differentiation, and given the strength and duration of our contracted backlog, we will be strategic and selective in our approach to future contracts. Included within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are 5.1 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted subject to conditions present, which includes 1.7 gigawatts in India. Given the shorter timeframe between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect to see a multi-year contract commitment to occur in the US. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the Arctic. Next slide, 7, I'll cover our financial results for the third quarter. Net sales in the third quarter were $801 million, a decrease of $10 million compared to the second quarter. Decrease in net sales was primarily driven by lower non-module revenue associated with project earn-outs from our former systems business, as well as within the module segment, a slight reduction in volume sold, partially offset by an increase in ASPs as we continue to see favorable pricing trends. Gross margin was 47% in the third quarter, compared to 38% in the second quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher module ASPs, lower sales rate costs, and higher volumes of modules produced and sold in the US, resulting in additional credits from the inflation reduction end. Previously mentioned, based on our differentiated vertically integrated manufacturing model, the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for an IRA credit of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module produced in the US and sold to a third party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the period of sale. During the third quarter, we recognized $205 million of such credits, compared to $155 million in the second quarter. We encourage you to review the safe harvest statements contained in today's press release and presentation, the risks related to our receiving the full amount of the benefits we believe we are entitled to under the IRA. The reduction in our sales rate costs during the quarter reflected improved ocean and land rates, along with a beneficial domestic versus international mix of volume sold. Lower sales rate costs reduced gross margin by 7 percentage points during the third quarter, and by 8 percentage points in the second quarter. Ramp costs reduced gross margin by 3 percentage points during the third quarter, and by 4 percentage points during the second quarter. Our year-to-date ramp costs are primarily attributed to our Series 7 factory in Ohio, which is expected to reach its initial target operating capacity later this year, and our new Series 7 factory in India, which commenced production during the quarter. S&A and R&D expenses total $91 million in the third quarter, an increase of $8 million compared to the second quarter. This increase is primarily driven by expected credit losses associated with our higher accounts receivable balance, additional investments in our R&D capabilities, costs related to the implementation and support of our new global electrified resource plan. Production start-up expense, which is included in the operating expenses, was $12 million in the third quarter, a decrease of approximately $11 million compared to the second quarter. This decrease was attributable to the start-up production in our factory in India, partially offset by certain start-up activities for our new Series 7 factory in Alabama. Our third quarter operating results did not include any significant non-module activities. However, the year-to-date operating loss impact for the legacy systems business related activities remains at approximately $22 million. Our third quarter operating income was $273 million, which included depreciation, amortization, and accretion of $78 million, ramp costs of $25 million, production start-up expense of $12 million, and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. We recorded tax expense of $22 million in the third quarter, and tax expense of $18 million in the second quarter, primarily driven by higher pre-tax income. A combination of the aforementioned items led to a third quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.50 compared to $1.59 in the second quarter. Next on the slide, eight, discuss the expensive items and summary cash flow commission. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents, and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, compared to $1.9 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new facilities in Ohio, Alabama, and India, along with our higher accounts receivable balance, partially offset by advanced payments received from future module sales. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $499 million, an increase of $62 million in the second quarter, and the result of the final loan, drawdown, and credit facility for our factory in India. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to $1.3 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows for operations were $165 million in the third quarter. Global liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet remains one of our key differentiating factors. However, as discussed on our analyst day, the majority of our cash sits offshore, while the majority of our forecasted future CapEx spend between 2034 and 2026 is in the United States. As we invest significantly in the U.S. manufacturing ahead of any IRA cash proceeds, we continue to evaluate options to optimally balance this expected temporary jurisdictional cash imbalance, which includes cash repatriation, use of our existing undrawn revolving credit facility, or other sources of capital. Whilst we expect our $1 billion of revolving capacity to provide sufficient liquidity, we continue to evaluate other options to optimize cost of capital for any French financing. On slide nine, our guidance updates, our volume sold and net sales guidance remains unchanged. Within gross margin, we are reducing the high end of our forecasted ramp under the utilization expenses by $10 million, between $110 and $120 million and narrowing the range of our section 45X tax credit guidance by $10 million, both the low and high end, between $670 and $700 million. Given their size, these combined changes do not impact our guided gross margin range of $1.2 to $1.3 billion. We've reduced our production start-up expenses guidance to $75 to $85 million, which implies operating expenses guidance of $440 to $470 million. Combining these changes provides some resiliency to the low end of both the operating income guidance range, which is updated to $770 to $870 million, and the earnings per share guidance range, which is updated to $7.20 to $8. Net cash and capital expenses guidance remains unchanged. Turn to slide 10, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand continues to be robust, with 27.8 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 6.8 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, and an average ASP 30 cents for one, including India. And before the application adjusters were applicable, leading to a record contracted backlog of 81.8 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.2 gigawatts. Our India manufacturing facility commenced production, and our Alabama, Louisiana, and Ohio manufacturing expansions remain on schedule. Financially, we're on $2.50 per diluted share, and we ended the quarter with a gross balance of $1.8 billion, or $1.3 billion net of debt. We maintain fully-expensed 2023 revenue guidance, and raise the midpoint of our EPS guidance from $7.50 to $7.60. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Philip Shen from Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Philip, your line is open. Philip Shen : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on the strong bookings at what appears to be strong pricing. Congrats on the strong bookings, that what appears to be strong pricing. Mark, can you talk through the pricing at $0.30 a watt that's without India? And I think the prior quarter, there were some nuance around a contract with without freight. And so if you adjusted that where you typically include freight, was your prior pricing kind of closer to $0.31. So you guys are sitting close to $0.30 this quarter to maybe a bit of a drop, but really compared to the crystalline silicon price collapse. It looks like you're holding price pretty well. And then looking ahead, I think you guys said you may be selective and strategic with bookings. So should we expect things to slow down from here and maybe fewer bookings in general coming up in this full quarter here in Q4 and maybe in Q1 as well, especially since U.S. LPA module you have compliance module pricing has come down so much there? So just curious what you expect ahead there as well. Mark Widmar : Yes. So from a branding standpoint, Bill, if you look at the bookings for this quarter, all the way out into 2029, so it's totally weighted in actually 2029. And so we're looking much further out in the horizon, which also kind of creates the dynamic of what is our base price and then what is the impact of the adders, which -- as we indicated, the $0.30, excluding India does not include the adders and 70% of the volume includes adders, and there a horizon that especially for the benefit of temperature-coefficient long-term degradation rate that we'll be in a much better position to capture those upsides. And as we indicated in the call, we're starting our initial buy-in production already in Ohio. And so when you look at the impact to the average ASP, and if you were to include the benefit of the adders to and marry that up and align it to our technology road map, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, you'd add about $0.02 or so to ASPs. So when you look -- when you make that adjustment, you compared to last quarter, you look at the period at which we're booking out into, but I would say the pricing is pretty stable quarter-to-quarter. And you're right. Last quarter, we had a relatively large deal that did not include sales rate. So there was a little bit of an impact to the average ASP because of that. But I would say, largely, it's pretty stable. We're very pleased with our ability to go further out into the horizon and still get very attractive pricing in the backdrop of a lot of changes in the very dynamic environment over the last 60, 90 days. As it relates to the comment about being discipline, we are going to continue to be disciplined. We are still supply constrained and we have a road map that will get us to 25 gigawatts. We're starting to see 27 fill up very nicely and starting to put more points on the board that go out 28, 29 and we touch 30 in some of the prior deals that we've done. If we come to the terms with customers on what makes sense for us, not just on ASP, but security, overall in terms of conditions, provisions to the extent they're applicable to domestic content, all that has to balance itself out into a deal that makes sense for us. And so look, that's how we're going to continue to engage them on market, and there's -- we'll see how the market reacts and especially the further events of the horizon, there will probably be some pause to some of our customers not willing to commit yet to that horizon, but we'll see how it plays out. But there's -- where they are now and maybe potentially decline slightly as we go across the next several quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Alexander Vrabel : Hey, guys. It's Alex on for Julian. Just a follow-up if I can to that, Mark. When you think about where you guys are booking, and I'll say this like you guys used to be in the development game as well. So I think you obviously understand the lead times on these projects. I mean, how much is that mid- to late-stage compression, a function of just listen, there's a lot of uncertainty as far as timing of interconnects, permitting, et cetera? And looking out in 2028, it's sort of hard to say which projects will be first versus second versus third. Or is this more that the market is kind of getting back to some level of normalcy as far as supply and demand in modules and buyers are just electing to it? I guess sort of parse that for us relative to it just being really long dated as opposed to a sort of a shift in buyer sentiment or market conditions, if you will? Mark Widmar : I don't see it as a huge shift in our customers' sentiment as they think about their realization against their development pipeline. Look, there are challenges as you indicated, permitting interconnection and what have you. But I think they all still are very bullish about ability to realize their contracted pipeline and secure off-take agreements. The issue, I think, is around when do you actually if we're contracting for module deliveries in 2029, and we're asking for security. Clearly, project is not in a condition at that point in time where they would be able to get financing put in place. So when you're talking about corporate liquidity capacity that's going to have to be used in order to provide the security, whether it's a parent guarantee and LC or actual cash. As you know, the project has to be much further along as it relates to financing debt and structure of tax equity before that liquidity is brought into the mix at the project level. So I think part of it is wanting to have the certainty of the delivery, but balancing that with capacity to -- from a security standpoint that we're requiring on our contracts, and it's just a matter of finding a good balance that can work. Parent guarantees for certain entities can work, but we want to make sure they're creditworthy parent guarantees and guarantees that those guarantees are issued against and that's sometimes for some of our customers becomes a little bit more challenging. So you kind of got this balance of wanting certainty, wanting to engage, clearly want to partner with First Solar, and they also know that and we're a loyal supplier to, especially our partners that have been with us for an extended period of time. But then also balancing their near-term liquidity constraints to the extent that they have then when do they want to undertone contract. So I don't see it so much of the sentiment to realization against the development pipeline. I just think it's you're going out to the horizon right now that people are maybe not as ready yet to commit capital and commit to the liquidity that we need to get comfortable with around security for module agreement. Alexander Bradley : Two things I might note. One is, at the Analyst Day, we talked around the fact that we actually over-allocate in the near term. And we do that deliberately because we tend to see projects move out to the right that gives us some comfort. The other reason we do that is a lot of our recent bookings have been framework agreements with customers, whereby they don't necessarily have a specific project allocating the modules they're buying from us. They just know they're going to need that total volume over a period of time. And those frameworks can be more challenging to plan for because there is often some flexibility in timing there. but also shows that customers and very long-dated bookings are willing to buy without necessarily loan exactly where the products go in because they value that certainty, and they know that over time, they'll find a home for it. So we've been seeing a lot more of behavior, which runs a little counter to your question, but we're seeing people looking out at times and they don't necessarily know exactly where it's going, but they're still willing to make that commitment because of the value I'm doing so. But as Mark said, the further we get out, the fact that we're now looking out into 2028, '29, it becomes part of people put meaningful deposits down and there's just less visibility on the framework side. That's why we talked about potentially seeing bookings slower. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Grace on for Brian. I guess -- my question on competition. So 1 of your crystalline computer recently announced a 5 gigawatts sale expansions. It's I think it's the first sign of whatever is the [ph]equation from China in the U.S, so the CapEx is lower, but can you speak to your understanding of the cost structure for overseas peer building in building? Mark Widmar : Sure. So there's a lot out there, the announcement that was made recently this week. -- 1 of our competitors that will be putting sales in the U.S. And look, there are others that are doing sales in U.S. Myer Burger made a commitment to do sales in the U.S., handle a few cells doing sales in the U.S., they're not a long term and want. But one thing I want to make sure is clear when you said vertically integrated, it's not vertically integrated all the way through to the poly-silicon. So yes, it's a module assembly with cell manufacturing. The wafer still are not manufactured in the U.S., the ingots, obviously not in the U.S. ignores the uncertainty were exactly where the poly-silicon is coming from. It could be from the U.S. manufacturer or potentially, Europe or Korean, I guess. So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. But what I'll say is that if you look at the announcements that they've made, there's about $800 million for the sale and a few hundred million, $200 million, $300 million for the module, which is pretty comparable to our fully vertically integrated. So they're about $1.1 billion. But the -- what I think is maybe the most telling number to look at from a competitive standpoint is the headcount. I think it's 4 or 5 gigawatts. It's 2,700 heads for just cell and module. We are on a road map that will be 14 gigawatts of fully vertically integrated. So think about that from the production of the poly-silicon all the way forward. And our entire head count for 14 gigawatts in the U.S. will be comparable to that 2,700. So on a head count basis, we're about -- they're about 2.5x higher on a headcount basis than we are. That adds about $0.02, $0.025 on a cost per lot base using kind of U.S. labor brings. So I think that's 1 thing for sure that will create a much higher cost profile for that manufacturer. The other is they don't have a local supply chain. As we indicated in our call, we have localized our supply chain. We have been in front of that game. So our blast is here in the U.S. As we indicated, our back rails on Series 7 are here in the U.S. The current components or so that are identified through the domestic content from the underneath the IRA, all of our components of our Series 7 product will be mainly the U.S. That factory will most likely have on at least one major component. Glass is not going to be available in the U.S. There are no glass manufacturers today. In the U.S., it could happen, but it will be much more expensive than it would be to source from Southeast Asia or China. But then they have to pay the freight, and it's expensive to ship glass,, which is heavy from Southeast Asia or China into the U.S. We're also going to have intention to deal with duties, no different than the comment that we made on our prepared remarks, there are duties now that are being considered for extruded aluminum. And there's a potential that it could be applicable to the frame. Our Series 7 product, as an example, does not use aluminium. It's steel and it's domestically sourced. So it doesn't have that type of exposure. So I am very confident, and this is one of the things that we said before is that is that all we want is a level playing field that we all compete on the same basis and under the same policy environment. As long as we have that, I have no doubt that we are materially cost advantage to any other U.S. manufacturer for the various reasons that I've mentioned. We feel like we're in a position to strike. We believe that we have a key point of depreciation around our manufacturing excellence, and we're more happy to compete with anyone who would choose to manufacture in the U.S., and we welcome it. We believe the IRA in order to be successful is to create a diversified supply chain with many different types of technology, prism silicon films, whether it's cattail or eventually parasites or others. We need that if we want to ensure long-term energy independent and security for the U.S. to become a technology leader. We need more manufacturing we need more innovation and different types of technologies to continue to move this forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Osha from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Joseph Osha : Thank you and hello, everyone. Happy Halloween. Following on the previous question, assuming that most of what we see in the U.S. is going to be modules sourced with domestic cell, but almost certainly overseas wafer and poly. Based on what you see right now, can you see those suppliers managing to meet domestic content requirements under the IRA? And if so, just why we're not, I'm curious as to what your thinking is on that? Mark Widmar : So as we currently understand the supply chain and the availability of the domestically-sourced components that were identified under the IRA domestic content guidance that was provided. The only and really identifiable component that we believe -- I mean there could be some small stuff like adhesive and stuff like that, but that's not going to move the needle. But most likely, will really tell us a component that will move the needle, and that will drive some meaningful amount of domestic content will be the cell. If you look at this most recent announcement, I think that you said they'll be up and running by the end of '25, which means largely that those cells would be available for production and shipments and then eventually installation to or assembled in the models and then eventually installation on your project in '26. And I believe the requirements under IRA and '26 is close to -- I think -- so they have to -- so you're starting off at 40% domestic content and it steps its way up all the way to 55%. So they've got a window now that by the time they can actually realize the benefit of domestic content that requirements will be at a higher threshold than it is right now. At least the math that we run just looking at the cell and understanding the direct material, direct labor cost crystalline silicone at it will be very difficult for the cell-only domestically sourced module to meet the project level requirements to achieve the domestic content bonus. Series 7, as I indicated, which is the vast majority of our 14 gigawatts of the magnetic production is 100% domestically sourced. Therefore, it qualifies as a domestic product. it will be materially advantaged in enabling of domestic content bonus at the project level versus just a crystalline silicon module with a in domestically sourced sell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri from Citi. Please go ahead. Vikram, your line is live. Vikram Bagri : Sorry about that. Good evening, everyone. I wanted to ask about capital allocation. At the Analyst Day, we understood that there is some downside to tech CapEx by implementing some processes at the supplier level. Any updates to share there? Also, Alex, you mentioned that repatriating cash, it sounds like, is not the most efficient path to fund CapEx in the U.S. So what the cost of repatriation is. And staying on the same topic, understand that funding buybacks with cash is not on the table yet. I was wondering if repatriating the cash longer term can fund for the buybacks longer term? And then finally, I was wondering if common equity is still off the table completely. Mark Widmar : I'll take the first one and then Alex take all the rest of them. So yes, we are still working through with our supplier to enable various coding and capabilities that would resulted in us not having to make substantial capital investments related to our upgrades for our pure technology. Testing is ongoing. What I'll say is the early indications. A long way still ago. I want to make sure it's very clear. It's a long way still to go. -- but early indications on what we've seen so far is very promising that we will be able to find a way to provide -- or to have a supplier provide the coatings to the glass without us having to do on our own. Now look, there's some trade-offs with that such as the CapEx balance is also the opportunity to further optimize the buffer layer, which is what they're putting on to capture better performance at the semiconductor level. So we'll have to continue to assess respective trade-offs. But I would say, at least as of right now, really early innings. I want to continue to stress that there's a pretty positive indication of their capabilities in that regard. Alexander Bradley : If you think about CapEx, we -- at the Analyst Day, we showed you a CapEx plan for '24, '25 and '26 in sales that was somewhere in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion of spend. As Mark just said, there's early indications that there's an opportunity potentially for some of the technology-related CapEx come down a little bit. However, you think about the near term, the majority of the spend for 2024 is not related to that capacity expansion, R&D facility enters maintenance and sustaining CapEx, so the guide that we've talked about in the Analyst Day of 1.6%, 1.9% for next year. It doesn't have a lot related to that technology a little bit. As you get into the out years, there's more technology related. So if there is an opportunity to bring that down, it's going to be more in back end of '25 and '26. So as we look through next year's capital standard program, still a significant CapEx program that we're looking at. And I think to have fun there, if you go back to the tax reform in 2017, what that effectively did was you paid a one-time transition tax, which is the equivalent of paying federal taxes to all repatriating the money. So the federal expense is basically done. However, there would be state local tax implications of bringing money back. So today, we're certain that we permanently reinvest our capital offshore. If we were to change that assertion and bring capital back, there wouldn't necessarily be a tax impact to the capital pullback as you would see and impact that depends on the P&L at the time to change that search. So I haven't given the number of what that would be, but there would be some potentially significant stable level tax indications of doing that at the time. In terms of thinking about the way the funding -- look, what we said right now is what we need is transition capital, temporary capital. I don't see any request. So what we're looking at is things that will help us bridge through the gap between the significant investments we're making now upfront and the timing of receipt of the cash associated with the action for credit. As I said at the Analyst Day, if we had that cash on hand at the same time that we recognize the tax benefit on the P&L, then we wouldn't have this potential challenge in jurisdictional mix and temporary transition timing. But the need for equity I don't see today. Then to your question around buybacks, look, we haven't looked at that. I think we're a long way from being in a position where we need to think about that. We're going into a pretty significant CapEx spend over the next few years. their capital not coming in yet. So we'll think about that when the time comes, but that's not where now we're going to invest inside. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead Colin Rusch : Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk about how much finished goods inventory you exited the quarter with and where you're at right now in terms of the nameplate run rate in India? Mark Widmar : So let me sure, Colin. So you want to know the enterprise-wise finished good inventory amount? Is that question not just India, right? Colin Rusch : Yes. That's the for the whole company and then understand where you're at in terms of the production run rate in India right now? Mark Widmar : Yes. So for the total for the company, we ended up with north of 3 gigawatts in inventory. But right now, as we indicated, we produced about 150 megawatts or so in India. All that is actually an inventory, we don't have the certifications yet to allow us to start shipping. So there was a little spike in inventory part because of that. But it lines up to our -- if you look at our sold volume in the fourth quarter, I think an order to gigawatts or something like that. So that inventory is lining up to our anticipated shipments here in the fourth quarter. But India, as I indicated from a demonstrated capability, they've demonstrated almost 80% of nameplate. We're actually running that right now about a little less than 70% of the nameplate. And look, that's a tremendous result when I look at it because we just started the integrated run with that factory in July, they were three months or so out, they we're making 10,000 modules a day. That was obviously a step function improvements, but it's great to see where demonstrate that ability to make a finished -- 10,000 finished modules on a given day, not just demonstrated capability that we can do that. And we did that from a standpoint of as I referred to, that start-up was largely a cold start. We didn't -- we weren't able to because of our permitting restrictions and things that need to happen. We couldn't really start running and seasoning any of the tools until we got to the point of actually starting the integrator fund and very quickly moved into our plant fall process. So really good results. Hopefully, that's a forward-looking indicator of success that we'll see as we move forward into our Alabama factory and our Louisiana factory. And again, our goal is always to start these factories up sooner and faster than we had the previous one. And I would say, at least indications from Ohio going to India. It was pretty successful so far long way still to go and a lot of work still in front of us, but pretty happy with how that factor is performing right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo from Baird. Please go ahead. Ben Kallo : Hey, Mark and Alex. Just on that note. I guess the question is two-fold. What do we think about your customers like breaking contracts as that on happens because soon going to open up a factory in Indiana or something like that. And how do we know that's not risk? And number two, what you said there is the speed to time of your factories, I think, is getting better as they get more automated. And how does that factor into your -- whatever ROIC or however you look at? Mark Widmar : Look, Ben, I think we'll -- one of the deals that we just did this quarter I think there may be a press release this week. We added another 500 megawatts on to a deal with partner we have for a while. I think it brings a total of north of 3 gigawatts that we've done with this particular partner. And there's just this relationship and understanding of value propositions that First Solar is able to bring and our ability to deliver certainty against commitments that people look to and want to de-risk their projects. I mean that's their primary focus. These projects are meaningful multiyear investments with a meaningful amount of capital and that are starting to evolve now with higher CapEx dollars for our integration of storage and eventually integration of -- for hydrogen, that at the front end of what you need in order to make that project successful if something has to take bolt-ons that make electrode. Otherwise, nothing happens. And what our partners want from us is certainty. They want us to give them a competitive technology at a great price. That de-risk their projects and allows them a higher level of confidence of delivering against their commitments to their Board and to their shareholders and others. First Solar is able to do that, and we're uniquely positioned. We're also uniquely positioned to provide, we believe, with Series 7, in particular, the highest domestic content qualifying module in the industry to take risk to try to find ways to look at alternative paths so have degrees of uncertainty associated with that. It's not even clear that, that factory that you're referencing will actually be up and running in the time line of which it's been committed. The other thing is a portion of that off-take is going to be for self-consumption for their development arm, no different than the factory in Ohio, which as an equity investor that is looking to take a meaningful amount of that volume for their own development pipeline. That creates a different perception to some of our partners around why do I want to buy a technology or modules from the competitor, right? Somebody that's going to be competing with me, which our primary business model is to be a developer, finer business model is to be the IPP, the utility to own the generating assets to get the return on investment against the project to feed my competitor. To better position them to take market share from me is not in a position of strength that a lot of our partners choose to be in. And there's still uncertainty. I mean there's a lot of things that are changing. As it relates to -- I mentioned already, the potential duties supposed on true aluminum coming in from China and Southeast Asia. That's another risk profile that somebody has to be willing to expect they could be glass specs. I mean, who knows what the next step in the journey is going to be. And all our partners know is that with First Solar. They completely de-risk those dimensions, and they've got a great partner who's going to deliver a great product, great technology at a great price on top. So that's a sense of where our customers, I think, view us. And our contracts, yes, we have penalties and there's ways to potentially pay those penalties and customers potentially could break a contract and we'll take those penalties, and we'll get to sell that technology done into the marketplace to somebody else. But, when they step back and reflected the significant amount of risk that they would be taking for small nominal impact that is uncertain whether it's even a meaningful impact. It could even be a worse opposition for them, especially if they're jeopardizing the domestic content on your ITC. Why would you want to do all that brain damage for potentially roll as any benefit or make yourself -- put some in a worse position? As it relates to the factories and the start-ups, I mean the ROIC -- every one of these factories that we start up sooner just accelerates the ROIC, especially for U.S. manufacturing. That means we get dollars faster -- and so anything we can do to get product into the market faster just enhances the return on invested capital. And as we see that ability -- then as we think about alternatives for another factory, yes, we'll factor that in and say that our ability from announcement to high-volume manufacturing if it's a shorter time line than it potentially creates a lens that says that the payback obviously, could be more attractive for factoring. Alexander Bradley : Just about a couple of numbers around the 7 Asian fees. We tenor Analyst Day that about 14% of the megawatts in our backlog at that point was subject to a termination convenience closed. If you look at that, I mean 86% of our alt scenario development that put themselves in a very difficult position because they have ongoing to see an contractual breach, which will make it very hard for them to seek financing and tax equity for a project going forward. But for the vast majority of our backlog, there is no ability to terminate for convenience. For those contracts that we do have that clause, which typically is when we have larger long-dated contracts, and we have a small portion of that contracts where we have subject some of the megawatts to nation book convenience. We then have an agreed fee typically up to 20%, which we look to collect and the idea there being that we could then resell those modules and be at least may follow on that transaction. So just to give you some color on the numbers. Operator : Our final question comes from Andrew Percoco from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Andrew Percoco : Thank you so much for taking my question. Mark, you sort of answered my question already, but I kind of just want to dive into the cost of capital environment. Obviously, having an impact on the market or the perceived economics of renewable. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any developers or customers that maybe haven't been big for solar customers historically that are maybe turning to your technology because maybe they see your technology and your supply chain as more bankable than someone else? [ph]UFLPA, ADCVD combined with a more expensive cost of capital environment. I'm just wondering if that's becoming a bigger competitive advantage than it maybe was a year or two ago? Thank you. Mark Widmar : I think Alex actually referenced it in his section, but if you look at our bookings this last quarter, we highlighted three large contracts that were over a gigawatt at that total booking time. One of them is a return customer that we made an announcement on with Longwood Energy. I think we made that right around September, around the September time frame. But then we announced there was two other new customers. One is an IPP and another is effectively an asset management entity with a portfolio company and multiple developers both new customers. We're very happy with those in the first step of our journey of developing a deeper partnership with those counterparties. Look, they've come to First Solar for understanding of the unique value proposition and what we can provide. Unique value proposition and what we can provide. One of them, in particular, I know who's would have liked to have gotten on First Solar's books earlier. We just didn't have capacity. And so now when they look forward and they see there is some supplies you get out of '27, 28, '29. They want to secure some of that supply. They were lumped even on the books and '24, '25 and '26, in particular, we did it on supply. So yes, I do think that the environment that we're in right now and first solar capabilities to proposition, I think, are more compelling and is driving new customers into our portfolio and our overall contracted backlog, which is now north of 80 gigawatts. I mean just that can reflect on that number. I mean that's a huge multiyear contracted backlog and commitments with dozens of different partners that uniquely understand First Solar and understand the value proposition that we can trade that enable the success of our business model.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's Web site at investor.firstsolar.com. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the Company issued a press release announcing its fourth quarter and the full-year 2023 financial results, as well as its guidance for 2024. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's Web site at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide a business update and outlook for 2024. Alex will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, as well as our financial guidance for 2024. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Thank you, Richard. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I would like to start by noting that this month marks the 25th anniversary of First Solar's founding, making us one of the oldest and most experienced solar module manufacturers in the world. This is a remarkable milestone in a journey that has positioned us as the western hemisphere's leading solar module technology and manufacturing company. While we're not the only American solar manufacturer to come into existence at the end of the last century, we're the only one of scale to remain today. However, this is not simply a story of survival, but one about the value of long-term strategic decision-making underpinned by a differentiated technology and business model, driving value creation for our shareholders and our partners. Ours is a story of innovation, values, competitiveness, and perseverance. And we are proud of our work towards leading the world's sustainable energy future. As our journey continues, few years have been as consequential to our long-term growth strategy as 2023. Over the past year, we expanded manufacturing capacity mobilized at our latest announced facility in Louisiana, produced and shipped a record volume of modules, expanded our contracted backlog to historic levels, and increased R&D investment and continue to evolve our technology and product roadmap. Let's review the key accomplishments in 2023, beginning with slide three. From a commercial perspective, 2023 continued momentum established in 2022, as long-term multiyear procurement continued to drive demand. We added 10 new customers, and secured 28.3 gigawatts of net bookings at a base ASP of over $0.30 per watt. Despite industry macro challenges such as global oversupply and pricing volatility, we continue to see strong mid to long-term demand, especially in the United States, as shown with 2.3 gigawatts of net bookings since the previous earnings call at an ASP of $0.318 per watt excluding adjusters or $0.334 per watt, assuming the realization of our technology adders. Our total contracted backlog now stands at 80.1 gigawatts, with orders stretching to the end of this decade. While Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our 2023 financial results, our full-year EPS came in at $7.74, which is above the midpoint of our initial and Q3 2023 guidance ranges, and included the impact of the sale of our Section 45X tax credits and the impairment of our investment in CubicPV. These items, neither of which were included in our Q3 2023 guidance ranges, adversely impacted our full-year EPS by approximately $0.48 per watt. From a manufacturing perspective, we produced a record 12.1 gigawatts in 2023, representing a 33% increase in production over 2022. As a result, we have now surpassed 60 gigawatts of cumulative production since we first began commercial manufacturing in 2002. This growth was driven by manufacturing excellence at our Series 6 factories, which produced 9.7 gigawatts in 2023, an increase of 600 megawatts compared to 2022, and the successful ramping of our new Series 7 factories in the U.S. and India, which combined to produce more than 2.4 gigawatts in 2023. Our top production bin for Series 6 was 475 watts, and our top production bin for Series 7 was 545 watts. We remain committed to progressing our technology and product roadmap in 2023, having recently achieved a 22.6% world record CadTel research conversion efficiency based on our CuRe technology, and launched the first bifacial thin film solar panel. In addition, we successfully completed our manufacturing readiness trial under our CuRe program in the fourth quarter of 2023, and expect to begin manufacturing modules powered by this technology at our lead line in Perrysburg in the fourth quarter of 2024. It's vital that our supply chain and logistics operations keep pace with our manufacturing expansion plans, and we made meaningful progress on this front in 2023; key achievements, including entering into agreements with Vitro to supply American-made front and back glass for our manufacturing operations in the U.S. And with OMCO and Ice Industries to supply steel back rails for our facilities in Alabama and Louisiana. We also signed agreements with Saint-Gobain to supply the back glass for our modules in India. Regarding growth, we exited the year with 16.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity. This marks an increase of 6.8 gigawatts from 2022 driven by the commencement of operations at our Series 6 factories in Ohio and India. In 2023, we announced a $1.1 billion investment in a new manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts to our nameplate capacity in 2026. When combined with our Alabama facility and our Ohio manufacturing footprint expansions, both of which are in progress, we expect 2026 year-end nameplate capacity of approximately 14 gigawatts domestically, with another 11 gigawatts internationally for a global nameplate capacity of approximately 25 gigawatts. We also continue to invest in our technology with our R&D Innovation Center and a perovskite development line, both under construction in Ohio. These facilities are expected to commence operations in the first-half and second-half of 2024, respectively. Additionally, in 2023, we acquired Evolar, a European leader in perovskites technology, and as it transitioned its laboratory in Sweden to become our first R&D facility in Europe. These and other investments in R&D allow us to accelerate the cycles of innovation we believe are necessary to extend our leadership and thin film solar technology. Turning to slide four, as of year-end 2022, our contracted backlog totaled 61.4 gigawatts with an aggregate value of 17.7 billion or approximately $28.8 per watt. Through year-end 2023, we entered into an additional 28.3 gigawatts of contracts and an average ASP of $30.5 per watt. After accounting for sales of 11.4 gigawatts in 2023, we began 2024 with a total contracted backlog of 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value 23.3 billion or application $29.8 per watt. Since the end of 2023, we have entered into additional 1.8 gigawatts of contracts, resulting in a total backlog of 80.1 gigawatts. These most recent bookings have an average ASP of $31.9 per watt pre-adjuster, or $33.9 per watt if contract technology adjusters are realized. Additionally, we have received security against 206 megawatts of previously signed contracts in India, which now move these volumes from contracted subject to conditions precedent grouping within our future opportunities pipeline to our bookings backlog. A substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase base ASPs through the application of adjusters. If we're able to realize achievements within our current technology roadmap as is expected timing for delivery of the product. As of the end of the fourth quarter we had approximately 39.1 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters which if fully utilized, realized, excuse me, could result in additional revenue of approximately $0.5 billion or approximately $0.1 per watt. The majority of which would be realized between 2025 and 2027. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to total contracted backlog, both related to the ultimate module bin delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upward or downward, or for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our Q4 and full-year 2023 results. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Starting on slide five, I'll cover our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. Net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, increase of $0.4 billion compared to the prior quarter. The increase in net sales was driven by higher volumes sold, including higher net sales of Series 7 modules as we continue to ramp production at our new facility in Ohio. For the full-year 2023, net sales were $3.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the prior year. This increase was driven by $0.9 billion of higher module net sales resulting from increases in both volumes sold and ASPs, which was partially offset by $0.2 billion of lower revenue from our residual business operations, primarily related to the sale of our Luz del Norte project in the prior year. Based on our vertically integrated differentiated manufacturing model, the current form factor of our modules, we expect to qualify for Section 45X tax credits of approximately $0.17 per watt for each module produced in the U.S. and sold to a third-party, which is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales and the period of sale. In December, we entered into an agreement with Pfizer, which resulted in the sale of approximately $687 million of the 2023 Section 45X tax credits, for expected aggregate cash proceeds of $659 million, received an initial $336 million of cash proceeds in January, with the remainder expected by the end of April 2024. In connection with this transaction, we recognize the valuation adjustment of $28 million within cost of sales during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of the credits to the amount expected to be received from the transaction. For the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, we recognize $229 million and $659 million respectively for Section 45X tax credits, including the effects of the aforementioned adjustment. Gross margin was 43% in the fourth quarter compared to 47% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to the adjustment associated with the sale of our Section 45X tax credits, a higher mix of modules sold from our non-U.S. factories which do not qualify for Section 45X tax credits, and the write-off of certain legacy production materials, partially offset by continued module cost reductions. For the full-year 2023, gross margin was 39% compared to 3% in the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the recognition of Section 45X tax credits, a decrease in sales rates, submerged and detention charges, an increase in module ASPs, continued module cost reductions, and the net impairment in sale of our Luz del Norte project in the prior year, partially offset by increased underutilization costs charged in the period in which they are incurred associated with factory ramp in 2023. The ramp charges were 16 million in the fourth quarter compared to 25 million in the third quarter. Our ramp costs for the full-year 2023 were 89 million compared to 7 million in the prior quarter. Our 2023 ramp costs were primarily attributable to our new Series 7 factories in Ohio and India. SG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $111 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of approximately $7 million relative to the prior quarter. This increase is primarily driven by fees associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 25X tax credits and an increase in incentive compensation, partially offset by lower than expected credit losses resulting from improved collections of our accounts receivable. For the full-year 2023, SG&A, R&D, and production startup expenses, along with litigation losses, were $450 million compared to $351 million in the prior year. As a reminder, we recorded a litigation loss of $36 million during the second quarter related to our legacy systems business. The remaining operating expense increase of 63 million was primarily attributable to higher employee compensation due to additional headcount, higher professional fees associated with litigation, the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits, and higher material and module testing costs for our research and development activities. Our fourth quarter operating income was $398 million, which included depreciation, amortization, and accretion of $90 million, ramp costs of $16 million, costs associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits of $35 million, legacy systems-related income of $7 million, production start-up expense of $10 million, and share base compensation expense of $11 million. Our full-year 2023 operating income was $857 million, which included depreciation, amortization, and accretion of $308 million, ramp costs of $89 million, costs associated with the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits of $35 million, legacy systems business-related costs of $7 million, production startup expense of $65 million, and share-based compensation expense of $34 million. In the fourth quarter, we took a 23 million impairment associated with a strategic investment in cubic PV. Our investment thesis is anchored to their continuing development work on perovskites and tandem technologies. Outside of our investment thesis, they had planned to develop domestic silicon wafer manufacturing capacity. This plan was recently abandoned due to surging construction costs and declining wafer prices, which triggered an impairment. Interest income in the fourth quarter was $24 million, roughly the same as the prior quarter, and interest income for the full-year, 2023, was $98 million, an increase of $64 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest rates on our cash and marketable securities. We're recording an income tax expense of $27 million in the fourth quarter and $61 million for the full-year. Fourth quarter income for diluted share was $3.25 compared to $2.50 in the prior quarter. For the full-year 2023, income for diluted share was $7.74 compared to a loss for diluted share of $0.41 in 2022. Next on to slide six, discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. The aggregate balance of our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.1 billion at the end of the year, an increase of $0.3 billion from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.5 billion from the prior year. Our year end net cash position which includes the aforementioned balance of less debt was $1.6 billion an increase of $0.3 billion from the prior quarter and a decrease of $0.8 billion from the prior year. The increase in our net cash balance in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by module segment operating cash flows including advanced payments received from future module sales, partially offset by capital expenditures associated with our new plants under construction in Alabama, Louisiana and India. Decrease in our net cash balance for the full-year 2023 was primarily due to capital expenditures partially offset by module segment operating cash flow. Cash flows from operations were $602 million in 2023 compared to $873 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by higher operating expenditures in support of our ongoing manufacturing expansion and lower advanced payments received for future module sales partially offset by higher cash receipts from modules sold during the year. Capital expenditures were $347 million in the fourth quarter compared to $286 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in 2023 versus $0.9 million in 2022. Now I'll turn the call back to Mark to provide a business and strategy update. Mark Widmar : All right. Thank you, Alex. A word about overall market conditions and the policy environment, as we enter 2024, while we continue to operate from a position of strength, leveraging our point of differentiation and strong contracted backlog, the continuation of Chinese subsidization and dumping practices has caused a significant collapse in cell and module pricing. Last month, Meyer Burger, a European module and cell manufacturer announced that deteriorating market conditions in Europe resulting from such practices as forcing them to prepare for shuttering module assembly in Germany, exemplifying the challenges to the EU stated goal of creating a self-sustaining renewable manufacturing industry. In India, sudden and significant reduction in cell pricing in the non-domestic content market segment has blunted the efficacy of the country's measures to address Chinese supply chain imports, distorting market pricing in the country and disincentivizing the ability of local suppliers to help achieve India's ambition to create broad domestic manufacturing to serve its domestic market. And here in the U. S., notwithstanding the U.S. Department of Commerce's general determination of antidumping and countervailing duty circumvention by four Southeast Asia countries, the continued record level of cell and module imports from these regions poses a threat to the current administration's ambitions of scaling and securing a robust onshore solar manufacturing base. In light of the current and forecasted state of oversupply in these markets and the resulting headwinds to the ability of domestic manufacturers to scale, we call upon governments and policymakers to either reinforce the measures already enacted or move expeditiously to take action. For instance, here in the U.S., we have long taken the position that the Section 201 Safeguard Bifacial Exemption simply opened the door for a multi gigawatt scale crystalline silicon product to have unfettered access to the American solar market, threatening U.S. Solar manufacturing. Indeed a recent report released by the U.S. International Trade Commission noted that a number of commenters cited the bifacial exclusion along with the 2022 executive order temporary blocking the U.S. Department of Commerce for imposing new tariffs on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam as leading to increased availability of foreign made solar panels. We therefore advocate as the administration undergoes its current evaluation of the 201 tariffs that it closes this market distorting bifacial exemption which has been exploited to eviscerate the intent of these measures to safeguard the domestic industry. In addition with respect to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which address the scourge of utilizing forced labor within the solar supply chain. We similarly advocate for custom and border protection to utilize all of the tools in its toolbox to ensure a comprehensive enforcement strategy of law already on the books and to ensure that regardless of which port product is shipped into, the legal requirements in place are consistently enforced. In India, while the Approved List of Module Manufacturers or ALMM has been effective in incentivizing domestic manufacturing investment passes in the application of this law and the related impact to domestic pricing have put progress at risk. We are heartened that the ALMM waivers currently in place are expected to expire at the end of Q1 and would encourage the federal government of India to not grant such waivers in the future and to also consider expanding the ALMM equivalent requirements to cell manufacturing. These actions we believe will foster India's ambitions of reducing their dependency on the Chinese solar supply chain and in our view incentivize further capital investment in this country. Turning to the EU, while we are pleased with this month's recent development to establish the Net Zero Industry Act, which will prioritize permitting and funding for technologies deemed necessary to help the EU achieve its goal of making the region climate neutral by 2050 much work remains to be done. As we have continuously stated, investment in local manufacturing can only scale when sufficient measures are in place to ensure a long-term consistent level playing field. Such measures require addressing loopholes and trade policies that create the current situation where an oversupply of Chinese modules is being sold at artificially low prices as well as the harmful impacts of the use of forced labor. First Solar has demonstrated the benefits to domestic economies and communities of establishing local solar manufacturing. This is illustrated by an economic impact study commissioned by us and conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette that was released yesterday. This study found that First Solar supported over 16,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs across the U.S. in 2023. This excludes an additional 5,800 construction related jobs tied to our capital investments in 2023. As we scale to an expected 14 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity in the U.S., the analysis forecast that First Solar's operations alone will support approximately 30,000 direct, indirect and reduced jobs across the country by 2026, representing approximately $2.8 billion in annual labor income and $10 billion in total economic output to the 2026 U.S. economy. This study estimates that every First Solar job excluding construction supported six jobs in 2023 and this ratio is forecasted to increase to 7.3 jobs by 2026. We believe this data defines in tangible terms the value that domestic solar manufacturing delivers to the U.S. economy and should provide a basis for bipartisan political support to establish and maintain the policies and trade measures necessary to provide a domestic solar supply chain and a level playing field. We now turn to slide seven to examine our pipeline. Despite the current oversupply of Chinese modules and loopholes and trade policies in our key markets, our pipeline of potential bookings remain robust as reflected on slide seven. Total bookings opportunity stands at 66.5 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 600 megawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid to late stage opportunities decreased by approximately 500 megawatts to 32 gigawatts and includes 23.2 gigawatts in North America, 8.5 gigawatts in India and 0.3 gigawatts in the EU. Included within our mid to late stage pipeline are 3.8 gigawatts opportunities that have contracted subject to CP Presidents, which includes 1.1 gigawatts in India. Given the shorter timeframe between contracting and product delivery in India relative to other markets, we would not expect the same multiyear contracted commitments that we are currently seeing in the United States. As a reminder, signed contracts in India are not recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. Turning to slide eight, we are pleased with our progress of our Ohio capacity expansions and new Alabama manufacturing facility, which are expected to be completed and begin commercial shipments in the first and second halves of the year respectively. Once these projects are completed, we expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity, approximately half of which is forecasted to be local in the U.S. Our new Louisiana facility is also on track and is expected to commence commercial operations in late 2025, bringing our expected total nameplate capacity to over 25 gigawatts by the end of 2026 with 14 gigawatts in the U.S. As a reflection of this expansion roadmap and continued optimization of the existing fleet, we have summarized our expected exit nameplate capacity in production for 2024 through 2026 on this slide. Our strategic expansion of manufacturing capacity in the U.S. which is supported by an extensive domestic value chain enables our customers' efforts to begin from to benefit from the ITC and production tax credit domestic content bonuses under the Inflation Reduction Act. The resulting demand for First Solar's American made solar technologies combined with the eligibility of our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities for Section 45X tax credits is expected to contribute significantly to our financial performance in the coming years. In addition to progressing our manufacturing expansion plans, we expect 2024 to be a foundational year from the point of view of accelerating our R&D efforts in pursuit of our goal to develop and commercialize the next generation of photovoltaics. As previously noted, in addition to a new perovskite development line, we expect to commission our Ohio R&D Innovation Center this year. Located near our existing Perrysburg manufacturing facility and covering an area of approximately 1.3 million square feet, it will feature a hi-tech pilot manufacturing line allowing for the production of full size prototypes of thin film and tandem PV modules. This center will allow us to create an R&D sandbox separate from our manufacturing operations, which we expect will accelerate without taking manufacturing mission critical tools offline which would impact throughput and cost. To close, as I mentioned at our recent Analyst Day, we established a goal to exit this decade stronger than we entered it. Reflecting on our progress, we ended 2023 in a stronger position than we began it, with a record contracted backlog, a significant pipeline of booking opportunities and continued robust demand in our core markets despite some of the current policy landscape challenges. We entered 2024 with new capacity of our most advantaged Series 7 product coming online, increased R&D investment and capabilities and continued momentum across the business driven by a focus on our points of differentiation and a balanced business model focused on growth, liquidity and profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Alex, who will discuss our 2024 outlook and guidance. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Before discussing our financial guidance, I'd like to reiterate three themes from our recent Analyst Day related to our growth and investment thesis, our approach to our backlog and bookings and our expansion into India. Firstly, from a growth and investment thesis perspective, we continue to focus on differentiation and our guided line approach to our business model balances growth, profitability and liquidity. This decision-making framework informs our long-term strategic direction. It guided our strategy to exit the systems business at the end of the last decade and significantly expand our module manufacturing business, evidenced in a doubling of nameplate capacity from 2021 to 2023 and the forecasted increase in nameplate capacity of over 50% in 2023 to 2026. This scaling capacity is supported by optionality in our R&D road map across energy attributes including efficiency, degradation, temperature coefficient and bifaciality. We've gone from deploying prototypes of early bifacial CadTel modules at a test facility in 2021 to converting our lead line at the end of 2023 with commercial deployment across a significant portion of our fleet plan for 2024. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect to be in production of our first commercial pure modules on our lead line in Ohio. As it relates to contracting this volume, we continue to prioritize certainty. Our reported backlog, which includes U.S. and Rest of World bookings with our typical contractual security provisions, but excludes contracts signed in India and less backed by 100% liquid security is made up of two types of contracts. Those relates to a specific asset or project and frameworks, which are typically larger, multi-year, and therefore often have less certainty over delivery timing. Common across these contracts is a fixed price structure, which may include adjusters for technology improvements, and which typically include adjusters for bin class, freight risk, and commodity risks. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 95% of the megawatts in our backlog had some form of freight protection, and approximately 85% had some form of steel and/or aluminium commodity cost protection. As a reminder, a limited number of our contracts contain a termination for convenience provision, often related to customer regulatory requirements, or as a portion of large multi-year framework from this, which generally requires substantial advance notice to be invoked and features a contractually required termination payment to us. This payment is generally set at a substantial percentage of the contract value and backstopped by some form of security. As of today's call, the percentage of megawatts in our contracted backlog that had a termination for convenience closed with an associated termination payment obligation is roughly equivalent to that given on our Analyst Day in September of 2023. Note, given this provision is one of many deal terms that is negotiated with our customers in the process of a module sale, we do not expect to provide updates on this metric. On our earnings call in February of 2022, we stated that as we significantly increased our nameplate capacity, we believe that this anticipated growth would generate significant contribution margin to drive operating margin expansion. In 2023, that thesis was validated as we saw significant year-over-year operating margin expansion. As we continue our capacity growth we expect to continue to see operating margin expansion in 2024 as reflected in our guidance provided today. Secondly, as it relates to our contracted backlog, excluding India we remain cumulatively oversold through 2026. This over-allocation position is deliberate, provides us resilience to the uncertain timing of delivery inherent in some of our larger framework contracts, a natural tendency for delay in the project development process, as well as the potential for incremental supply as we start up and ramp new factories. The further out the delivery timeframe, the more comfortable we are with over allocation. The closer we get to delivery dates, and as we enter any given year and undertake our annual planning process, the more we look to ensure that demand is able to be met with available supply. As of late Q4 2023, we have not seen significant customer requests for schedule changes beyond the typical daily and weekly balancing that occurs in our supply-demand forecasting. As we concluded our planning process of 2024 through the first two months of the year, we have seen some requests from customers to shift delivery volume timing out as a function of project development delays. As we stated previously, including on our Analyst Day, we will work with our customers to optimize their project schedules, including moving delivery dates in the short and medium term where possible, balanced by the constraints of our production and shipment needs, including selling our full production in 2024, which we continue to expect to do. Our contractual provisions underlie and govern these relationships and discussions. In certain situations, our approach to overselling could expose us contractually, should we be unable to manage our over-allocated position. This is where the strength of our long-standing customer relationships is key, providing flexibility not just for our customers, but also often for first-holder delivery timelines. Given our supply-demand balancing so far and our ability in the near term to supply modules from India to the U.S., we do not forecast any damages associated with overallocations in 2024. Contractual provisions also protect us in the event of long-term customer issues or disputes. For example, we were recently notified by a corporate customer where they are experiencing significant delays to their project. And based on this and their current position of financial distress, they do not intend to take delivery of 381 megawatts of modules scheduled for delivery in 2024. We are working with this customer to optimize the outcome for both the customer and First Solar, but in this and other similar circumstances, we will continue to enforce our contractual rights to termination penalties or other damages in the event of their contractual breach. As previously discussed on recent earnings calls and at our Analyst Day, we believe our approach to forward contracting has been validated in the past through multiple pricing and supply demand cycles in the industry. We've also previously stated that we expect the pace of bookings to slow after two record contracting years. Our current backlog cumulatively oversold through 2026, with bookings extending to the end of the decade, provides us optionality in periods of pricing and policy uncertainty. Put simply, if we did not book any more deals by the end of this year, we would remain sold out two years forward through 2025 and 2026. We do not expect this to be the case, and we will continue to contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and value our differentiation, as reflected in our 2.3 gigawatts of booking since the previous earnings call. But given the significant variables in the policy environment that Mark discussed earlier, as well as the uncertainty around the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections and their potential impact on the renewable sector, we expect to take advantage of this position of strength and be highly selected in our contracting in 2024. Finally, as it relates to India, from a contracting perspective, as of our Q3 earnings call in October, we had 1.7 gigawatts of signed contracts within our mid-to-late-stage pipeline. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. As of today's call, that number is 1.1 gigawatts, following a 600-megawatt default by a customer who was recently delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. We are seeking to enforce our contractual rights under this contract and are currently seeking to recover the contractual termination payments owed to us. From an ASP perspective, the temporary suspension of the ALMM policy that Mark discussed earlier is having a short-term negative impact on domestic market ASPs and gross margin, which is reflected in our 2024 guidance. We believe the expected reinstatement of the ALMM at the end of Q1, together with the ability to serve the domestic content market segment, which we are uniquely positioned to address given our vertical integration, provides a market opportunity with a gross margin profile excluding the Section 45X tax credit benefit comparable to the fleet average given the lower production costs in our Chennai facility. With this context in mind, I'll next discuss the assumptions included in our 2024 financial guidance. Please turn to slide nine. As referenced in 2023, we have effectively completed the transition back to a module-only company. We continue to have certain remaining risks, liabilities, indemnities, warranty obligations, accounts payable, accounts receivable, earn-outs, cash collection, dispute resolution, and other legacy involvement related to our former systems business. Consistent with 2023 reporting, we no longer provide segment-specific guidance, but shall in the future note any significant impact from the other segment to our consolidated financials. As it relates to growth, our factory expansions and upgrades remain on schedule to increase our expected global nameplate capacity to 25 gigawatts by year-end 2026. In 2024, growth-related costs are expected to impact operating income by approximately 125 million to 155 million. This comprises startup expenses of 85 million to 95 million, primarily incurred in connection with our new factory in Alabama, and estimated ramp costs of 40 million to 60 million at our factories in India, Ohio, and Alabama. We anticipate these expansions and upgrades will contribute meaningfully plans in 2025 and beyond. Operationally, in 2024, we're expected to produce 15.6 to 16 gigawatts of modules. From a sold perspective, we expect to sell 15.6 to 16.3 gigawatts, of which 5.8 to 6.1 gigawatts is produced in the U.S. And 2 to 2.2 gigawatts is assumed to be domestic sales in India. For the full-year, we expect to recognize a fleet ASP sold of approximately 28.2 cents per watt. This includes India domestic sold volume, a non-India base ASP, roughly in line with our expectations from our September Analyst Day, and the benefit of certain technology, commodity, and freight adders. From a cost perspective, full-year 2024 cost bought produced is forecast to be in the range of 18.7 to 18.9 cents per watt, an approximately 2% to 3% improvement versus 2023. This is driven by expected improvements in throughput, yield, and reduced inbound freight and variable costs, as well as the benefit of an increased mix of lower cost India production, partially offset by increased costs related to the rollout of our bifacial products. As it relates to cost per watt sold, we are forecasting fleet average sales rate, warehousing, ramp, and other period costs of approximately 3 cents per watt, resulting in a full-year 2024 cost per watt sold reduction of approximately 7% versus the prior year. As mentioned on our Analyst Day, approximately three-quarters of the cost of our module is de-risked, given approximately one-third of the cost is fixed, and approximately two-thirds of the variable costs are subject to forward contracting, long-term agreements, or have contractual mechanisms to pass costs through to our customers in the event that these costs change materially. Additionally, over 95% of our backlog has some form of sales rate protection, leading to significant gross margin visibility. From a capital structure perspective, our strong balance sheet has been and remains a strategic differentiator, enabling us to both weather periods of volatility, as well as providing flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, including funding our Series 6 and Series 7 growth. We ended 2023 in a strong liquidity position, and coupled with forecasted operating cash flows from module sales, cash from the sale of our 2023 Section 45X tax credits and anticipated module order prepayments, we expect to be able to finance our currently announced capital programs without requiring external financing. As it relates to our 2024 Section 45X credits, we are forecasting to elect direct payments and are therefore assuming no discount to the value of these credits for a sale to a third-party, but will continue to evaluate options and valuations for earlier monetization. I'll now cover the full-year 2024 guidance ranges on slide 10. Our net sales guidance is between 4.4 billion and 4.6 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between 2 billion and 2.1 billion, or approximately 46%, which includes 1 billion to 1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits and 40 million to 60 million of ramp costs. SG&A expenses are expected to total $170 million to $180 million versus $197 million in 2023, demonstrating our ability to leverage our largely fixed operating cost structure while expanding production. R&D expenses are expected to total $200 million to $210 million, versus $152 million in 2023. R&D expenses are increasing primarily due to commencing operations at our R&D Innovation Center and perovskite development line, and the expectation of adding headcount to our R&D team to further invest in advanced research initiatives. SG&A and R&D expense combined is expected to total $370 million to $390 million. Total operating expenses, which include $85 million to $95 million of production start-up expense, are expected to be between $455 million to $485 million. Operating income is expected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, applying an operating to 35%, and is inclusive of 125 million to 155 million of combined ramp costs and plant startup expenses, and 1 billion to 1.05 billion of Section 45X tax credits. Compared to an operating margin of 26% in 2023, this year-over-year increase demonstrates how we expect to leverage our business model against a largely fixed SG&A cost structure, which shows the value of growth in driving incremental contribution margin and operating margin expansion. Turning to non-operating items, we expect interest income, interest expense, and other income to net the $35 million to $50 million. Fully taxed expenses forecast to be $135 million to $150 million. This results in a full-year 2024 earnings to the business share guidance range of $13 to $14. Note, from an earnings cadence perspective, we expect a net sales and cost of sales profile excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credits of approximately 15% in Q1, 25% in Q2, and 60% in the second-half of the year. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $190 million in Q1, $230 million in Q2, and $600 million in the second-half of the year. With an operating expenses profile roughly evenly split across the year, this results in a forecasted operating income and earnings-to-share profile of approximately 15% in the first quarter, 25% in the second quarter, and 60% in the second-half of the year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to range from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as we progress the construction of our Alabama and Louisiana Series 7 factories, implement throughput upgrades to the fleet, and invest in other R&D-related programs. Approximately two-thirds of our CapEx is associated with capacity expansion, and one-quarter relates to our R&D center and technology replication, with the remainder mostly related to maintenance and logistics. Our year-end 2024 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion. Turning to slide 11, I'll summarize the key messages from today's call. Demand has been solid with 2.3 gigawatts of net bookings since the previous earnings call, leading to a contracted backlog of 80.1 gigawatts. Our opportunity pipeline remained strong, with global opportunity set at 66.5 gigawatts, including mid to late-stage opportunities of 32 gigawatts. We continue to expand our manufacturing capacity, exiting 2023 with 16.6 gigawatts of nameplate capacity, and expect to exit 2026 with approximately 25 gigawatts of nameplate capacity, including approximately 14 gigawatts of nameplate capacity in the U.S. We are, as previously announced, adding a new dedicated R&D facility in Ohio, projected to be operational in the first-half of 2024, which we believe will allow us to optimize technology improvements with significantly less disruption to our commercial manufacturing offerings. Earnings per diluted share was $7.74 in 2023, including the impact of selling our 2023 Section 45X tax credits, and the impairment of our investment in CubicPV above the midpoint of our initial and Q3 updated guidance. We're forecasting full-year 2024 earnings per diluted share of $13 to $14. Finally, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion net of debt, and expect to end 2024 with a cash balance of $900 million to $1.2 billion net of debt. This net cash position together with optionality around monetizing our 2024 Section 45X tax credits places us in a position of strength from which to expand our capacity to invest research, development and technology improvements, pursue other strategic opportunities as we march forward on our journey to lead the world's sustainable energy future. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and over to the questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Moses Sutton, BNP Paribas. Moses Sutton : Hi, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on continued price momentum and its execution. At some point, should we see bookings, I want to say, near zero in a given quarter having -- simply can't book more till time passes naturally, and I think investors think of that? Or conversely, like to eventually lower that ASP into like $0.29 range? It went all the way to $0.32 which was great to see. So, just curious how that dynamic plays through the year? I know you could book some, but what should we expect more precisely? Mark Widmar : Yes, so, I'll take one, I guess. And in terms of -- as Alex included in his remarks, our plan is to be patient. The opportunities are there. You can see it, the pipeline of opportunities that we represent, both mid-to-late and obviously the early-stage pipeline. Separating U.S. from India, you're going to continue to see bookings in India, clearly. As we indicated, we've got a conversion that will happen of those contracted subject to CP. So, that's going to continue on a cadence that you would expect, call it hundreds of megawatts, maybe a gigawatt on any particular quarter to sell through that and to position for 2024. So, you'll see that momentum continuing. As it relates to the U.S., our strategy of being patient is largely how we're going to engage the market in conversations with our customers. I am very happy with the bookings that we showed up with this last quarter, great ASPs, good counterparties, technology adders associated with it. So, and feathered into a period of time that's very constructive for us, so a lot of that volume goes out into '27, '28, and '29, and touches '30 even. So, happy from that standpoint. We've got, right now, we got a short window between now and the next earnings call, so you could see maybe a period of softness there outside of the volume that we would expect to continue to recognize for India. But I've got ongoing commercial conversations right now for north of three gigawatts of bookings here for shipments into the U.S. that are in late-stage negotiations. And actually as this call was ongoing, I got a text that about 10% of that now has been booked, and will reflect in next earnings call. So, the momentum is there, it's available to us. It's how we choose to engage. And our strategy is to try to maintain the ASPs and delivering the certainty that we provide to our customers. There's a lot going on right now when you step back and reflect. There's a whole policy environment and the issues that have to be resolved, and uncertainty, and there's potential change in the administration in D.C., which Alex highlighted as well. And if there was a Republican administration, how would they choose to engage. And there's all kinds of conversations on how they'd think through IRA, sure. But I don't think that they would be any less lenient on the Chinese, and I think they could get more aggressive in the potential trade barriers that our customers are concerned about. And so, they value the certainty of First Solar, and looking to de-risk their projects as far out as they can go. The other thing that's still driving some uncertainty in the marketplace is, as you've seen recently with on an IP standpoint, especially as the market has transitioned to TopCon. Gencos has indicated that they're going to have a strong IP position for TopCon and they're going to enforce that IP. You've seen Maxeon make statements as well that they've got an IP position around TopCon that they're also going to enforce. And as you know, there is a significant transition towards TopCon. So, our customers also have to think through freedom to operate with their counterparties around intellectual properties. So, there is a lot that they have to think through, and there's a lot of uncertainty outside of engaging with First Solar. And so, we'll be disciplined and measured in our negotiations. But I would not at all be surprised that, as we finish out this year, we'll be somewhere around a 1 :1 book to bill, which will add 16 gigawatts or so, that was our shipment profile. I wouldn't be surprised if our bookings is somewhat in that ZIP code. And largely, that would fill out our pocket of opportunity in 2027, so we could exit this year with a comparable backlog that we have right now, and potentially have a very solid position going into through to 2027, and continuing to think about how we book out through the end of the decade. Operator : We'll take the next question from Philip Shen, Roth Capital Partners. Philip Shen : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. First one's on pricing. Great job on the recent bookings ASP at $0.32 almost. And can you talk through the dynamics influencing that pricing? You mentioned a bunch of the earlier, Mark, but I'd love to get a feel for how the customer conversations have inflected. Last year, it was very much an oversupply price decline environment. And recently, a lot of this policy activity has kind of swung back in your favour as it relates to greater UFLPA enforcement or the potential to do one bifacial exemption being removed. Can you just talk through that customer conversation, and how that may have inflected recently? And then also, do you expect that pricing momentum to remain steady through '24 or is there even potential that it could go higher or do you think there is risk that it could go lower? The second here is around module volume, that you talked about there's a customer that can't take delivery of 381 megawatts of product. Are checks on this suggests there could be as much as 1.5 gigawatts floating around. And so, how many megawatts do you expect the market to transact in the secondary market, if you will, in '24? So, I know it's not your risk ultimately, but you do have to manage it at some level, and your customers, ultimately, have to deal with it. But -- and yes, you should have protections, but it's something that can be an issue to understand better as well. So, thanks, Mark. Mark Widmar : Yes, so let me -- I'll start with your second one, and then I'll go back to the first one. Look, this 380 megawatts was to -- think of it almost as a one-off transaction that I think we booked two, three years ago, can't remember the exact timeframe it was for. And we specifically stated in the prepared remarks, it was for a corporate customer who basically was going to use it for self-generation, self-consumption, right, and then -- and ultimately was looking potentially not just from -- to potentially that were just beyond just the raw form of the electricity generation that it would provide. That customer has gone into some financial challenges that they're having to deal with. And so those megawatts are an obligation to the customer, we won't force the rights on the contract. We will also work with the customer to re-contract that if we -- if that opportunity is available to us. If not, then there's an obligation for them to take delivery, and then to pay for that. That particular project, it is a project that is cited in a state of permitting and I believe has an interconnection. That project asset itself is being marketed right now. And we'll see how successful that is to the extent that that transaction does happen, then the modules will go along with it, they'll be an assignment with -- given our consent, and we'll support that type of consent, again with the spirit of honouring -- enforcing rights underneath our contract. So, that one is that issue. So, to the other question, because I know you've asked this a couple of times about markets -- product that's out in the secondary market. There are customers who are challenged right now from a development standpoint as it relates to interconnection positions, it's something that you are very well aware of. Our contracts and our customers are aware of the fact that they need to take delivery of those modules. And when I'm talking about this, this is hundreds of megawatts. This is not a lot of volume in 2024. Their option is to find a warehouse and to put it into a warehouse or potentially they could look to try to transact with a third-party. We'll try to find the right possible outcome with our customers. We always have worked in the spirit of let's figure out a solution that can work, so, aware of that. I don't believe it will have any significant impact on our ability to continue to book any volumes that may be available in 2024, given schedule movements and those types of things. But we'll have to keep an eye on it. But I also just want to make sure that the one deal that we talked about was unique in its circumstances and is it necessary to reflect it with maybe the other opportunities that you were hearing about in the marketplace. As it relates to pricing and ASP and momentum, policy is clearly -- toggles back and forth and trends up and down, and right now, I think there is a lot of uncertainty from that standpoint. But the other thing I want to continue to try to emphasize is the value of certainty of First Solar and the value of our relationship and our value proposition. I was having a conversation with one of our largest partners just last week. And they couldn't be happier to be partnering with First Solar. And the attributes we're talking about, the strength of the technology, the certainty of First Solar, but it also gets into the responsible solar aspects as well and our carbon footprint and our water usage and our energy payback and our circular economy. And when you -- that's inherent to their value proposition that they're selling to their contracted off-take customers, like data centers, who value that as well. This work that we're doing around economic impact, no different than that, I mean, creating American jobs, and we being closely tethered to that, supporting, and investing back into America and American manufacturing, American technology, all that plays to our strengths. And so, yes, policy environment is helpful right now, but these other attributes are almost equally as important. And our partner said, basically, look, I know I may have to pay a little bit more for First Solar, but when I look at the brand and the certainty and the value proposition that they're creating, more than happy to do that. And this is a counterparty that is almost 80 plus percent, 100% sole source into First Solar, and we've got a deep relationship and multi-gigawatts of opportunity still in front of us. And I don't see this as a unique one-off. This is generally the engagement and conversations that we're having with our customers. Alex Bradley : And so, you mentioned if what probably the pricing would stay steady, there's definitely some elasticity of demand related to pricing, which is why we want to be disciplined and why the position of strength that we put ourselves in is so important. We have no need to go out and chase deals. As I mentioned on the call, we could book nothing between now and the end of the year and still find ourselves two years forward sold out. If there is uncertainty in the market, we can afford to step back and therefore we can manage to some degree some of that price erosion. So, we'll continue to work with people that value the attributes that Mark brings, and therefore I think you'll see slower bookings, lower pace of bookings at pricing that we find accessible in the long-term. Clearly, if we wanted to sell a lot more and drop pricing, that would happen, but that's not the strategy. Mark Widmar : Yes, and I think we just tether back to, look, if we can achieve a one-to-one book-to-bill this year, largely sell through our open position in 2027, I think that would be a great result and position the company very well as we exit 2024. Operator : And everyone, that is all the time we have for questions today. This does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its first quarter 2024 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on our website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide business, strategy and policy updates. Alex will discuss our bookings, pipeline, quarterly financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call for questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with our start to 2024 with good operating performance, selective year-to-date bookings of 2.7 gigawatts with an ASP over $0.31 per watt excluding adjusters or $0.327 per watt assuming the realization of technology adjusters and solid financial performance. We're also pleased with the developing foundations to enable our long-term goal of exiting this decade in a stronger position than we entered it, from increasing production of our most advantaged Series 7 module to expanding our manufacturing footprint, to the building of an R&D innovation center and perovskite development line that is expected to enable development of the next generation of disruptive solar technology. We are focused on the future of differentiation and sustainable growth. But while we continue to play the long game, we must acknowledge the current environment in the solar manufacturing industry, which remains in a state of heightened volatility driven by intentional structural overcapacity in China. As we previously said, our ability to play this long game is a direct result of our differentiated technology and business model. From a technological perspective, the contrast is clear between our unique proprietary cadmium telluride semiconductor technology and highly commoditized crystalline silicon modules. This difference has become increasingly apparent in light of the recently announced disputes concerning alleged infringement of TOPCon cell technology and intellectual property rights, which cast out on numerous crystalline silicon producers having the freedom to legally manufacture and sell this technology. From a business model and growth perspective, we are once again reminded of the value of our balanced approach to growth, liquidity and profitability. According to reporting, large Chinese solar companies have warned of potential quality and reliability issues as manufacturers cut corners and the impact of the current oversupply environment and associated financial stress on R&D and innovation. By contrast, we continue to invest. We are on track to commission our R&D innovation center and a perovskite development line in Ohio in the second half of this year, representing a combined investment of nearly $0.5 billion. And we continue to optimize our products for energy efficiency and cost. In the face of overcapacity, the average large Chinese solar manufacturing facility reportedly had a record-low capacity utilization rate of 23% in February of this year. In contrast, supported by our large contracted backlog, our facilities were operating near nameplate capacity in the first quarter of this year. The Chinese solar industry has engaged in a race to the bottom with irrationally low market-distorting pricing that has caused even Chinese companies to call for intervention by the Chinese government to manage the pricing environment and end the financial hardship this is causing them. By contrast, we remain focused on a highly selective approach to forward contracting that provides optionality and healthy ASPs. We are not immune to the broader ramifications of the Chinese solar business model. However, we continue to focus on our points of differentiation, which aim to provide some resiliency in light of current industry challenges. We're also focused on policy and trade drivers that can counter anticompetitive and abusive market behaviors. There should be no doubt, we invite competition and free trade. All we continue to seek is that the competition and trade are practiced on a fair and level playing field. We believe this approach will help us to drive growth, navigate industry volatility and deliver enduring shareholder value. On Slide 3, I will share some highlights from the first quarter. From a commercial perspective, we continued our selective approach to building backlog underpinned by our cumulatively oversold position through 2026. Since our last earnings call approximately 9 weeks ago, we have booked 854 megawatts with an ASP of $0.301 per watt excluding adjusters where applicable. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 2.7 gigawatts with an average ASP of $0.313 per watt excluding adjusters or $0.327 per watt assuming the realization of technology adjusters.  Our total contracted backlog now stands at 78.3 gigawatts with orders stretching through 2030. From a manufacturing perspective, we are pleased with our solid Q1 performance, including producing a record 3.6 gigawatts of modules as a result of our relentless focus on manufacturing excellence. From a technology perspective, we are pleased with our CuRe module field test and have completed the UL and IEC certification process. We continue to anticipate launching CuRe at our lead line factory in Ohio in Q4 of this year. In parallel to preparing for launch, we continue to make progress on technical solutions that could enable accelerating CuRe's replication across our factories at a lower CapEx than assumed at our recent Analyst Day. Now Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our first quarter 2024 financial results. I would like to highlight our ability to deliver strong performance in a market challenged by Chinese oversupply, which, in our view, validates our approach to long-term forward contracting. This led to first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.20 and a quarter end net cash balance of $1.4 billion. Moving to Slide 4. Our growth plans remain on track. The expansion of our Perrysburg, Ohio manufacturing footprint is expected to be completed, and commercial shipments are expected to begin before the end of the second quarter. Construction activity at our new facility in Alabama is complete, and the first tools are now being installed in preparation for the expected start of commercial shipments in the second half of this year. Our new Louisiana facility is also on track with the start in commercial operations expected in late 2025. Internationally, our India facility is continuing to ramp. And we're proud that the first Indian-made Series 7 modules have been deployed in the field. We therefore expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity and 2026 with over 25 gigawatts of nameplate capacity. All of this capacity is available to serve the U.S. market with over half of our capacity physically located in the U.S. Additionally, we are on track to commission the previously mentioned R&D projects in Ohio in the second half of this year, which will comprise a perovskite development line and a new R&D innovation center at our Perrysburg campus. The innovation center features a high-tech CadTel pilot line, which we expect will accelerate our development activities and bring capabilities for full-size prototyping of thin-film and tandem PV modules. At our Analyst Day in September 2023, we talked about the need to create a disruptive, transformative technology platform that balances energy efficiency and costs. We believe that these investments in R&D will help accelerate our cycles of innovation, optimize our technology road map and reinforce our position of strength through technology leadership. I'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss our bookings, pipeline and financials. Alexander Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Moving on Slide 5. As of December 31, 2023, our contracted backlog totaled 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion. Through March 31, 2024, we entered into an additional 2.7 gigawatts of contracts and recognized 2.7 gigawatts of volumes sold, resulting in a total backlog of 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.4 billion, which implies an ASP of approximately $0.299 per watt excluding adjusters. As we previously stated, given our diminished available supply, the long-dated time frame into which we're now selling, the need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security and other key contractual terms and uncertainty related to the policy environment and the upcoming U.S. election cycle, we expect to take advantage of our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year. We will continue to forward contract with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value our point of differentiation. The substantial portion of our overall backlog includes the opportunity to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters if we are able to realize achievements within our current technology road map as of the expected timing of delivery for the product. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 40.2 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which, if fully realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.5 billion or approximately $0.01 per watt, the majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2027. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog, both the ultimate module being delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP under the sales contract upward or downwards, and for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. As reflected on Slide 6, our total pipeline of potential bookings remained strong with bookings opportunities of 72.8 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 6.3 gigawatts in the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunity decreased by approximately 2.6 gigawatts to 29.4 gigawatts and now includes 25.8 gigawatts in North America and 3.3 gigawatts in India. Included within our mid- to late-stage pipeline are 3.7 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted subject to conditions precedent, which includes 1 gigawatt in India. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we have received full security against the offtake. We're seeing meaningful increases in demand expectations driven in part by data center load growth. According to McKinsey, U.S. data center power consumption is expected to reach 35 gigawatts annually by 2030, and much of this growth is supplied by renewable energy given that hyperscalers like Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are committed to 24/7 use of carbon-free energy. We believe that First Solar is strongly positioned to supply this emerging sector given our advantaged technology and more sustainable product. Slide 7, I'll cover our financial results for the first quarter. Net sales in the first quarter were $794 million, a decrease of $365 million compared to the fourth quarter. Decrease in net sales was driven by an expected historical seasonal reduction in the Q1 volume of modules sold. Gross margin was 44% in the first quarter compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of modules sold from our U.S. factories, which qualify for Section 45X tax credits, partially offset by higher warehousing and logistics costs in India and the U.S. SG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $104 million in the first quarter, a decrease of approximately $7 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower professional fees as we incurred certain costs to facilitate the sale of our 2023 Section 45X credits during the prior quarter, lower incentive compensation and the receipt of an R&D grant at our factories in Ohio. These reductions were partially offset by higher production start-up expenses for our Alabama factory and Ohio manufacturing footprint expansions as well as the reversal of certain credit losses in the prior quarter due to improved collections for our accounts receivables. Our first quarter operating income was $243 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $91 million, ramp costs of $12 million, production start-up expense of $15 million and share-based compensation expense of $7 million. The increase in other income and expense was primarily driven by the prior quarter impairment of our strategic investment in CubicPV. We recorded tax expense of $19 million in the first quarter compared to $27 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease in tax expense was largely driven by excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation awards and lower pretax income. Combination of the aforementioned items led to first quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.20. Next, turn to Slide 8 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana and our Ohio capacity expansion, partially offset by operating cash flows from our module segment. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $620 million, an increase of $60 million from the fourth quarter as a result of additional working capital facilities to support the ramp of our new India plant. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to $1.4 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows from operations were $268 million in the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $413 million during the period. Continuing on Slide 9. Our full year 2024 volumes sold and P&L guidance is unchanged from our previous earnings and guidance call in late February. We're increasing our capital expenditures forecast by $0.1 billion with the intention of accelerating the CuRe conversion at our Vietnam facilities as well as at our third Perrysburg facility and with a view to advancing global fleet replication by more than 1 year from our assumptions at our recent Analyst Day, which could drive incremental upside to the current estimate of additional revenue realizable through technology adjusters referenced earlier in the call. Our year-end 2024 net cash balance guidance range has been revised due to 4 factors : our selective accommodation of customer schedule shift requests, potential sale by a customer of a U.S. project development portfolio, our strategic approach to new bookings and higher CapEx. Firstly, as noted on our previous call, we have seen some requests from customers to shift delivery volume timing out as a function of project development delays. We continue to work with our customers to optimize delivery schedules for their contracted volumes to the extent we are able to accommodate. Secondly, consistent with the reports that some energy project developers are coming under investor pressure to pursue returns commensurate with those currently prevalent in fossil project development, they may therefore be examining their renewable procurement positions. We have indications that a customer is expecting to sell their U.S. solar development portfolio, and we understand that the potential [ purge ] of these assets is a First Solar customer with an existing module framework agreement. We expect that the development time lines for the projects within this portfolio will be delayed, including as a result of the sales process, pushing construction schedules out of 2024. Because the potential [ purge ] of these assets in an existing customer with a framework agreement covering the revised construction schedules and a portion of our backlog the selling customer is among unlimited contracts with a termination for convenience rights, we expect that this right will be exercised in connection with this portfolio sale. As discussed on previous earnings calls, if this termination for convenience right is exercised, we will be owed a termination payment. We'd look to reallocate or resell these modules. Between selectively accommodating customer timing optimization requests and the expected termination for convenience by the aforementioned portfolio selling developer customer, we now expect a greater concentration of the shipments and sold volume in the second half of the year to be in Q4 versus Q3. As a result of this back ending of deliveries, we expect the timing of some cash collection previously assumed in Q4 2024 to now occur in Q1 of 2025. Thirdly, relating to the revision of our year-end 2024 net cash balance guidance range, as a function of our highly selective approach to bookings, we're forecasting a reduction in assumed cash deposits associated with new bookings in 2024. And fourthly, as previously mentioned, we're forecasting higher CapEx associated with our intention to accelerate CuRe conversion at our Vietnam and our third Perrysburg facilities. So taken together, the combination of higher year-end accounts receivable balance due to accommodating customer timing optimization requests, the expanded termination for convenience by the aforementioned portfolio selling developer customer and reduced deposits from new bookings due to our highly selective approach to bookings as well as the increased CapEx due to the CuRe conversion in Vietnam and Perrysburg results in an updated year-end 2024 net cash balance guide of $600 million to $900 million. From an earnings cadence perspective, we expect our net sales and cost of sales profile, excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credit, to be approximately 35% to 40% in the first half of the year and 60% to 65% in the second half of the year. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $400 million in the first half of the year, approximately $620 million in the second half of the year and then operating expense profile roughly evenly split across the year. This results in a forecasted earnings per diluted share profile of approximately 35% to 40% in the first half of the year and 60% to 65% in the second half of the year. Now I hand the call back to Mark to provide an update on policy. Mark Widmar : Okay. Turning to Slide 10. As we stated in the past, we believe the Inflation Reduction Act represents America's first durable solar industrial strategy. And if implemented with the whole of government commitment to onshoring, together with strong and consistent enforcement of trade laws, it also has the potential to dismantle China's dominating influence over solar manufacturing value chains. Quite simply, the IRA paves a viable pathway for the U.S. to secure supply of critical clean energy technologies, enabling America's energy independence while capturing the value of our economy and creating well-paying, enduring jobs. At the same time and also as previously stated, while we are not the only American solar manufacturer to come in existence at the end of the last century, the grim reality is that as a consequence of China's strategic objective to dominate the solar industry, we're the only one at scale to remain today. For the IRA to achieve one of its intended purposes, which is to spur U.S. manufacturing to the scale required to support the country's energy independence and climate goals, we must ensure that more companies that are aligned with the U.S. ambitions and are committed to fair competition and innovation can scale, compete and prosper. The purpose of the IRA will not be achieved under current unsustainable market conditions. The relentlessness of the Chinese subsidization and dumping strategy have caused a significant collapse in cell and module pricing and threatens the viability of many manufacturers who may never be able to get off the ground or have the ability to finance and start up the growth of their operations. Given this unfortunate reality, together with our role as a market leader and the Western Hemisphere's largest solar module manufacturer, we have joined an alliance of 7 solar manufacturing companies comprising the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, which last week filed a set of antidumping and countervailing petitions with the U.S. International Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Commerce to investigate unfair trade practices from factories in 4 Belt and Road Initiative countries in Southeast Asia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, that are injuring the U.S. solar industry. This action takes place against the backdrop of growing momentum on the part of current U.S. administration to broadly address structural overcapacity across a range of industries in China. The administration's leadership in tackling this wide-ranging issue is remarkable. And in the past few weeks, we have heard senior members of the administration, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and White House Climate Adviser John Podesta, state in no uncertain terms that the President intends to act to level the playing field for American manufacturing. We welcome the actions focused on solar supply chains, including the reported potential withdrawal of the Section 201 bifacial exemption and the pending expiration on the moratorium on tariffs related to anti-circumvention findings. These are clear actions that deliver on the President's intent. The context of our decision to support the petition starts with China's role in the global solar market. That country's long history of egregious subsidies, dumping of modules at prices believed to be below their cost, creation of structural overcapacity, engagement and circumvention of measures designed to address these factors and other unfair trade practices have intentionally distorted markets around the globe, causing a significant decline in solar prices and denying international competitors access to a level playing field. As Secretary Yellen herself has recently said, \"China's overcapacity distorts global prices and production patterns and hurts American firms and workers.\" China ended 2023 with more than twice the solar manufacturing capacity that was deployed worldwide last year, had record-low factory capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2024 and, despite these market-distorting factors, is still expected to add 500 to 600 gigawatts of new capacity this year. With China expected to exit 2024 with sufficient capacity to meet global demand through 2032, it appears that the overcapacity is not a miscalculation but an intentional feature of the Chinese government strategy to dominate clean energy supply chains. Notably, the 4 Southeast Asian countries in question account for 75% of U.S. solar imports in 2023 and were responsible for an approximately 140% increase in exports to the U.S. in the 18 months following the passage of the IRA compared to the 18 months preceding August of 2022. While the current environment, if allowed to persist, will provide a short-term pricing benefit to developers, allowing these practices to continue denies non-Chinese solar manufacturers the opportunities to scale and compete on a level playing field while multiplying installers and developers exposure to the risk of over-concentrated supply chains. A word about the impact on the potential tariffs resulting from this case on module pricing. While some may choose to reference triple-figure tariff rates and claiming that these types of rates will cause severe disruption in achieving our deployment goals, the reality is far different. Currently, Chinese AD and CVD rates range from 15% to 50% for most cooperating companies. Secondly, projects should not be affected as historical module pricing has already been baked into those project economics. Finally, from a supply standpoint, there is, contrary to the view expressed by some industry participants, more than sufficient product available to service current and anticipated U.S. demand through the combination of currently warehoused modules, fairly traded imports and the capacity of Western manufacturers such as First Solar. As noted earlier, we expect to exit 2024 with over 21 gigawatts and 2026 with over 25 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity, all of which is available to serve the U.S. market. Time and again, we have heard about the detrimental effects of enforcing trade laws on the books of deployment. And yet time and again, we see annual records set for solar deployment in this country. In our view, the real risk for U.S. solar deployment comes from the long-term detrimental effects of allowing China's unfair trade practices to continue, which could result in a decimated domestic solar manufacturing base, ceding all pricing power and a complete control of supply chain distribution to a highly adversarial nation. This represents a strategic risk to developers of solar assets, clean energy transition and the U.S. energy independence and economic prosperity. The U.S. energy independence isn't just about producing electricity at home. It's about having the supply chain and R&D for future advancements at our nation's disposal as well. Historic once-in-a-lifetime policies like the IRA, while transformative of our country's energy transition and our industry, are not enough to deliver independence due to China's unfair trade practices. We believe the IRA must work in conjunction with strong and effective trade measures that level the playing field for investments it catalyzes. We must think of government policy in terms of a three-legged stool. The first leg is industrial policy such as a 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which incentivizes investment in American manufacturing. This provides solar, wind and battery storage and another manufacturers momentum needed to scale domestically, drive down costs and spur cycles of innovation to maintain American\u2019s technology leadership. The second leg is demand and demand side drivers. In the U.S., demand continues to grow. But the domestic content bonus enhances this growth by creating a crucial parallel demand side driver to incentivize purchasing the output of these American factories through the introduction of a bonus to the investment or production tax credit accessed by solar generation asset owners if projects procure domestically made content, including solar panels. The third leg is a level playing field that addresses anticompetitive market-distorting behavior such as dumping and circumvention. While industrial policies such as IRA has the power to incentivize domestic investment and significantly growing this industry, the ability of those investments to endure is enabled by a corresponding trade policy. This level playing field ensures that domestic manufacturing investments incentivized by American taxpayer dollars are incubated as they scale. Take away any one of the legs and you render the whole apparatus unusable. Look no further than Europe as the one example of an unsustainable environment for clean energy manufacturing, not just in solar but wind as well, due to the lack of effective trade measures to support policies that seek to incentivize the growth of the domestic supply chain production base. There can be no doubt that trade policy is intrinsic to the efforts to build a resilient American solar value chain, and we believe this view has bipartisan support. This dynamic goes well beyond being just a risk to our company. It threatens the viability of all aspiring U.S.-based manufacturers who may never be able to finance the start-up of growth of their operations. Our support for the petition is founded on the thesis that we believe a level playing field, one that allows manufacturers to compete on the basis of their own merits, is essential for driving American innovation and competitiveness, promoting quality and enabling technology diversification that enhances developer choices. We also believe that everyone benefits from a thriving and resilient domestic manufacturing industry enabled by a level playing field and free of dependency on China. Apart from the positive impact on -- of domestic investment, job creation and economic value, which is reflected in the economic impact study commissioned by us and conducted by the University of Louisiana Lafayette that was released in February, domestic manufacturing also insulates developers and their pipelines against the risk of disruption resulting from global supply chain issues or potential geopolitical crisis. As validated by our customers and our order book, domestic manufacturing supply chain build resiliency into development pipelines, providing certainty of pricing and supply and ensuring continuity even in the face of widespread international supply chain disruption. Again, I want to be clear. We invite competition and free trade. All we seek is that the competition and trade is fair, enabled by a level playing field where all companies can compete on the basis of their own merits. This petition is about enforcing the rule of law and holding rule-breakers to account, enabling a level playing field for domestic manufacturing and supporting the efforts to scale American solar value chains. Importers of solar panels from manufacturers playing by the rules and operating in compliance with U.S. trade laws have little to fear from this petition and any potential investigation. Internationally, oversupply and dumping of modules at prices below cost also adversely impacts the Indian and European markets, both of which are seeking -- are seeing record levels of imports and low pricing. Referring to my earlier comments about thinking of policy as a 3-legged stool, the principle also applies to India, which offers supply-side drivers in the form of production-linked incentive programs, deployment targets that offer demand drivers and nontariff barriers such as the Approved List of Module and Manufacturers (sic) [ Approved List of Models and Manufacturers ] or ALMM. We are pleased that the government has decided to revive the mandate of its ALMM program, and First Solar was added to this list on April 29. We believe that enforcing this vital nontariff barrier will support the effort to level the playing field for domestic manufacturers, especially if combined with a similar program focused on cell manufacturers that could materialize as more domestic cell capacity comes online in the country. However, we remain concerned about the level of dumping in India and its potential to undermine the country's manufacturing ambitions. While ALMM applies to fully assembled modules, it does not safeguard the market against the dumping of solar cells or other upstream components, which undermine efforts to scale vertically integrated domestic manufacturing in the country. With this in mind, we are seeking an investigation into the dumping of solar cells in the India market. We believe that investigation is necessary to unfair market-distorting behavior that denies domestic manufacturers in India a level playing field on which to compete as the industry scales. Finally, moving to Europe, which lags the U.S. and India in its response to dumping and consequently continues to deepen its near total dependency on Chinese-made solar panels. While Europe currently appears to not have the political will to consider trade barriers that could address dumping, we are encouraged by decisions to the EU's foreign subsidies regulations to investigate potentially illegal subsidies to Chinese solar and wind manufacturers. We continue to monitor developments in Europe and engage with stakeholders there as we seek out opportunities to advocate for a level playing field in that market. To conclude, Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call on Slide 11. Alexander Bradley : Demand continues to be robust with 2.7 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date with an ASP of $0.313 per watt before adjusters, leading to a resilient contracted backlog of 78.3 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.6 gigawatts, and our Alabama and Louisiana factories and our R&D innovation center and perovskite development line remain on schedule. We continue to anticipate launching CuRe at our lead line factory in Ohio in Q4 of this year. In addition, we're increasing CapEx by $0.1 billion this year to accelerate CuRe conversion at our Vietnam facilities as well as at our third Perrysburg facility with a view to advancing global fleet replication by more than 1 year from our assumptions at our recent Analyst Day. Financially, we earned $2.20 per diluted share, and we earned -- ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $2 billion or $1.4 billion net of debt, maintaining our full year 2024 volumes sold and P&L guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per share -- per diluted share of $13 to $14. And with this, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Mark Strouse, JPMorgan. Mark W. Strouse: Appreciate all the color. Obviously, a lot going on right now. Mark, I wanted to start with your comments on India. So good to see you're added to the ALMM list. I know it's still somewhat early, but can you just talk about what you're seeing as far as pricing in that market since the ALMM went back into effect? And how are you weighing shipments to that market versus potentially shipping back to the U.S.? Mark Widmar : Yes. All right. Thanks, Mark. Look, since the ALMM has gone back into place, we are seeing pricing move up in the market. Again, ASPs, generally in India, are much lower than what we see here in the U.S. But they have moved up 5% or 10% from where we saw them before the ALMM, so moving in the right direction in that regard. I do think that with some of the other initiatives that we have in place and especially as we move forward, towards the latter half of this year, I think we could see even firm pricing as we exit this year going into next year, which is encouraging.  In the interim, we are shipping a lot of product into the U.S. So this year, we'll produce about 2.6 gigawatts of product in India. And we'll be shipping about 1 gigawatt, maybe slightly north of that, into the U.S. market. And really most of the first half shipments that we'll see, really into Q3 even, are going to be from India into the U.S. market at this point in time.  So that continues to be an option for us. It's also, like I said in our prepared remarks, as we scale up to 25, 26 gigawatts from a global fleet standpoint, all that product is really available to address and serve the needs of our U.S. customers. We'll continue to figure out what's the right optimal allocation in terms of how much stays to the Indian domestic market and what comes into the U.S. But I do see pricing dynamics improving in India since the ALMM has been put back in place. Operator : The next question is Andrew Percoco, Morgan Stanley. Andrew Percoco : So I guess, I mean, over the last few quarters, you guys have been highlighting that you expect bookings growth to slow. But I guess I'm just curious now that you've got some headlines around the potential removal of the bifacial exemption, the new AD/CVD petition and Yellen's commentary on China, I mean, shouldn't that be an accelerant for bookings? I get that you guys want to be selective because of your capacity position. But just curious on your updated thoughts on what you're seeing and expecting for bookings for the remainder of the year now that policy seems to be moving in your favor, and you've also got growing demand for clean energy in some of the AI data center markets that you guys had alluded to earlier in the call. Mark Widmar : Yes. So what I would say right now just in conversations with our commercial team and our Chief Commercial Officer, clearly, pricing in the market and -- has changed. As soon as there was an indication, really, it's starting to increase $0.03, $0.04 since the beginning of April. And then we continue to see a little bit more momentum now that the petition has been announced and some of the other statements that have been made by the current administration, which are all very, very supportive and constructive. So we are seeing more activity, more engagement. We're encouraged.  We have taken our assumption around bookings down a little bit. We did that largely with a lens of being conservative, of waiting to see exactly what we're starting to see, and the momentum is starting to pivot back in a more constructive way. And we'll see how that pans out. But a lot of engagement, a lot of customer meetings. I will be actually meeting with a number of customers next week as well with our commercial team, and we'll get a better pulse at that point in time. But I'd say that the sentiment clearly has changed over the last 3, 4 weeks. Operator : And up next is Philip Shen, ROTH MKM. Philip Shen : First one is related to the termination of convenience clause. Can you talk about how much of a buffer you guys might have to meet your guide, even if all the terminations -- termination for convenience clauses in '24 and '25 are exercised? And then secondarily, as it relates to pricing for future bookings, have you already started to see the benefits of the recently filed Southeast Asia AD/CVD petitions? My sense is pricing has already maybe started to move. Just curious if maybe you saw that in some of the bookings previously announced.  And then finally, as it relates to the technology, we recently wrote about a Japanese start-up that announced a record perovskite and CIGS lab efficiency of close to 27%. Can you give us an update on your tandem technology research? And specifically, when do you think you can make a definitive decision on the next-gen technology so that the commercialization path can be realized? Because our understanding is that it might take 3 full years. So you kind of need to maybe lock it in today in order to commercialize in the next 3 years. Alexander Bradley : Yes. So I'll take the termination for convenience and hand it over to Mark. So we haven't given a specific number related to this year. But if you note in the guide, we're maintaining our volumes sold guide at 15.6 to 16.3 gigawatts. So we're working under the assumption that if this volume were to be terminated, which has not happened yet, we've just been having discussions with a customer who's indicated that given the likely sale of their portfolio and the likely buyer being someone who already has volume from us and given the time frame of those deals pushing out a little bit that they are likely to -- if those all happen, then they would be likely to exercise that termination for convenience right.  But that's a customer that we have a larger order book with. They've already taken delivery of over 50% of the volume under that order. They will continue to take delivery of some of the remaining, a little bit under 50%. But they will likely, if those then transpire, terminate a portion of that backlog now. As I said, we will look to either reallocate to others or resell that volume. But it is one of the reasons you're seeing the cash guide come down a little bit, is that just given we're already into Q2, if we reallocate or resell now, it's quickly not going to be until late Q3, earlier Q4 at best before we move that volume to someone else.  So even though we're maintaining that guide, and we think we'll be able to do that this year, it might impact the timing of the cash. But in general, what we're seeing is, right now, the guide hasn't changed. What we're seeing this year, we think, is manageable with that range that we've given. Mark Widmar : Yes. And then on the pricing side, yes, so I somewhat made the statement on one of the earlier questions as well. We clearly are seeing the benefit as the market pricing has clearly firmed up and is moving up. If you look at just what we booked this last quarter before any of the adjusters, it's $0.30. If you look at the graph that's in the presentation slide, you can see that really none of that happened in April. So all that was really bookings that happened in the first quarter, which is really before any of the indications of this case started to get into the marketplace. So none of that really is reflected yet into -- so none of that impacted the Q1 bookings that we just reported.  But we are seeing movement into the market where pricing is firmed up, moving up and people obviously looking to move quicker than they would have otherwise because of the various uncertainties and trying to figure out the implications to the extent of further development pipeline and projects that they're looking to build out over the next several years and also knowing that the order book is already tight with First Solar and we're still supply-constrained in the grand scheme of things.  As it relates to the tandem technology, continue to move -- progress that from a couple of different paths. One is our thin-film CIGS tandem product. The other is continuing to work on a thin-film crystalline technology and then still advancing work on perovskite. And as kind of alluded to in our comments about next-generation innovative, disruptive technology and the advantages of our R&D innovation center, that is just -- we'll be starting up here by the end of this quarter, at the beginning of next quarter. And then our perovskite pilot line, between the 2 of them, it's almost $0.5 million investment that we made since we announced those decisions over a year ago.  What I'd like to do right now is -- I think those investments and getting those up and running are going to be clearly operational and informative of understanding of where we are with our technology as we produce full-size modules and then validate them in terms of their reliability. It's one thing to produce a record cell or even a module, but the other is how will it endure and stand up to the elements in terms of the conditions that we need to from a reliability standpoint. And no different in some of the reporting that's coming out, and we've been hearing about this over the last 6 months with TOPCon. TOPCon, when you look at some of the field performance and reliability that we're seeing right now, is significantly challenged and not hitting a performance level that would be anywhere close to acceptable to the market and nowhere close to its prior technology perk. So we've got to be very careful and mindful. It's not just working within the labs. It's also been producing it at scale and then getting it into the field and testing and getting comfortable with long-term reliability and viability. So I don't have a specific indication of time line. And what I would say, Phil, is we're making good progress. I think some of the R&D innovation center and the perovskite pipeline that we're working on right now, and that will be up and running. We'll have much better insights in terms of where we are in commercialization and time to market as we exit this year. Operator : The next question is Brian Lee, Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : I guess -- I know a lot of focus around the pricing commentary here, Mark. So I'm just going to ask another one around that, if I could. You said $0.03 to $0.04 roughly. You've been getting that sense or feedback since April, and then that doesn't even include the more up-to-date kind of AD/CVD feedback. So if we look at the bookings, $0.31 this quarter, not reflecting any of that, that's to suggest you're having discussions real time around kind of the mid-$0.30 per watt, maybe even going higher off of that. Is it fair assume that level is in play over the next couple of quarters as you think about booking future volume here, mid- to high 30s? And could we see it that quickly in the next couple of quarters? And then just secondly, Alex, you kind of quickly alluded to data center demand for electricity. That's obviously gaining a lot of attention. I mean if you look historically, I think you guys have had meaningful indirect exposure to selling to corporates, building some of that stuff out. Can you quantify or give us some sense of your best guesstimation of what percent of your demand in the U.S. is coming from those types of customers, data center-driven corporate, et cetera, and what you think that could become over time as you kind of look at that as being a new growth vector, if you will? Mark Widmar : On the pricing one, Brian, look, let's not get -- look, I'm happy with what we're seeing right now. I don't want to commit to an ASP in the mid-30s is what we'd expect to be able to realize at this point in time. What I'm trying to indicate is that we have seen a move in the market pricing. And there is a difference between -- just make sure we're clear, a difference between international versus domestic. There's an adder for the domestic product, as we've said before, $0.03, $0.04, $0.05 for that. So that volume will be priced at a higher ASP than not. So -- but what I would say is that we're encouraged, and our strategy for this year is to be patient and continue to move forward with bookings at attractive ASPs. And as we said before, this business model is still levered to growth and contribution margin. If we can get to a stable ASP environment as we look out over the next several years and grow the production capacity that we have in front of us, drive cost out as we continue to do, leverage our fixed cost across our overhead, there's pretty strong operating margin expansion that we can realize if we do that well. Alexander Bradley : Yes. So I don't know if I have a good number for you. I would say if you look at the companies that we talked about on the call, the ones that we're going to be adding to data center demand significantly, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, they value certainty even more than the utility. So if you think about utility, potentially contracting multiple projects, and they can deal with a level of failure or delay in a way that these guys can't if they have commitment to renewable targets at certain times. So they value certainty, and they certainly value the reliability of where the product is coming from and the concerns around slave labor.  So we tend to be the first port of call for many of these companies or the developers who are doing the work for them. And so in many cases, developers will come to us saying that they have had discussions with these people and that they have preference to buy or work with the solar products, especially for U.S.-based demand. So I don't think I have a percentage I can give you, but I would say that generally, we're going to be the favored supplier to the projects that are going to be supplying power to these data centers or these kind of asset owners. Operator : And Moses Sutton from BNP Paribas has the next question. Moses Sutton : What would be the biggest consideration in determining whether you add another factory? I know the pace of bookings, that they're naturally slow considering how far out you booked. But if the industry needs, let's say, 50 to 70 gigawatts per annum by late decade of ground mount in total and considering your market share position is further improving, could at least another factory would be viable in locking interconnection bottlenecks, the poly-based competition unknowns as they ramp up in the U.S. or just waiting on developer visibility to get more confidence here for these out-years? Mark Widmar : Look, I think the framework that we use is pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. One is whatever we do, we want it to be demand driven. And if we get confidence, especially as we progress now through the second half of this year, around a strong, enduring demand profile that we would need through the balance of this decade -- and one of the catalysts that we referenced already is what's going on with data centers, and there's a lot of activity going on there right now.  So first, I'll start with demand. The other one, just to make sure, is a stable policy environment. And so for what I am doing and what -- I think I said before in a couple of other calls that I've had is I've told my team is we need to be ready to go. We need to figure out our supply chain. So we need to have our glass strategy. We've got to think about tellurium, right? We got to think about site selection process and access to power and ready to go to -- as quickly as possible as we see those inflection points that we start to see strength in demand, and then we see through the other side of the November election that we believe we have a highly predictable and stable policy environment that we can then make informed decisions from. That starts to come into the mix. Then I think we're in a much more positive position to think about further capacity expansion. So that's what we're doing, and we're going to be as nimble as possible. And if all those -- we start filling out our scorecard a little bit there with the key dependencies that we need to further capacity expansion, we'll be ready to go as quickly as possible. And what we've proven is that once we make decisions, we get projects built, constructed, tools installed and up and running and ramped probably best than anyone else in this industry. And we want to continue to be able to do that.  I know there's been -- at times, I've heard someone was -- caught me by surprise that there was some concern about execution risk because we exited last year at 12 gigawatts, and we're going to 25, 26 gigawatts. That, in my mind, is the least of things that keep me up at night. We do this well, and we've demonstrated that. And like I said, our current activities that we currently have ongoing right now are progressing extremely well and on schedule. And we know if we need to continue to grow off the base we have right now, we have -- truly have the capability of doing that. And we just want to see the demand and the right policy environment to make that decision. Operator : Up next is Vikram Bagri, Citi. Vikram Bagri : I realized 5-in-1 question is the way to go, so I'm going to try that. Mark, you previously commented that excess panel inventory in the U.S. was nearly 30 to 40 gigawatts at year-end '23. A lot of debate about how that -- how much of that excess inventory is now. I was wondering if you can share some color on where you think that stands. And the reason for debate is the steep price increases as soon as the petition was filed indicates some level of concern that the excess inventory might not be that high.  And then, Alex, you had mentioned delays in -- delays and potential cancellation from hydrogen customer in the past. Is there any way you can take advantage of the spot pricing in the market? And then finally, a couple of press releases about bookings in the last 2 days. Were these contracts done in first quarter given the chart on Slide 5 shows no bookings since March? And if these contracts were entered into after 1st of May, can you share the price on those bookings as well? Mark Widmar : All right. Please come back with me on some of this because I want to make sure I got some of the questions. I'll start with the last one. The bookings that we reported really were all done from -- what was our -- was it in Feb 20? Feb 20, whatever. Our earnings call was at Feb 27 or 28, whatever the date was, and really through March 31. So that 854 megawatts, there's very little of that, that happened in the month of April. That's probably what I was trying to say before, is that the indication of a potential case for -- against Southeast Asia really wasn't into the market at the time that we were negotiating and closing on that booking volume. So all that booking volume, the 854 megawatts, which is incremental, was -- happened pretty much in the month of March. The quarter-to-date number is 2.7 gigawatts that we referenced as well. And again, all that happened before there was any real indication of some of the policy changes or even some of the statements that the administration has made here recently.  The inventory -- I think the other question that you asked was about the inventory levels and how much inventory may be in the U.S. And I know there's speculation and views of 30 gigawatts, maybe even more, that sits in the U.S. that's been brought in partly because of the moratorium that was provided on the circumvention. We've heard that type of number in the past. I have no real way to validate that. But I do believe that there has been, looking at the import records, an excessive amount of product that has been brought into the U.S. at a rate that's much higher than current demand, which all is going to have to be managed and worked through. And there's issues that are going to have to be dealt with how, once this moratorium is over, in theory, all that inventory has to be deployed and installed by the end of this year and to monitor and to ensure that truly is happening. Uncertain to me how that would happen, to be honest with you. So some of that inventory may be subject to tariffs, if that were not to happen. But to be seen on that regard. Then you asked me about -- the other, you can repeat. There was a question around hydrogen, and then I think there was a question around spot prices, unless Alex, you got either one of those. Alexander Bradley : I think just related to spot, I mean we talked before that there isn't a huge immediate spot market in the utility-scale solar in the same way that there is in resi. So when we talk spot, we're still talking for projects that are 2, 3 quarters ahead, maybe just not 8, 10, 12 quarters ahead. So when I think about the opportunity for us, as we have potential [ holdings ] come up in the year, if we have some short-term [ holes ] open up with things like termination of convenience, there's an opportunity, yes, for us to capture what I think you would call spot on a utility-scale basis, which is forward a few quarters. I don't think there's a lot of ability to sell meaningful volume on an immediate basis given the time lines for permitting and development of a utility-scale project. But certainly, if we have opportunities around any termination of convenience or if we have other customers that ask us to move product out, we'll certainly go out and see if there's an ability. If anyone else looks for products and wants to have product, we're willing to work with customers in that way. There could be some opportunity there. We also said we continue to be cumulatively oversold through 2026. So we continue to do an almost daily balancing of our supply-demand and work with our customers to see where things need to move both in and out. Mark Widmar : And then maybe if you could repeat your question on hydrogen or clarification on any of the things we responded to maybe that didn't hit the spot. Vikram Bagri : You already answered, Mark. I was asking if you have a hydrogen customer who might not take the delivery. If you could feed out those volumes in the spot market and benefit from higher prices. But Alex already answered. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Kashy Harrison, Piper Sandler. Kashy Harrison : So I'm going to follow Vikram and just ask a bunch at once as well. First one is on AD/CVD. Does your alliance expect to ask for critical circumstances if the Department of Commerce accepts your case? And then as we think about just critical equipment shortages in the market, I'm just curious if you know what proportion of your customers have secured all their critical equipment, hot transformers, high-capacity circuit breakers for their project development needs over the next several years just given how long those lead times are. And then just finally, I was just checking if the credits this quarter were $124 million as it's indicated in your Q. If so, it seems like your COGS per watt ex credit has come down quite a bit. And I was just wondering if you could talk to some of the drivers of the lower cost here. Alexander Bradley : Let me just take the credit one, and I'll pass it back to Mark. The credit was higher than that. So we had $194 million in the quarter. I think the guide was $190 million, so a little bit over. If you go back into the Q, there's a few moving pieces in the government grants receivables. So the number for Q1 was $194 million. Mark Widmar : In terms of the AD/CVD, which critical circumstances are effectively retroactivity of some of these tariffs, to me that's facts and circumstances that will evolve. It depends on what happens. It's extremely unfortunate, in my mind, that China has chosen to do what it's done so far, right? I think we -- this -- we were in a position, a balanced environment that we believe it was adequate for a domestic industry to grow and scale and create domestic capabilities. China, clearly, not only here in the U.S. but in India, is aggressively trying to prohibit that from happening and -- given the amount of overcapacity and pricing. And just to be clear, you guys are listening to all their comments and everything else. I think Daqo made a comment recently that 70%, 80% of the polysilicon guys are selling below cash cost, right? Jinko, but for a onetime item and including their subsidy income, their last quarter, they lost $3 a share. So everyone is -- it's a blood bath. And if China wants to continue to do that, let them do that on their own accord, right? We should not have to be exposing our domestic industry here in the U.S. and our domestic industry in India as an example to China's behaviors, right? We need to be able to find a way that allow companies to compete on their own merits and not be always threatened by China's oversupply and abusive, aggressive behaviors.  So if imports stay relatively stable as we go forward, if pricing on those imports stay relatively stable, then I think there's less of a likelihood that critical circumstances would be requested. But to be determined. And again, this is not just the First Solar. This is the coalition that has to make that call. But to me, it's around facts and circumstances that will determine that.  The other question around equipment and critical procurement and critical components and transformers and everything else, a number of our large customers are very sophisticated. And they have gotten ahead of this procurement and supply chain constraint as best they can. In some cases, people are ordering spares and other things that they can utilize across their development portfolio and trying to derisk as much as they can.  But look, there's no way you can insulate yourself 100% from that supply chain disruption and constraint. But we try to work as closely as possible. That's also why when we do our -- we're overallocated on an annual basis. When we then step back and assess the allocation against that, we do try to work as closely as we can with our customers to understand where they are in their development stage of their particular projects, and then things get moved out accordingly. But at any point in time, there's always subject to change. And what we continue to try to do is create some resiliency as best we can as we enter into a year and hopefully manage some of that during the year as best we can as projects move around. Operator : And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. It does also conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today. You may now disconnect.",

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard Romero from First Solar Investor Relations. Richard, you may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its second quarter 2024 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With me today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide business, strategy, technology and policy updates, Alex will discuss our bookings, pipeline, quarterly financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Reflecting on the first half of 2024, we are pleased with our ongoing efforts to strengthen the fundamentals of our business. With solid operating and financial performance, selective incremental bookings, robust pipeline of demand, including a near -- a recently signed 620-megawatt module supply agreement subject to the achievement of conditions precedent with a new U.S. customer that will be supplying power to a hyperscaler. And investment in technology, R&D infrastructure and manufacturing expansions, we continue to solidify our market position through strong execution. Our balanced approach to growth, profitability and liquidity, combined with multiple technological and business model points of differentiation enable us to deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights for the second quarter. From a commercial perspective, we continued our disciplined approach to bookings. Since our last earnings call, we have secured a net 0.9 gigawatts of bookings with an ASP of $0.316 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable or $0.334 per watt, assuming the realization of adjusters where applicable and in each case, excluding India domestic sales. This includes a 0.4 gigawatt debooking related to a termination for convenience exercised by one of our European power and utilities customers who is selling a portfolio of U.S. development assets as referenced on our last earnings call and who is obligated to pay the associated contract termination payment. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 3.6 gigawatts. Our total contracted backlog now stands at 75.9 gigawatts with orders stretching through 2030. From a technology perspective, since our Q1 earnings call, we have established a new world record CadTel research cell with a conversion efficiency of 23.1%, commissioned new critical R&D infrastructure in Ohio and remain on track to launch our CuRe program in Q4 of this year. Our CuRe program is expected to increase energy production in real world conditions through improved module temperature coefficient, bifaciality and degradation rate. Additionally, we have announced the ownership of certain issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of TOPCon crystalline silicon solar cells. And while Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of our second quarter 2024 results, I would like to highlight our ability to deliver financially with second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.25 and a quarter end net cash balance of $1.2 billion. Despite this strong execution and our success, delivering on the manufacturing technology, customer and financial commitments, we must acknowledge that our industry faces varying degrees of increasing external uncertainties, particularly related to policy, supply conditions and evaluations of strategic direction and capital allocation by certain large multinational companies. These will be discussed later during the call. Turning to Slide 4. Our growth plans remain on track. The expansion of our Ohio manufacturing footprint has been completed and commercial shipments began as scheduled at the end of the second quarter. The completion of this phase expands our manufacturing capacity into the state by almost 1 gigawatts to nearly 7 gigawatts. In Alabama, we expect to complete the installation of tools, complete plant certification and commence production this quarter with the first commercial shipments from the plan expected in Q4 of 2024. We are pleased with the speed at which we're able to construct, equip and commission the 2.4 million square foot facility, achieving this in approximately 24 months from the investment decision. Our new Louisiana facility is also on track with the start of commercial operations expected in the second half of 2025. Furthermore, we commissioned the Jim Nolan Center for Solar Innovation earlier this month. This new research and development innovation center in Ohio is the largest facility of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. The 1.3 million square foot facility includes a high-tech pilot manufacturing line which we expect will allow us to produce full-size prototypes of thin-film and tandem PV modules in a manufacturing sandbox, freeing up our commercial production lots. In addition, we are on track to commission our new perovskite development line at our Ohio campus in the second half of 2024. Combined, these new facilities represent an investment of nearly $0.5 billion in American R&D infrastructure. We believe that thin-film research is critical for commercializing multi-junction tandem devices which are anticipated to be the next disruptive innovation in the solar industry. While the U.S. leads the world in thin-film PV under First Solar's stewardship, China is racing to close the innovation gap and we expect that our strategic investment in R&D infrastructure will help us maintain our nation's strategic advantage in thin-film technology and position the next generation of disruptive, transformative solar technologies to be American-made. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to progress our technology roadmap and during the quarter, established a new world record CadTel research cell conversion efficiency of 23.1%. This achievement certified by the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory was accomplished at our California Technology Center. We remain on track to launch CuRe at our lead line in Ohio in Q4 of this year and following the pull-in of CapEx discussed at our previous earnings call, intend to accelerate replication across the fleet beginning in late 2025, with our Vietnam and third Ohio facility. Additionally, we announced the ownership of issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of TOPCon crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells earlier this month which we continue to leverage as we pursue multiple pathways towards our goal of developing the next transformative disruptive tandem solar technology. This portfolio which includes issued patents across various jurisdictions, including the U.S. and pending patents in the EU and Japan has validity extending to 2030. We are mindful that there have recently been a number of TOPCon patent ownerships announcements and several litigation claims related to particular aspects of TOPCon cell production. Based on thorough and ongoing analysis, including the engagement of third-party legal and technology experts, we firmly believe in the value and strength of our patents and are investigating several leading crystalline silicon cell manufacturers for potential infringement. If infringement is discovered, we intend to challenge the ability to manufacture, assemble and sell infringing TOPCon technologies by pursuing enforcement, licensing and other measures to safeguard our rights. I'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss our bookings pipeline and finances. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Moving on to Slide 6. As of December 31, 2023, our contracted backlog totaled 78.3 gigawatts, with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion. Through June 30, 2024, we contracted 2.7 gigawatts of incremental volume, reduced our bookings by 0.4 gigawatts due to the aforementioned contract termination by a European customer and recognized 6.1 gigawatts of volume sold. This brings our total backlog to 74.6 gigawatts at quarter end with an aggregate value of $22.3 billion implying an ASP of approximately $0.299 per watt, excluding adjusters where applicable. Since the end of the second quarter, we've entered into an additional 1.3 gigawatts of contracts, resulting in a total backlog of 75.9 gigawatts. Substantial portion of our backlog includes opportunities to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters if we realize achievements within our current technology road map as of the expected timing for delivery of the product. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 38.4 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters which if fully realized, could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, majority of which will be recognized between 2025 and 2028. This increase in adjusters relative to the prior quarter is a function of the opportunity discussed on our prior earnings call to accelerate the expected replication of CuRe across the fleet. This amount does not include potential adjustments which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog. Both the ultimate module being delivered to the customer which may adjust the ASP in the sales contract upwards or downwards and for increases in sales rate where applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. As reflected on Slide 7, our total pipeline of potential bookings remained strong, with bookings opportunities totaling 80.6 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 7.8 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid- to late-stage bookings opportunities decreased by approximately 0.8 gigawatts to 28.6 gigawatts, now includes 24.6 gigawatts in North America and 3.7 gigawatts in India. Within our mid- to late-stage pipeline, our 4.1 gigawatts of opportunities that are contracted subject to conditions precedent, including 1.2 gigawatts in India. And in the U.S., a 620-megawatt module supply agreement with a new customer who will be supplying power to our hyperscaler which Mark noted earlier. As a reminder, signed contracts in India will not be recognized as bookings until we've received full security against the offtake. Note that we anticipate reducing our opportunities on a contract subject to conditions precedent India by 0.4 gigawatts as a result of an expected termination of a defaulted module supply agreement with an Indian affiliate of a European oil major who is in the process of selling this business. As stated on previous earnings calls, given our diminished available supply through 2027, the long-dated time frame into which we are now selling and the need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security and other key contractual terms and given the uncertainty related to the policy environment due to the upcoming U.S. election, we will continue to leverage our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year. We intend to continue forward contracting with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value our points of differentiation. Slide 8 will cover our financial results for the second quarter. Net sales in the second quarter were $1 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion compared to the first quarter. Increase in net sales was driven by a 24% increase in the volume of megawatts sold and the aforementioned contract termination payment obligation of one of our European customers. Gross margin was 49% in the second quarter compared to 44% in the first quarter. This increase was primarily due to a higher mix of modules sold from our U.S. factories which led to $255 million in the Section 45X tax credits in the second quarter, the aforementioned contract termination payment obligation, reduction in warehousing and logistics costs and continued reductions in production costs. SG&A, R&D and production start-up expenses totaled $126 million in the second quarter, an increase of approximately $22 million compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher start-up expenses for our Alabama factory, higher R&D expenses associated with the development of next-generation solar technologies and higher professional fees. Our second quarter operating income was $373 million which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $97 million, ramp costs of $6 million, production start-up expense of $27 million and share-based compensation expense of $8 million. Second quarter other income was $5 million. Tax expense for the second quarter was $28 million compared to $19 million in the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher pre-tax income during the period and a change in our position related to reinvesting the accumulated earnings of a foreign subsidiary which allows us to repatriate certain offshore funds to support our strategic investments in the U.S. and show that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it's needed. The combination of the aforementioned items led to second quarter earnings per diluted share of $3.25. Next turn to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.8 billion compared to $2 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana, along with the repayment of working capital loans in India partially offset by operating cash flows from our modules business. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $559 million, a decrease of $61 million from the first quarter driven by the repayment of certain working capital loans in India which helped support the ramp of our new plant in the region. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.2 billion to $1.2 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows from operations were $193 million in the second quarter and capital expenditures were $365 million during the period. Continuing on Slide 10. Our full year 2024 guidance remains unchanged. Note following the aforementioned termination for convenience of 0.4 gigawatts in Q2, one of the limited number of contracts that have such a right, we expect volumes sold, revenue and net cash to be toward the bottom of our guidance range. From a second half earnings cadence perspective, we expect our net sales and cost of sales profile, excluding the benefit of Section 45X tax credits to be approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter. We forecast Section 45X tax credits of approximately $240 million in the third quarter and $335 million in the fourth quarter with an operating expense profile roughly evenly spread across the remainder of the year, this results in a forecasted earnings per diluted share profile of approximately 40% in the third quarter and 60% in the fourth quarter. Note, while it's a third quarter event, we, like many companies were impacted by the recent defective software update issued by CrowdStrike that resulted in IT outages around the world. First Solar's corporate and manufacturing operations were briefly impacted, including the temporary idling of our fleet which was gradually restored over a period of approximately 2 days. This incident did not impact our full year 2024 guidance. I'll now hand the call back to Mark to continue the business update. Mark Widmar : All right. Thank you, Alex. As reflected by remarks at the beginning of the call, we are pleased with our financial and operational execution for the second quarter. We have continued to deliver on our commitments and have largely advanced our planned initiatives throughout the year thus far, such as progressing our U.S. manufacturing capacity expansion on schedule, commissioning our research and development infrastructure build-out on plan and maintaining a disciplined approach to new bookings opportunities. That said, we are also mindful of several externalities which may impact the industry as a whole, including First Solar. Among these externalities we are most frequently encountering are the uncertainties related to politics and policies, irrational global supply conditions and the evaluation of strategic directions and capital allocation by certain large multinational companies. Firstly, with the November election fast approaching, the solar industry is again facing an uncertain policy environment. The impact of this uncertainty became more apparent as the second quarter progressed. We have observed increasing constraints on access to capital, both for early-stage solar technology companies seeking to finance the next stage of their growth as well as for the established companies looking to build domestic manufacturing capacity. Our financing parties wait to make investment decisions until they have a clear view of the policy picture. This uncertainty has also impacted developers evaluating risk and returns within project pro formas and which comes at a time when, as mentioned earlier, some oil and gas and power and utility developers are contemplating the pivot from renewables to prioritizing fossil projects. The potential for Republican control of the presidency in both Houses of Congress has given rise to concern over the prospect of a legislative reconciliation process or use of the Congressional Review Act adversely impacting the Inflation Reduction Act legislation or its related regulations. A change in the executive administration alone, regardless of the results of the Senate and House elections, has raised similar concerns of the potential use of executive orders to block or delay implementation of IRA-related guidance and the administration of both published and unfinalized regulations. While we cannot predict the outcome of the November election or what a Republican suite would mean for renewable energy industry and trade policies, we can help inform policymakers across the political spectrum of the significant economic and strategic benefits of promoting and securing a robust domestic solar energy manufacturing base and how policies, such as 45X of the IRA, significantly contribute to the economic life of our nation's communities, particularly those located in traditionally red states. According to an economic analysis commissioned by First Solar and conducted by the University of Louisiana, Lafayette, our investments are already delivering tangible value by creating jobs and raising wages for American workers. Our existing facilities, combined with our expansions in Ohio and new facilities in Alabama and Louisiana, are expected to see us support over 30,000 direct, indirect and induced American jobs by 2026 and $2.8 billion annually in labor income. Our growth trajectory and long-standing commitment to investing in local supply chains is estimated to support 7.3 jobs nationally for every First Solar job created and is expected to add over $10 billion annually to the country's economic output by 2026. We are demonstrating that investing in American solar manufacturing, innovation and supply chains delivers enduring job creation and economic value, solidifying solar manufacturers' role in Americas, all of the above approach to energy security. We believe our model of high-value domestic manufacturing is the towering example of what are the art of the possible is when the nation follows through on bipartisan goals of countering China's ambition to dominate critical supply chains. Our manufacturing and domestic sourcing is also an example of capturing and retaining maximum value in the U.S., leveraging it to spur cycles of innovation to advance American technological leadership and attract and retain an enduring workforce. This is, however, a relatively unique example. While intended to enable the growth of domestic renewable manufacturer and value chains, we believe Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 can and must be strengthened by establishing guardrails and prevent companies controlled by, owned or subject to the jurisdiction of adversarial governments such as China from receiving U.S. taxpayer dollars. We believe that any legislation that establishes these guardrails will help reinforce the IRA's intent of encouraging true value in job creation and retention across the solar value chain. A message we believe resonates with policymakers across the political spectrum. Despite the political uncertainties ahead, a look back on the quarter reflects several positive developments in the trade environment. Over the past quarter, we have seen the United States government continue to address systemic overcapacity in China by leveraging the tools and the trade policy toolbox. Recently, the Biden-Harris administration acted to close a loophole in trade law by removing the Section 201 bifacial module exemption which the Trump administration had also attempted to remove and announced plans to double the Section 301 tariffs on solar cells and modules imported from China, another trade measure initiated by the Trump administration. In addition, the 2-year anti-circumvention solar bridge moratorium expired in the second quarter and the administration pledged to crack down on stockpiling through \"vigorous enforcement\" announcing that importers which brought product and tariff free during the moratorium will be required to certify as to module installation by the December 2024 deadline with detailed information about the imported modules being deployed or pay the required tariff. In June, the U.S. International Trade Commission by unanimous and notably bipartisan decision, issued a preliminary determination finding a reasonable indication of material injury caused by the dumping of solar cells and modules by Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Material injury caused by subsidies by Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam and a threat finding caused by subsidies in Cambodia. The unanimous bipartisan vote supports the petition of the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee which First Solar is a member and underscores the harm caused by the unfair trade practices of China solar companies and their affiliates in Southeast Asia. The alliance is currently evaluating filing critical circumstances petitions in response to the surge of injurious solar imports from the subject countries in the wake of the Department of Commerce's initiation of the trade investigation. For example, recent data suggests import increases of more than 60% from Malaysia and Vietnam and approximately 19% from Thailand. Such petitions are filed with the United States Department of Commerce determines that critical circumstances exist, cash deposit requirements can be imposed retroactively on solar cells and panels entering the country up to 90 days prior to the date of the Commerce's preliminary determinations. Critical circumstances can be alleged at any point until just before Commerce's final determination. Based on the Republican campaign platform which has expressively contemplated employing tariffs to increase trade imbalances, we believe it is reasonably foreseeable that if administration were to change could result in incremental tariffs on the Chinese crystalline silicon supply chain operating from Mainland and through its Southeast Asia and other satellite countries. While broadly beneficial to us given our significant and expanding U.S. manufacturing base, any new universal tariffs on imports could adversely impact the gross margin related to our Malaysia, Vietnam and India production sold into United States. Finally, it is also important to note that regardless of the outcome of the November election, utility scale demand for renewables is expected to continue to grow. The sources of this projected substantial demand are varied, including from data center, the reshoring of manufacturing, cryptocurrency mining, the heating and cooling, to name a few. Critically, such demand is generally not dependent on policy-enabled drivers. Solar continues to demonstrate that in many U.S. locations, it is the lowest cost source of energy and there are a few other generation sources that can be expanded at scale or notably deployed as quickly as solar, a critical attribute for end users who place a priority on time to power. In addition, given the presence of long-term fixed price PPAs, relatively predictable degradation, few moving parts and an unlimited free fuel source in the form of sunlight, solar is by nature, is deflationary energy generation asset, further contributing to the nation's economic growth. Moving on from political consideration. The second externality, a long common theme in the solar industry is irrational oversupply, driven almost exclusively by China's well-documented ambitions to dominate solar supply chains. The unsustainable market conditions resulting from this behavior continue to be an adverse macro condition confronting module manufacturers like First Solar that are committed to competing on a level playing field and on the basis of their merits and undertaking growth that is underpinned by demand. These market-distorting practices have resulted in a 2024 year-end projected U.S. oversupply position of approximately 40 gigawatts. Oversupply conditions in the EU continued unabated as policymakers struggled to provide a coherent policy response to ensure sustainable manufacturing conditions with the -- in the European block. In India, a challenged ASP environment is a large part a consequence of Chinese cell dumping, that is artificially lower pricing and challenges the country's aspiration to end its reliance on an adversarial by developing a domestic manufacturing base that serves a domestic market. Despite several of our crystalline silicon competitors publicly reporting significant financial losses for the first half of the year as they work to shed excess inventory and rationalize capacity, the Chinese solar industry continues its race to the bottom through overbuilding capacity. Ignoring clear indications that the market cannot sustain such levels of production, this results in continued dumping of products into key markets at depressed prices. Despite the recently published proposal by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology seeking to raise the minimum capital ratio for new PV capacity and impose intellectual property ownership criteria related to capacity expansion, there is skepticism that such measures will be effective in curtailing production expansions and reshoring supply and demand balance. Particularly as a consequence, we see China capacity expansions -- excuse me, particularly as we see -- continuously see China capacity expansion plans announced. In a market challenged by irrational oversupply and in sharp contrast, the results recently announced by some of our Chinese competitors, we have continued to deliver strong performance as reflected by our year-to-date earnings, recent bookings and total backlog. And while the crystalline silicon industry faces potential obstacles to innovation due to weakening fundamentals and pending legal challenges to its freedom to operate, including as it relates to First Solar's recently announced TOPCon technology patents. During the quarter, we established a new record CadTel research cell, remain on track related to our CuRe launch and fleet replication schedule and commissioned our new R&D facility. The third externality we have observed relates to certain multinational companies' strategic direction and capital allocation. As referenced on our prior earnings call and during this call, we're observing some multinational oil and gas and power and utility companies, particularly those based in Europe, considering pivots from renewable project development back to fossil projects in an effort to increase returns. For example, we've been made aware that a U.S. affiliate of a European-based multinational oil and gas customer is evaluating their strategic direction with regards to renewable project development. Notwithstanding, we believe the underlying fundamentals of solar remain robust. As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are seeing the potential for a significant increase in demand as the decade advances, driven in part by data center load growth. Ten of our largest customers have ongoing and future projects that are serving the nation's largest hyperscalers, deploying our technology for the balance of the decade. According to an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group, data center-driven energy demand is expected to increase by 15% to 20% annually through 2030. Total U.S. power consumption is expected to increase by 3% per year through the end of this decade, with data centers alone expected to contribute more than 60% of the total growth. We believe that this potential hyperscale related demand, coupled with their publicly stated commitments to address their energy needs through clean generation, along with our strong track record of partnering with developers to provide solutions for these off-takers, places First Solar in a strong position to have an important role in powering the industry of the future. As demonstrated by our recently signed, 620-megawatt module supply agreement subject to additional conditions precedent with a new U.S. customer that will be supplying power to a hyperscaler. Underlying fundamentals related to fossil fuel retirements, the movement towards electrification, utility and corporate demand for clean energy, scrutiny of environmental impact and social consciousness of supply chain providers and load growth, especially related to AI-driven data center demand, aligned with First Solar's position as a leading provider of eco-efficient modules and its approach to responsible solar. We're also seeing increased demand driven by the modified domestic content bonus Safe Harbor guidance issued by the Department of Treasury and IRS in May of 2024. The updated guidance sets out a more practical points-based calculation rather than a cost-based calculation for a renewable energy project to qualify for the bonus, placing a high value on vertically integrated manufacturing that utilizes domestic procured components, a profile exemplified by First Solar's growing domestic manufacturing operations. Given the high domestic content embedded in our U.S. produced Series 6 and Series 7 modules which critically feature a domestically manufactured cell and incorporate domestic components for either all or almost all of the points eligible components specified in the elective Safe Harbor in the May 2024 updated guidance, our customers' projects can satisfy key aspects of the domestic content bonus criteria just by procuring First Solar modules. On the new elective Safe Harbor, there are opportunities for First Solar to blend its deliveries to customers with modules produced across its global fleet, potentially increasing the optimization of all of our factories while enabling our customers to qualify more projects for the domestic content bonus. In summary, while external factors such as the outcome and impact of the forthcoming election and the continued impact of the global Chinese-driven overcapacity on supply present challenges, First Solar continues to focus and deliver on our planned initiatives. Through continued execution, active policy engagement, utilizing our balanced approach to growth, profitability and liquidity and leveraging our points of differentiation, we believe we remain well-positioned to navigate these challenges. To conclude, Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call on Slide 11. Alex Bradley : Demand continues to be robust, 3.6 gigawatts of net bookings year-to-date, including 0.9 gigawatts of net bookings since our last earnings call, leading to a resilient contracted backlog of 75.9 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.7 gigawatts. Alabama and Louisiana factory expansions remain on schedule. The expansion of our Ohio manufacturing footprint has been completed and commercial shipments began as scheduled at the end of the second quarter. From a technology perspective, we've established a new world record CadTel research sale, commissioned our new R&D facility in Ohio. We expect our CuRe line launch in Q4 of this year, announced the ownership of certain issued and pending patents related to the manufacturing of TOPCon crystalline silicon cells. Financially, we earned $3.25 a diluted share and we ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $1.8 billion or $1.2 billion net of debt. We're maintaining our full year 2024 guidance, including forecasted full year earnings per diluted share of $13 to $14. And with that, we conclude our prepared remarks and open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : And your first question comes from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : The slides say you guys booked 1.3 gigs in July. And then the press release says 900 megawatts were booked since the last call. The $0.316 per watt disclosed was on the 900 megawatts but that seems to include the cancellation of the EU customer. What was the ASP on the full 1.3 gigs or gigawatts gross bookings in July, assuming that's the correct number. So that's the first question. Second question is around the bookings outlook ahead. Can you provide some additional detail on that 4.1 gigawatts of opportunities confirmed but not yet booked on Slide 7. When could these translate to bookings? We're in this policy environment that's uncertain, when do you think bookings accelerate and reflect -- start to reflect this kind of higher tariff, higher price environment? Mark Widmar : Phil, on the ASPs, yes, so we did have a cancellation during the quarter which we referenced which is the 0.4, so that is the delta. The ASPs that we reported net of the cancellation is in line with where the gross ASPs would be as well. The actual cancellation was slightly lower but don't take it as a material delta. The numbers are in line with the net numbers that have been reported from that standpoint. Bookings from a standpoint of momentum, look, there's -- what we've -- our strategy has been, let's be patient and let's make sure the market has an opportunity to continue to digest all the information that's coming about, right? And we believe there's still even more to come and we kind of alluded to a few. One is the potential announcement of critical circumstances. We think that there is a momentum potentially for addressing the foreign entity of concern and the potential use of taxpayer dollars to go to adversarial countries. We think there are other initiatives that could be focused on examining the India imports coming into the U.S. and the potential use of Chinese cells in the manufacture of those products and brought into the U.S. market. And we also believe that there's still, as previously indicated in the domestic content guidance that was communicated in May that the current administration is evaluating the potential use of integration, I should say, of a wafer to qualify for domestic content. So we're just going to try to be as patient as possible, when you throw in the mix of recently announced TOPCon IP. We're going to be patient as possible to let all that information to be digested with the market to the extent we can see ASPs that are attractive to us in the windows that we're trying to book out into and I still want to continue to remind people that these are windows, their bookings are going out into '27 and '28. When we look at the bookings last quarter and you include the tech adders which push us north of $0.33, I think we're moving in the right direction and where we feel comfortable where pricing will be. So I think there's momentum there. I think I want the market still to digest all of the uncertainty. And once that gets better understood into the marketplace, I think you'll see more momentum in our bookings as we close out the year. Having said that, there's still an election in front of us but I still think a lot of people are going to be very -- reluctant potentially is a good use to word -- a good word to use for booking into '27 and '28 with less certainty on policy environment. So that momentum may impact us as well. But I do think there's an opportunity here to see a little bit more momentum as a lot of this information is digested and we'll see how we progress through the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jon Windham with UBS. Jon Windham : I guess as you've moved forward on Alabama, the focus will turn to Louisiana. And just, I guess, a couple of questions on the same topic. Any key milestones that you would point us to over the next 6 to 9 months to keep track of that project? And then at what point do you think we'll get a little bit more specific visibility on when that ramps beyond just saying the second half of 2025. Thanks again and a great result. Mark Widmar : Yes. So look, I think the first milestone which you expect to start seeing as we exit this year into next year, it would just be a completion of the construction of the building. And you can see that a lot of the exterior construction for the building has been completed but there's still quite a bit of work that needs to be done on the interior and then it will be tool move in. So our current plan will be Q1, beginning of Q2 will be the tool move in for Louisiana for that factory. Then there's the energization process. And then [indiscernible] is going to line up to an integrated run very similar to -- we just started our integrated run this year for Alabama, you roll the plot forward to July of next year, we should be looking towards an integrated run at that point in time, it would be early Q3. So we're making real good progress, happy with what we're seeing right now. Look, hopefully, we have confidence in what we've been able to do. This is our last factory and a journey to get over north of 25 gigawatts of capacity. We started with -- not too long ago with 6 gigawatts. And so we've been able to, in a relatively short period of time to meaningfully increase our manufacturing capacity and the team has done an excellent job in delivering. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Andrew Percoco : I do just want to kind of come back to the election point that you made earlier, Mark. I'm just trying to clarify, do you think this is going to slow momentum because developers are on pause? Or do you think this could actually accelerate momentum just given your domestic footprint just on the view that a potential Republican President would likely have a much more protectionist policy view. I'm just trying to get a better sense of whether this is a pre- or post-election bookings and pricing acceleration? Mark Widmar : Yes. Look, I think it's -- the answer is both unfortunately. I think initially there will be -- there'll be some pause with trying to understand exactly the policy environment and what potential implications there will be if there is a new administration and Republican control. But I think as you see through that dust, it's going to be very clear that in my discussions in D.C., clearly, geopolitical tensions with China aren't getting any easier when you go to the Republican side of the conversation. There are going to be tariffs that are going to be imposed which are going to a better advantage First Solar and our domestic footprint for sure. And there's a real reluctancy of using U.S. taxpayer dollars to advantage Chinese owned and controlled company. So all that, I think, plays to our strength. But at the same time, I think everyone's going to want to understand kind of the environment, so there could be an initial pause. And then I think once that happens, you could see further acceleration. And in some cases, you may even see a pull forward of projects from '26 into '25 if there's a view that there's a legislative process potentially that could change certain provisions within the IRA, there may be an acceleration of everybody trying to monetize as much as they can in '25 before budget reconciliation process could potentially impact the legislation and call that maybe late Q3 of '25 kind of view of the world. So I think we're going to see a little bit of both, maybe some pause just to assess. But then I think what likely plays out with the Republican controlled D.C. would be a very favorable outcome for First Solar's domestic manufacturing. Alex Bradley : Andrew, Mark is talking about it from a customer perspective. The same is also true from us. We talked before about how there's potentially some customer timing question around when they would want to make bookings. The same is true for us as to when we want to take a booking and you see that in the very judicious approach we've been taking and what looks historically like relatively low bookings in this quarter, that's a deliberate outcome for us. And so as we think through the risk profile of taking bookings today, the risk profile around the election, most scenarios would tell us that it makes sense for us to wait, especially given that one of the things that First Solar prizes itself on is we honor our contracts. And so if we set a price today and things change around the election that could otherwise lead to different outcome, we will honor the contract that we signed in the same way we expect our customers to honor the contracts they have signed. So there's a lot of things here that will lead us to wait as well as the customer. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Mark Strouse : I wanted to follow up on Phil's question earlier. Just comparing and contrasting the ASPs of the bookings in July versus what you put up on the last earnings call, up a bit kind of despite all of the news that's come out intra quarter. You mentioned kind of customers are kind of digesting all of the news flow. Is there any other color to that you would call out as far as timing of those deliveries, 2027 versus 2030 that also might be a factor in that? And then just a quick follow-up. Do you have a customer in mind to backfill for the 400-megawatt cancellation? Should we just simply add that to our 2025 numbers? Is there any chance that that could potentially come back into 2024? Mark Widmar : Yes. Look, on the last question, I guess, first, I'll hit on that is, look, there is a chance. We're actively engaged right now with negotiations on a portion of that volume. But at the same time, we're just trying to be balanced in our views. We only have 5 months left in the year. The timing of the requirement for those modules and what project, it has to be something that is not too far long in the design phase because if it's already been designed to a different product and then to switch the engineering drawings and everything else and potentially even the supply chain balance the system that they would -- they are currently procuring could have to be modified as well. So I think it's best just to assume that it does not happen this year. But clearly, we're going to want to sell through that volume as quickly as we can. As it relates to the bookings, yes, there is -- to me, there's really 4 large bookings. There was -- in the current quarter, forget about the debooking. In the current quarter, there was 4 large ones. And I'm also including the one booking that subject to CP -- contracts subject to CP, right which is a 600-megawatt project. So you include that in there. That deal is completely -- is finalized all terms and conditions and ASPs and all that stuff is finalized. And it's subject to a developer getting actual finalizing control of a site on their end. And we hopefully will see that close out this upcoming quarter. So I look at it, there's 4 large bookings for the quarter or 3 bookings plus a contract which aggregates up to about 1.8 gigawatts when you look at it from that perspective. And most of that volume is kind of '26, '27 and '28. So it is out into a longer-dated window and is still maintaining good ASPs. And while we always want to make sure that we're highlighting the impact of those adders as we indicated, we're starting our CuRe lead line this quarter and we'll be replicating across the fleet. So by the time we actually deliver against for those projects, we'll be able to monetize the full value of those adders. So I look at the kind of the ASP numbers that we should be most reflected upon is the ASP with the adder. And so good projects, a good window which we need to book with, good counterparties, happy to continue to see more and more First Solar modules being associated with data center and expansion of data centers. So overall, we're pretty pleased with that. And we'll continue to see customers and willingness to move forward and engage. I do think given the winners that we're booking out into, there will be some that are going to continue to sort of maybe evaluate and assess until there's better clarity exactly what where the policy environment will land in D.C. and no different than what we want to do the same thing as Alex indicated. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Sorry to beat a dead horse but on the bookings front, just had a pricing question, were all the bookings from U.S. fabs in the quarter? Or was there some from Asia in there as well? I'm just trying to, I guess, get a sense of like-for-like pricing given your comments from the last call that U.S. pricing had moved maybe $0.03 to $0.04 per watt higher in recent times owing to tariff uncertainty. Is that kind of still what you're seeing mid-30s level in the U.S. specifically? And then second question I had was just big picture thoughts on new CapEx and timing of any kind of next manufacturing capacity expansion, whether new technology tandem or Series 7, what are kind of major bottlenecks decision criteria you're thinking about to potentially move forward on a decision there? Mark Widmar : Yes. So the bookings, there was some India domestic volume that was booked within the quarter and we highlighted that and called that out of the average ASP. It wasn't a significant portion of the total volume but it was a piece of it. But there are shipments from India, in particular, that are being sold into the U.S. market that are included in that average ASP. I wouldn't say all that dissimilar from our normal mix of domestic versus international but there is some in India volume that will be sold into the U.S. market that's captured in the bookings for the quarter. The -- one thing I want to make sure is that when we go back and talk about pricing environment, what I would say is what we saw going into last earnings call, we had an earnings call in Feb, pricing got really soft in the month of March, then we rolled through beginning of April and there was -- at that time, it was an indication of the AD and CVD action against Southeast Asia, the new trade initiative that happened in early April. And then we started to see prices firm up. And then we ended up closing out on a reasonable amount of volume in that earnings call that we announced in May. But my comment that I even said last time was that some of that -- my point was the $0.03 to $0.04 was from also the weakness that we saw initially within the quarter that then firmed up. So I want to be clear, with adjusters we're at $0.33, $0.33 and change. I don't think we should be looking at that, that number is going to go up into above the mid-30s kind of range, right? So even -- to me, it's mid-30 as a cap and south of mid-30 in kind of where we ended up with the $0.336. I think that's kind of where we ought to be thinking about it. And it's going to ebb and flow any particular quarter, depending on what our mix is and what we're selling from domestic and international because domestic prices are higher than international. But I also want to make sure that we should not be thinking that we're going to at least in our mind, if we can sell through in a horizon that's that far out, under the current policy construct at those types of ASPs, we still find that to be extremely attractive. Now in a higher tariff environment which is why we're trying to be patient on our domestic product and what we're selling through at, then I think there's an increased opportunity for higher ASPs domestically. But that is all triggered by a potential change in administration and overall change to strategy around policy environment. So -- but anyway, that's how we should think about ASP. Around new CapEx, to me, it's all tethered back to the same policy conversation. Once we have a view and understanding what that policy environment is going to be like, then we can make a decision on how we want to proceed in that regard. And as I've indicated on prior calls, we're going to continue to do all the work we need to, to be ready. And once we're -- the understanding of the policy environment, we'll know which scenario we should go down. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri with Citi. Vikram Bagri : I apologize if I missed this. Mark, I wanted to understand your exposure to the uncertainties you highlighted, the capital allocation, maybe political and so forth and regulatory. Are you sort of like trying to indicate that the backlog is completely secure and these uncertainties only impact the forward-looking outlook? Or there is -- you're having discussions where there might be more calculations due to convenience. And then staying on that same topic, Mark, the Chevron Doctrine ruling has very widespread applications and a lot of the IRAs interpretation by government agencies, do you see any risks from challenges to those interpretations directly or indirectly to First Solar? Mark Widmar : Yes. Look, I think what we tried to highlight in the call is that there is externalities right now that create some amount of uncertainty. And one is, obviously, the political environment, we spend a lot of time around that. The other is clearly the significant overcapacity that we continue to see unabated from China and we're just trying to continue to highlight that and also emphasize why there's -- it's so important for us to be very aggressive on a trade policy standpoint, whether here in the U.S. or in India or even actions and initiatives we're trying to do in the EU, right? So we think those are all important things that everyone needs to be mindful of. The one -- as it relates to whether this calls into question our backlog, those 2 are not calling into question the risk of our backlog from a contractual standpoint, right? Now if for some reason, there's a new policy environment, the Republicans were to getting into control and they eliminated the tech-neutral ITC or minimized it, reduced it, that could have an impact on our viability of our customers' projects and their associated returns. I mean, clearly, that's going to have a ramification to First Solar because now project fundamentals have modified. There's no view of that per se happening but it's an indication of when we go through the political uncertainty or the election process that we're going to be going through and if there's a Republican control, there's a number of things that could be addressed as part of the IRA that may or may not have any potential implications on us. We're just trying to highlight that as such. So no impact on the backlog from that standpoint but for some dramatic pivot or change into the market. The one we are trying to highlight is that we had -- look, this is not news. You can go and look at a lot of oil and gas majors, large oil and gas majors. And they are assessing viability of project returns in solar and deployment of capital and allocation of capital. We had a European power utility company that was on our books for over 1 gigawatt of volume. They end up taking 600 megawatts or so of that volume and then terminating about 400 megawatts of that volume because they have made a decision to exit the U.S. market. That happens. But as we said in the last call, the good thing about that is on the side of that equation is somebody acquiring their development portfolio happens to be a long-term First Solar customer who is 100% sole source to our technology. So it's a good thing long term. It creates near-term disruption. This customer already had the framework agreement with us. So near term, they don't need incremental modules to build out that development pipeline which they're acquiring. But longer term, that just further establishes us with a higher penetration of market share. The -- we also highlighted in India, there was a large oil and gas major who, while it was not a booking, it was a contract that we have that they're now selling the business. And as a result of that, there's a termination associated with it. They've got a 30-day period in which to cure it. If they don't, then they're going to pay us a termination payment. So there's things that are happening that are around us that we're just trying to make sure people understand that as these large multinational companies either invest or further accelerate their investments or decide to decelerate, it could have an impact on us. In the backdrop to all this other stuff happening, we have others like the Brookfields of the world who are acquiring developers. So they're on the other side of the equation. They're making acquisitions here in the U.S., they're making acquisitions in India and so on and even in Europe and we have relationship with them as well. So there's just this intermix of the stuff happening right now we thought it was important that people understood. It shouldn't be a surprise, especially as large oil and gas majors they've been highlighting this CEO changes, other things that have happened and the assessment of ultimate deployment of capital and where solar fits in that strategy. So Chevron, the last one you highlighted. Look, I don't think -- at least the interpretation that I continue to get from my team is probably very little impact. A lot of the IRA and some of the guidance associated with the IRA where tax regs and tax rules generally not really in kind of the bull's eye of where you would focus on from the Chevron deference. And so I don't think there's any significant exposure. We know there are some concerns maybe around hydrogen and some of the other interpretations that were provided. But at least as it relates to domestic content or the manufacturing tax credit and those types of things, we don't see Chevron impacting that at this point in time. Alex Bradley : Vikram, just on the backlog. So we've said before, we have fixed price agreements. And what we're saying here is those still stand. In the event of a systemic shock to the system, I think some of the risk ultimately could fall on us if there's significant defaults and customers are in trouble. But generally, I would say we look to the strength of the contracts in the event that there's a determination of the convenience option, customers choose to utilize that. And we've said before, that's on a very small part of our backlog, then we would collect the termination payment. In the event that customers default, we've shown and I think it's fair to say that we believe our contracts are 2-way agreements, customers have obligations as well with us and we will go after termination payments that are owed to us.

This call is being webcast live on the Investors section of First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to First Solar, Investor Relations. You may begin. Richard Romero : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, the company issued a press release announcing its third quarter 2024 financial results. A copy of the press release and associated presentation are available on First Solar's website at investor.firstsolar.com. With us today are Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer; and Alex Bradley, Chief Financial Officer. Mark will provide business and updates, Alex will discuss our bookings pipeline, quarterly financial results and provide updated guidance. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions. Please note, this call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in today's press release and presentation for a more complete description. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mark Widmar, Chief Executive Officer. Mark Widmar : Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today. As we approach the end of 2024. We remain pleased with the progress made across our business navigating against the backdrop of industry volatility and political uncertainty with a continuous focus on balancing growth, profitability, and liquidity. As noted at our Analyst Day in late 2023 and our previous earnings call, our story is about the value of long-term strategic decision-making. Underpinned by differentiated technology and business model, which endeavors to drive value creation for our shareholders and partners. We expect that this discipline long-term approach will allow us to work through the outcomes of the upcoming U.S. elections as well as continued volatility across the solar manufacturing industry. Beginning on Slide 3, I will share some key highlights from the third quarter. From a commercial perspective, we continued our highly selected approach to contracting with a net 0.4 gigawatts of new bookings since our last earnings call. This brings our year-to-date net bookings to 4 gigawatts and our total contracted backlog to 73.3 gigawatts with order stretching through 2030. From a manufacturing perspective, while we're pleased with record production of 3.8 gigawatts in the quarter, our financial results were impacted by product warranty charge of $50 million due to manufacturing issues, which we have identified and taken actions to address related to the initial production of our Series 6 -- Series 7, excuse me, product. Primarily attributed to variability in the effectiveness of the glass cleaning process at the beginning of our production line and an error in our process of predicting the engineering performance margin. We inaugurated our new $1.1 billion Alabama facility, which when fully scaled, adds 3.5 gigawatts of vertically integrated nameplate solar manufacturing capacity. The start of commercial operation at the Alabama facility along with our under-construction Louisiana facility, which remains on track to begin operations in the second half of 2025 keeps us on course to achieve our projection of over 14 gigawatts of annual U.S. nameplate capacity and over 25 gigawatts of global nameplate capacity by 2026. This growth is expected to support an estimated 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in the U.S. alone. Representing $2.8 billion in annual labor income, demonstrating the significant contribution to our nation's economic growth that high value solar manufacturing can provide. Turning to technology. As planned, we are launching CuRe production at our lead line in Ohio in Q4 of this year. We intend to launch this production in a phased approach, initially producing and selling approximately 0.4 gigawatts of CuRe product through Q1 of 2025. Upon successful field performance validation following the deployment of this volume of sold CuRe product, we intend to permanently convert the Ohio lead line to CuRe in Q4 2025 as well as replicate CuRe across the fleet, beginning as scheduled with our Vietnam, and third Ohio facilities and time to start capturing upside from our contractual revenue adjusters. In addition, at our new perovskite development line in Perrysburg, this quarter will be the first time we'll be able to run technology samples through an automated process that simulates in-line manufacturing conditions as we accelerate our efforts to develop the next breakthrough in thin film photovoltaic technology. With regard to intellectual property, we have recently sent notification letters to Tier 1 solar manufacturers that we believe are infringing on First Solar's TOPCon patent portfolio, which I'll discuss in more detail later in the call. While Alex will provide a comprehensive overview of the third quarter 2024 financial results, I would like to highlight our third quarter earnings per share of $2.91 which includes the $50 million product warranty charge referenced earlier. Finally, our leadership in thin film technology and track record of investing in innovation led to First Solar being recognized by MIT Technology Review's annual list of climate tech companies to watch, the only solar technology and manufacturing company to be included in this year's list. Furthermore, we were also proud to make our debut as TIME\u2019s magazine's World's Best Companies in 2024 list. Moving to Slide 4, we recently published our annual sustainability report and would like to take this opportunity to share a few highlights. In our 25th year, we are doubling down on our commitment to the principles of responsible solar, which drives our company's environmental, social, and governance strategy, leadership, and differentiation. From the health and environmental benefits of achieving greater avoidant emissions through our ultra-low carbon solar technology to our longstanding leadership in PV recycling and commitment to human rights, transparency, and credible third-party validation. We continue to establish new standards while challenging industry as a whole to do better. Over the past year, we continue to drive environmental, social, and governance progress. As part of our culture of continuous improvement, we successfully reduced our water and waste intensity per watt produced and increased the percentage of women in our workforce in 2023 relative to the preceding year. We continue to build on our longstanding leadership position in PV recycling in 2023, achieving a global average material recovery rate of 95% across our recycled facilities. Today, we operate high value recycling facilities in the U.S., Germany, Malaysia, Vietnam, and India. A shift to producing a verifiable ultra-low carbon solar is needed to ensure that the global PV manufacturing industry does not undermine its role in its fight against climate change. Although, the industry currently accounts for a small portion of global emissions today that's changing. A report by Clean Energy Buyers Institute warns that a business as usual approach dominated by energy intensive, crisp and silicon would lead PV manufacturing to exceed aluminum manufacturing. Currently the fourth most emission intensive industrial commodity by 2024 -- 2040. We are proud to be leading the charge by having the world's first solar modules to achieve EP Climate plus designation and meet the industry's first ultra-low carbon solar thresholds for global use. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to address the numerous intellectual property challenges concerning crystalline silicon cell technology that are currently ongoing within the industry. Historically, PV industry intellectual property claims, particularly related to crystalline silicon technologies, and especially among Chinese headquarter producers, have been limited and seldom asserted. This has largely been due to the understanding that cell related technology advancements were effectively open source with patents and knowhow freely shared within the Chinese manufacturing ecosystem. Today's intellectual property landscape within the solar manufacturing sector has clearly changed. As shown on Slide 5, a number of leading manufacturers are asserting patent related claims against one another. Notably, a number of these actions are focused on alleged infringement of TOPCon patents. As just one example. Earlier this month, Trina filed a section 337 complaint at the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, against the floods of Runergy and Adani. According to the complaint, Trina is seeking to exclude TOPCon solar cells modules and components from importation into the United States due to alleged patent infringement, which the ITC is now investigating. As disclosed earlier in the third quarter, First Solar also possesses a TOPCon patent portfolio through our acquisition of TetraSun in 2013, which we have begun to leverage as part of our ongoing efforts to develop the next generation of PV technologies. Our TOPCon portfolio includes patents and patent applications in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, and United Arab Emirates with patent terms extending to 2030. Note regarding the India market, although First Solar does not possess a TOPCon patent in India, several jurisdictions where we do have patents are sourcing India bound cell manufacturing and exports. We believe we'll be able to assert our patent rights in these jurisdictions against manufacturers and exporters of infringing India bound products. While a number of other market participants are claiming they too own TOPCon patents, it is important to note that as with any mature technology, it is not unusual that multiple key patents may be held by multiple and related parties.  Without ownership or license covering every relevant patent used in the manufacturing process, a manufacturer does not have the freedom to produce and sell an otherwise infringing product.  Since our April -- since our July announcement regarding First Solar's TOPCon patent portfolio, we have advanced our investigation into several crystalline silicon solar manufacturers for potential infringement of our patents. The result of these efforts has enhanced our conviction that we possess fundamentally valid and enforceable patents in relation to TOPCon cell technology. To that end, we have recently begun sending letters to various solar manufacturers shown on Slide 5. Under the letterhead of a law firm with one of the world's leading intellectual property practices, providing notice to each recipient that they are using First Solar's TOPCon patents without a license and reserving First Solar's rights in their entirety. We are currently in negotiation with multiple interested parties and rights to our TOPCon patent portfolio. Finally, during the third quarter we achieved a victory upholding the validity of our Chinese TOPCon patents in the Patent Reexamination and Invalidation Department or PRID of the China National Intellectual Property Administration, which is the patent office in China. The PRID upheld the validity of all 17 claims of our Chinese TOPCon patent against a number of asserted prior art references. Together with our aforementioned outreach to manufacturers aimed at discussing potential structures to authorize the actual or planned use of our TOPCon patents. Our recent victory in China provides third party validation of the strength of our TOPCon patent portfolio. First Solar has long held a commitment to fundamental concepts of respect for the integrity of property rights. As shown on Slide 5 and reflected in numerous public announcements and public reporting over the past year, First Solar is not alone in seeking to protect its intellectual property rights, with a number of other leading manufacturers taking actions to protect their rights as well.  To the extent these manufacturers, the majority of which are Chinese based, continue to report significant financial loss in their race to the bottom. It is reasonable to expect that they will continue to aggressively assert these claims. We believe the IP-based uncertainty surrounding crystalline silicon manufacturers' freedom to manufacture and sell TOPCon solar products and the potential complications for a PV project utilizing potentially infringing solar cells should be taken in consideration by developers, project owners, and PPA off-takers, as well as debt and tax equity financing parties. In addition, we believe the current intellectual property landscape, particularly as it relates to TOPCon cell technology, underscores one of First Solar's key competitive differentiators of delivering a unique proprietary homegrown cadmium telluride semiconductor technology, in contrast to the highly commoditized crystal and silicon modules. I'll now turn the call over to Alex to discuss our bookings, pipeline and financials. Alex Bradley : Thanks, Mark. Beginning on Slide 6. As of December 31st, 2023, a contracted backlog totaled 78.3 gigawatts with an aggregate value of $23.3 billion. Through September 30, 2024, we had recognized 9 gigawatts of sold volume and contracted an additional 3.5 gigawatts. This includes a reduction to our bookings of 0.4 gigawatts due to the termination of a contract with Plug Power. A former corporate customer who experienced delays their project as first noted on our earnings call in February of this year. After significant attempts to negotiate, a mutually beneficial solution failed and we were unable to renegotiate the contract to our satisfaction. In Q3, we elected to terminate the contract and pursue our contractually agreed termination remedies. This brings our total backlog to 72.8 gigawatts at quarter end with an aggregate value of $21.7 billion, implying an ASP of approximately $0.298 per watt, excluding adjusters were applicable. Since the end of the third quarter, we've entered into an additional 0.5 gigawatts of contracts increasing our total backlog to 73.3 gigawatts. What about ASPs for our 0.8 gigawatts of gross bookings since the prior earnings call, this includes approximately 180 megawatts of domestic India shipments and an ASP of approximately $0.19 per watt. And given the India market pricing environment, I'll further discuss our strategy as it relates to sales of our India produced product shortly. It also includes the booking for 50 megawatts of aged low bin inventory that would not be usable by our traditional utility scale customer base, and that would otherwise be scrapped to be sold for a non-traditional contracting arrangement. Structures a true non-contingent sale with a module distributor at an initial ASP of $0.05 per watt. We expect to receive upside revenue sharing based on the final sale price, which we were reflected as incremental revenue at the time of sale to the end user. The remaining approximately 560 megawatts of bookings to our traditional U.S. utility scale customer base is at an ASP of approximately $0.304 per watt, excluding adjusters, or up to $0.32 for what, assuming the realization of adjusters were applicable. As it relates to the U.S. utility scale market. The updated domestic content bonus, Safe Harbor Guidance issued by the Department of Treasury and IRS in May, 2024, sets out a more practical points based calculation rather than a cost-based calculation for a renewable energy project to qualify for the bonus, placing a high value on vertically integrated manufacturing utilizes domestically procured components. The profile exemplified by First Solar's growing domestic manufacturing operations. Given the high domestic content embedded in our U.S. produced Series 6 and Series 7 modules, which critically feature a domestically manufactured cell and which may incorporate domestic components for all the points eligible components specified in the elective safe harbor in the May, 2024 updated guidance. Our production fleet greatly enables our customer's ability to satisfy the domestic content bonus criteria. Under the new elective safe harbor, there are opportunities for First Solar to optimize its supply chain and allocation strategy, including with deliveries to customers and modules produced across our global fleet. This approach allows us to optimize our production base, while ensuring that our customers receive the points necessary for them to qualify for and critically finance the domestic content bonus. To that end, during the quarter, we began effecting this optimization strategy to amend contracts, while maintaining the ASP under the original module sale agreement. A substantial portion of our backlog includes opportunities to increase the base ASP through the application of adjusters, if we realize achievements within our current technology roadmap as of the expected timing for delivery of the product. At the end of third quarter, we had approximately 37.3 gigawatts of contracted volume with these adjusters, which if fully realized could result in additional revenue of up to approximately $0.7 billion or approximately $0.02 per watt, majority of which will be recognized between 2026 and 2028. This amount does not include potential adjustments, which are generally applicable to the total contracted backlog, both the ultimate module been delivered to the customer, which may adjust the ASP in the sales contract upwards or downwards, and for increases in sales rate or applicable aluminum or steel commodity price changes. Reflected on Slide 7, our total pipeline of potential bookings remains strong with bookings opportunities totaling 81.4 gigawatts, an increase of approximately 0.8 gigawatts since the previous quarter. Our mid-to-late stage bookings opportunity decreased by approximately 5.1 gigawatts to 23.5 gigawatts, and that includes 20.9 gigawatts in North America and 2.3 gigawatts in India. Within our mid-to-late stage pipeline, 3.9 gigawatts of opportunities that are contract and subject to conditions precedent, including in the U.S. a 620-megawatt module supply grid with a customer that we supply in power to our hyperscaler, as referenced on our last earnings call and 0.8 gigawatts in India. As a reminder, signed contracts in India would not be recognized as bookings till we receive full security against the offtake. And note that we've reduced our opportunities that our contract is subject to conditions precedent for India by 0.4 gigawatts as a result of terminating a defaulted module supply agreement with an India affiliate of a European oil major, who is reportedly in the process of selling this business. Improving our revenues for the third quarter is a contractual termination payment associated with the custom default under this contract. As stated on previous earnings calls, given our diminished available supply through 2027, the long-dated time frame into which we're now selling, the need to align customer project visibility with our balanced approach to ASPs, payment security, and other key contractual terms. And given the uncertainty related to policy environment due to the upcoming U.S. election, we'll continue to leverage our position of strength in our contracted backlog and be highly selective in our approach to new bookings this year. We intend to continue forward contracts with customers who prioritize long-term relationships and appropriately value our points of differentiation. On Slide 8, I'll cover our financial results for the third quarter. Net sales in the third quarter were $0.9 billion decrease of $0.1 billion compared to the second quarter. Decrease in net sales was driven by a 12% decrease in the volume of megawatts sold and the aforementioned increase in our Series 7 product warranty liability, partly offset by expected payments associated with contract terminations in the U.S. and India. Gross margin was 50% in the third quarter compared to 49% in the second quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to higher contract termination payments and a higher mix of modules sold from our US factories, which led to $264 million of Section 45X tax credits during the period, partially offset by the aforementioned increase in our Series 7 product warranty liability, higher underutilization charges and additional inventory reserves for lower bin modules manufactured by international factories. During the third quarter, we experienced certain planned downtime for CuRe technology upgrades, as well as the unplanned downtime for the CrowdStrike event and various other operational challenges which I described shortly, and equipment repairs. We also incurred certain underutilization charges that our new factory in Alabama as we began ramping production during the period. SG&A, R&D and production started expenses totaled $123 million in the third quarter decrease of approximately $3 million compared to the second quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower R&D testing expenses as we sought to maximize production throughput, while transitioning certain testing activities to our recently dedicated Jim Nolan Center for Solar Innovation, along with a reduction incentive compensation expenses. Our third quarter operating income was $322 million, which included depreciation, amortization and accretion of $111 million, ramp cost of $25 million, production startup expense of $27 million and share-based compensation expense of $7 million. Third quarter, other income was $5 million, which was consistent with the second quarter. Tax expense for third quarter was $14 million compared to $28 million in the second quarter. This decrease was driven by higher forecasted income in lower tax jurisdictions, and the second quarter change in our position related to reinvesting the accumulated earnings of a foreign subsidiary, which resulted in an additional tax expense in the prior period. Combination of the aforementioned items led to third quarter earnings per diluted share $2.91. Next turn to Slide 9 to discuss select balance sheet items and summary cash flow information. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by capital expenditures associated with our new U.S. factories in Alabama and Louisiana along with an increase in working capital. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $582 million, an increase of $23 million from the second quarter as a result of higher working capital loans in India, which helped support the continued ramp of our new plant in the region. Our net cash position decreased by approximately $0.5 billion to $0.7 billion as a result of the aforementioned factors. Cash flows used in operations were $54 million in the third quarter, and capital expenditures were $434 million during the period. Continuing on to Slide 10, I'd like to provide some context to our financial guidance update. Our full year P&L guidance, first issued in February remained unchanged through our Q1 and Q2 earnings call in May and July, respectively. However, in July, we noted that following the termination for convenience of 0.4 gigawatts of contracted capacity by a European power and utilities customer, who is selling a portfolio of U.S. development assets, we expected volumes sold revenue and net cash guidance to be towards the bottom end of our guidance range. As it relates to our updated guidance, there are several drivers of the forecast changes. Firstly, since our last earnings call where we referenced the global CrowdStrike IT outage, which temporarily idled our fleet for approximately 2 days, we have experienced a number of additional operational challenges. These include hurricanes Francine, Helene and Milton which made landfall across the Southeastern United States, impacting the early module deliveries within the region, but also our Louisiana factory construction, as well as causing logistical impact at our distribution centers in South Carolina and Texas. These distribution centers, along with other transport infrastructure, including the ports themselves were also affected by the International Longshoreman Association strike. In addition, an external security alert at our Ohio location while ultimately unsubstantiated resulted in full evacuation of the facilities with adverse consequences to schedule production output. Each of these events whilst not individually material have in totality had an adverse impact on operational and financial performance. Secondly, as it relates to India, as referenced on both our Q1 and Q2 earnings calls, we continue to remain concerned by Chinese dumping into the Indian market, which has led to an artificially low and challenged ASP environment for domestic sales. In response to this behavior, which threatens India's aspirations to end its reliance on an adversary by developing a domestic manufacturing base that serves a domestic market, the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recently initiated an antidumping investigation into solar cell imports from China. However, despite this investigation, domestic India ASPs remain depressed as a function of this dumping behavior, and as reflected by the approximately $0.19 per watt ASP for our recent India bookings discussed earlier. With such artificially depressed ASPs in the India market, we see the updated Safe Harbor guidance for the IRA domestic content bonus released in May 2024, providing us with an opportunity to shift India production from fixed tilt to tracker product and ship a portion of our future Indian manufactured product into the US market at higher ASPs. Net of incremental production and freight costs, we expect shipping this product to the US to be gross margin accretive relative to domestic India sales. However, given transit and delivery times to the US market, we expect this to reduce the volume of product produced by our India factory and sold in 2024 by approximately 0.9 gigawatts. Thirdly, and as again previously noted on our earnings call this year, we have seen some requests from customers to shift delivery volume timing out as a function of project development delays. We continue to work with our customers to optimize the delivery schedules for their contracted volumes to the extent we are able to accommodate them. This has been a driver of the back ending of revenue and gross margin to Q4 of this year. In some cases, we are enforcing our contractual rights to ship modules to warehouses in the event that customers are not ready to receive the product as scheduled under the contract. In other cases, we are able to accommodate schedule shifts either through reallocation to another customer or through interim storage of the module. Despite the termination of the Plug Power contract, the 0.4 gigawatts of modules, originally assumed to be sold this year, and a recent request increase for delivery schedule flexibility, we have largely been able to mitigate the impact to our sold volume guidance, which is modestly reduced by approximately 0.3 gigawatts. Fourthly, we continue to enforce our contractual rights in the event of contractual breach. The aforementioned Plug Power contract termination resulted in a termination payment entitlement recognized as revenue in the third quarter. Additionally, during the quarter, we enforced our termination rights under 2 contracts in India, which also resulted in termination payment entitlements recognized as revenue in Q3. While cash and other liquid security deposits cover a portion of these payments, order to collect the balance owed, we expect to litigate. To that end, we have filed a complaint against Plug Power and commenced arbitration proceedings against one Indian customer, and we anticipate initiating arbitration proceedings against the second Indian customer, in all cases seeking to enforce our full termination payment rights on the respective contracts. The combined effect of these impacts would serve to reduce our full-year 2024 volume sold revenue and net cash guidance numbers below those provided on our Q2 earnings call in July, with the contractual termination payments largely offsetting the reduced sold volume, resulting in gross margin, operating income and earnings per diluted share guidance within the previous ranges provided.  So with this context in mind and together with the impact of the aforementioned $50 million product warranty charge related to the initial production of our new Series 7 products, our updated guidance ranges are as follows. We expect volumes sold of 14.2 to 14.6 gigawatts, resulting in net sales guidance of between $4.1 billion and $4.25 billion. Gross margin is expected to be between $1.95 billion and $2 billion, which includes $1.02 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45x tax credits and $60 million to $75 million of ramp costs. SG&A expenses are expected to be $445 million to $475 million, which includes $185 million to $195 million of SG&A expense, $190 million to $200 million of R&D expense, and $70 million to $80 million of production start-up expenses. Operating income is expected to be between $1.48 billion and $1.54 billion and is inclusive of $130 million to $155 million of combined ramp costs and plant startup expenses and $1.02 billion to $1.05 billion of Section 45x tax credits. We expect interest income, interest expense, other income and tax expense to net to a total expense of approximately $80 million. This results in a full year 2024 earnings per diluted share guidance range of $13 to $13.50. Capital expenses are forecasted to be between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion, a reduction of $250 million to $350 million from the prior forecast is largely as a result of the timing of payments related to capacity expansion and R&D initiatives. Our year-end 2024 net cash balance is anticipated to be between $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion as a result of the aforementioned changes to volumes sold in revenue and the timing of receivables, partially offset by reductions in capital expenditures. Now I'll hand the call back to Mark for his concluding message. Mark Widmar : All right. Thanks, Alex. As you all know, a week from today, U.S. voters go to polls and our industry is focused on the results and potential implication of those results. While we cannot predict the outcome of the upcoming elections, we are optimistic about the impact of our work to constructively engage with and informed policymakers across the political spectrum about the economic and strategic benefits of high-value domestic manufacturing. We are further optimistic that regardless of the results. We are continuing to build a company that endeavors to exit this decade in a stronger position than when it entered it. As we've said before, we are not immune from the long-standing challenges resulting from the continued irrational pricing and reckless capacity expansion behavior of the Chinese nominated crystalline silicon industry, and we must remain nimble in the face of near-term challenges, presented by matters such as project development delays, particularly here in the United States market. That said, by continuing to execute a strategy of disciplined growth underpinned by demand and resiliency in our order backlog, and when necessary, and only after collaborative spirited efforts of accessible accommodations cannot be reached, we will vigorously enforce our commitments. By continued investment in capital and research and development to advance the next-generation of thin film photovoltaics, which we believe presents the future of this industry, by advancing technology leadership through the development of strategic intellectual property portfolios and leverage those rights, and by our long-standing advocacy for the development and enforcement of laws that level the playing field for domestic high-value manufacturing that today are arguably within the central policy position on both sides of the aisle. By continuing to deliver upon our commitments and our history of providing certainty to our customers, which includes making efforts to do right by our customers on those occasions when we fall short of delivering on those commitments. And by adhering to our decision-making framework of balancing growth, profitability, and liquidity, we believe First Solar is positioned to not only maintain, but to build upon our more than 25 years of industry leadership. To conclude, Alex will now summarize the key messages from today's call on Slide 11. Alex Bradley : We continue to be disciplined in our approach to contracting with 4 gigawatts of net bookings year to date leading to resilient contracted backlog of 73.3 gigawatts. Our continued focus on manufacturing technology excellence resulted in a record quarterly production of 3.8 gigawatts. Our Alabama factory commenced operations and our Louisiana factory remains on schedule. From a technology perspective, we expect to launch our CuRe lead line and commission our perovskite development line in Q4 of this year. We also sent letters to certain solar manufacturers providing notice that they're using First Solar's TOPCon patents without a license and reserve First Solar's rights in their entirety. Financially, we earned $2.91 per diluted share. We ended the quarter with a gross cash balance of $1.3 billion or $0.7 billion net of debt. We're revising our full-year 2024 guidance with full-year earnings to diluted share guidance of $13 to $13.50. And with that, we can do that for better remarks and open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Philip Shen, ROTH Capital Partners. Philip Shen : Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First one is on the chips ITC. There was news recently that wafer and ingots, facilities can take advantage of that in the U.S. And our check suggests that you guys have a door to perhaps tap into that. And so I was wondering if that's the case, do you think the recent facilities that you've brought online over the past couple of years could qualify. And then also if you can opine on whether or not you think you can get that, that'd be great. Shifting over to bookings price, it sounds like it was $0.304 per watt on the incremental 400 megawatts. That's down a touch from the prior quarter. Can you comment on why and then what do you expect there and then finally, sorry to throw so many, with India we understand what you're doing with the unsold modules. But on a go-forward basis, do you think you lower the India facility utilization? Or do you think you what is the utilization at now? And do you continue to operate it at that level or even higher ahead. Mark Widmar : All right, Phil. I will take the first and the last one. I will let Alex talk about the bookings ASP. As it relates to the chip ITC and applicability to wake facilities that was recently announced. Clearly, we're very much engaged and aware, and we're evaluating the potential capability to our facilities. What I would say in general is the spirit of what we've seen in a lot of the intent of the IRAs to be technology neutral, and to allow for various technologies to receive the same similar types of benefits. We saw that on the manufacturing tax rate, the 45X, right. So there's $0.17 or so of value for the equivalent journey from a wafer to a cell to a module for crystalline silicon to other technology like thin films, which is whether it's today's cad tel thin film or the future of perovskite thin film. So the intent in spirit was to provide equivalency across those respective technologies, not advantage one technology over the next. Clearly, we're very happy that this decision has been made. I think it helps create that vertically integrated supply chain that we believe we need to make this enduring. And that was the intent of IRAs to enable this opportunity to transition to a domestic industry and to be vertically integrated in the supply chain. We will continue to be actively engaged and to see to the extent that we can qualify for those benefits and potentially happen to be applicable to our Alabama and Louisiana facilities in particular. I'll take the India conversation and then pass it back to Alex on the bookings ASP. Look, as it relates to India, we're in a transitionary period for that domestic market. There is -- obviously, China is doing everything it's doing globally, and it's not discriminating on any particular market, and it has such excess capacity, and it's dumping at extreme levels right now that does make it difficult for domestic industries to compete with imports. The -- what we're seeing in India is cell and wafer in particular, is at levels that make it uneconomical to manufacture domestically and to compete with the value of those imports even in the case where there's tariffs that are associated with them. That's starting to change. There's actually an antidumping case that's been taken up right now on cells to evaluate that exact behavior and impact and we're optimistic that, that will move forward in a constructive way. As we've mentioned before that there's also the equivalent of the approved list of module manufacturers that the intent is to now move that to cell manufacturers that would create non-trade barrier for imports coming from China in particular. The intent is that, that would be up and running by the end of Q1 of 2026. So they're doing a lot of things to transition in the market, which we think is healthy. We are -- we will continue to be focused on the domestic market, and we will be selective in the opportunities in which we engage if we can get prices which we believe are appropriate for the technology and value that we're creating. In the interim though, we have the opportunity to export that same technology, but for the mounting system. So the product in India is largely fixed tilt. We will be making a tracker product to ship it into the U.S. market. So again, the mounting structure is slightly different, but effectively the same technology, same product when we're shipping that into the U.S. market. And we're optimistic that we can take between the combination of getting strong prices in the U.S. market and respectable pricing and being selected and limited opportunities in India, and we'll continue to run India at its full utilization. Today, as we transition to the tracker product, it is running at its full utilization. The tracker -- the fixed cell product we were running in Q3 was at a level below the full absorption. And so we did see some underutilization charges for that India facility. But where we are today, it is running at full utilization to make a tracker product that will support the U.S. market. Alex Bradley : Yes. And Phil on the ASPs, I wouldn't read into anything on where that 30.4% ASP is just given how smaller volume we're booking. And that's a function of that disciplined selective approach that we talked about. But just to clarify on the volumes, I think you said 0.4. So it's 0.4 gigawatts of net bookings. We did have the plug debooking in there of 0.4. So it's 0.8 of gross bookings. Within that, there's about 180 megawatts of India volume and then about 50 megawatts of volume that is going into the U.S., but it's a lot of old low-bin inventory that otherwise would likely have been scrapped. And we're selling that under a construct where it's recognized today as a booking at a very low ASP $0.05. But what ultimately happened is the person we're selling that to will then go out and sell that into the market and there's a revenue sharing. So ultimately, we'll get a much higher price for that, but today it gets recognized at that lower number. So what you're seeing is actually about 0.6 gigawatts or so, a little under 600 megawatts of new U.S. bookings and that's what that 30.4 relates to. And again that number is also pre-adjusted. So with adjusted on top of that, a lot of that volume being booked into a timeframe where we will have technology adjusted that goes up to $0.32. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Lee, Goldman Sachs. Brian Lee : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a follow-up to Phil's question for you, Mark. I know it might be tough to answer specifically, but on the Q1 call, you guys had said. I think it was 2.6 gigawatts of production in India, shipping 1 gigawatt plus to the U.S. and then presumably the rest shipping domestically in India. Clearly, that calculus is changing here. So can you give us a sense of what that mix would look like going forward? And then how many quarters it does take to reengineer and then reallocate that India volume back to the US where it sounds like you're going to take advantage of better pricing. And then just on the rest of your guidance, it seems if you do the math, it's 5.4 gigawatts or so in that neighborhood of sold volume in Q4. It's significantly higher than any run rate you've seen in the past would be a record. How derisked do you see that, volume sold level, especially in the context of you mentioning some push outs and things that maybe aren't staying on customer timelines as you might have initially anticipated. Mark Widmar : Yes, So Brian, as it relates to India and ability to flex and to move from a fixed to a tracked product. And it's the timing from within the factory, you've got a day or so of couple of days of downtime. So to move again, the only delta we're making is the mounting structure on the back. So instead of being a steel rail that accommodates a fixed structure, it's a steel rail that accommodates a tracker mounting. There is some timing that you have to work with your supply chain to make sure that your rail supplier, in particular pivots from one spec to another spec. So there's a little bit of notice to our supply chain to give them a heads up. But the ability to toggle back and forth is we got to a point where we're pretty nimble. Now we worked a lot on that to make sure that we could our back-end assembly process and take there and our pack out to accommodate the flexibility in programming the robots as well as the automated guided vehicles and everything to toggle back and forth very quickly depending on the mix of product that we want to manufacture. So we've gotten pretty good at doing that. And Brian, in terms of the opportunity, the way especially with the new point system, we've got we'll have 14 gigawatts of Series 7 capacity. And it's very easy to blend Series 7 domestic with Series 7 international, at the same in the same projects, right. They're the same products. There's no uniqueness of either product. As we transition across our road map, we'll have to be mindful of how we transition domestic factories with international factories. So if we make a BiFi product with Series 7, we're going to want to make sure that at least for the blending of the across the geographies, we'll want to make sure India is also producing a BiFi product because it's uneconomical really or it's just not ideal to make a BiFi product domestically and a mono-facial product internationally and then put them in the same projects. And it's not the ultimate outcome of what you would try to accomplish. But ability is flexible. We intend to run the factory full out probably. If I had to give you a view longer term, given what we're seeing on pricing if things do stabilize and move in a more positive direction, I would say, over the next couple of years, it's probably going to be less than 1 gigawatt for sure in India, and the balance was going to come into the U.S. market. But we'll optimize that against underlying fundamental demand in the introspective market. As it relates to the fourth quarter and the implied [indiscernible]. But there's continued risk each and every day with scheduled movements and shifts and what have you. But we have coordinated with our customers to understand where they are in terms of their projects for receipt of modules. And to the extent that they are seeing some delays on their part, we're moving towards moving those into warehouses. But in some cases, it may be in our warehouse and then charging the customer for that warehousing costs or it could be at their respective warehouse. And it's just under the premise of enforcing [indiscernible] rights of the contract. As Alex indicated and I indicated in my remarks as well, we will continue to be accommodated and flexible where we can. But at this point in time, given the inventory build that we have over the first 3 quarters of this year, we need to move that inventory to other locations and hopefully into projects, but it's not to a customer located warehouse. Alex Bradley : And Brian, just a couple of other comments on that. So as we begin ramping up CuRe at the back end of this year, we are assuming that volume gets sold and it's not a significant amount of volume. But as with any ramp, you've got risk around early production and just given its U.S. volume and have IRA dollars attached to it, even small amount of volume there can have some more material impact to dollars. So that's one risk. And the other I would say is, as we noted on the call, we have seen operational challenges, a lot of those from outside events, including weather events. And so as you start to ship more and especially as we look at the back end of the year, any event like that can have a greater impact as we're trying to get more product out of the door but it goes to two other things just to bear in mind as we think through the guidance for Q4. Operator : Up next, we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Jefferies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : If I can follow up on a couple of things. First, small detail, coming out of the queue, just with respect to the S7 manufacturing warranty piece you kind of alluded to some ongoing risk. Have you fully remediated the backdrop here around the $50 million warranty liability? I just wanted to get a little bit more color there and more specifically, comfort level on resolving that prospectively. And then if I could the second question and then related to it. Going back to what you were talking about a second ago with respect to India, just want to understand the safe harbor dialogue and what you anticipate doing here. Is there a potential to effectively swap in panels maybe from a different origin than what had been previously contemplated? Is this a net increase in overall blending of foreign panels in? Or is it just about providing greater latitude on where those panels are coming from? I just want to make sure I understood exactly what you were saying there. Mark Widmar : Yes. Okay. First off, on the warranty, I'll provide a little bit more color just because there may be other questions as well. So I also want to -- I think I may have summon over in my prepared remarks, and I may have referenced Series 6, and I'm glad Julien, you picked up Series 7, and that's clearly what Alex indicated and also what's in the -- in our filings. So this is a manufacturing issue that's specific to our initial production of Series 7. It is an issue that there is variability in terms of the production process that will impact some modules, and in some cases, it won't impact other models. So in some cases, we may see a shortfall in performance. In other cases, there may be no underperformance. It's an issue that generally needs to be identified after the modules have been deployed and they're in the field, so we can observe what is happening. And then to the extent that there is a shortfall in field, then we'll bring them in and we'll do lab testing if required to determine if there is a warrantable claim or not. There's two primary issues, both relate up to the start up to of a new technology. The first one, and these are more -- these are manufacturing issues, and I want to make sure there's clarity around this. It's not a reflection of anything, any type of defect or performance problem associated with the fundamental device. What happened with our initial start-up, we have a process when we drop the first piece of glass into the manufacturing process? And what we do is we actually grind the edges of the glass. And actually on the corners, we'll round them. There can be residual chemicals or other particles that can get onto the glass. So the very next step in the production process is to wash it. And Series 7 has a longer we refer to it as a dwell time. So the time between the completion of the grind to when the actual module is washed. And as a result of that, some of the materials were effectively calcifying onto the glass, and we could not properly clean them through the wash process. So this was what ultimately led to what we are starting to see in the field. It's an easy remediation and we have remediated. And we just changed the washing process to make sure that after the grind process that we are properly washing the module and removing all the intended particles and any residual chemicals that may come out as part of the grind process. So that's the first one. And that has been remediated. The other one was effectively referred to as an engineering performance margin. Anytime when we launch a product, we have to do extensive reliability tests, quality tests, which is done mainly in a lab and a lot of it is done through accelerated testing to determine the prediction of future field performance. This is also data that we share with independent engineers and others as they also as we work through our qualification process for a particular technology or a particular product. What happened here is we effectively had an error in the calculation. So the calculation of the engineering performance margin was underrepresented. We found this out through, again, testing of modules and return from the field and determined that, yes, we had an error in our calculation. We had to change our engineering performance margin, which that has been changed as well. So both of the fundamental issues that were identified have been corrected and remediated. And current production right now will obviously not have the adverse implications we had upon the initial launch that we saw with Series 7. Look, I also want to put it in perspective, it's only been a little over a year since we started shipping Series 7. While we do deploy modules into test sites, it is there are only a few dozens of models that get deployed into a test site. And when you have variability in your manufacturing process, you won't really see the complete variation that you have through your production process until the models are actually deployed into the field. And that's effectively what's happened here. And so we've gotten test data now that we've concluded that there are will be incremental charges to our warranty because of those performance issues that effectively escaped our quality operating system. But we've taken corrective action to address, and we've taken corrective action to create a more robust resiliency to our overall QoS system that we have. And again, I want to emphasize, this is not fundamental to the device. This is simple. One is a calculation error and the other is the manufacturing process that we didn't fully understand as we did work through our change management system, the impact of a lot of dwell time between wash -- excuse me, grinded wash would have an adverse implication into the field. It did not show up into our accelerated testing. It did not show up in any of our performance testing that we do before we ship modules. This is something that only manifests itself into the field. We're very happy that we caught it. We will stand behind our technology and address everything we need to with our customers, and we've corrected the problem going forward. Operator : We'll take the next question from Kashy Harrison, Piper Sandler. Kashy Harrison : So just two quick ones. It feels like perhaps there's going to be a broader strategic pivot towards sending -- maybe not quite the 25 gig as well close to the 25 gigs of product eventually to the U.S. in coming years. Based on your discussions with the customers, do you think that the U.S. market will have enough demand to absorb these volumes? And then just one quick follow-up on the CuRe plan. Just wondering how we should think about the CuRe gigawatts that could be recognized next year, the ASP uplift and then the incremental margins for CuRe? Mark Widmar : As it relates to the U.S. market and fundamental demand for -- in the U.S. market for the output, you're right. I mean, with the current trajectory that we're on and with our contracted backlog, there's a good match between -- especially across '25 and '26 as it relates to available supply and fundamental demand that would consume any of that product that we intend to bring into the Indian market. Now we were very -- where we are right now is we're in a very strong position even in '27 from a demand standpoint relative to our U.S. bookings. We do need to think through '27 as it relates to incremental U.S. demand or, again, hopefully getting to a point in time by 2027, where we see a more robust market in India, and we get to a more balanced view of supply/demand, the production facility in India to accommodate the U.S. -- or excuse me, the India market. But I think if we ultimately half and half, I have to bring to [indiscernible] to [ get 75 ] in the U.S. market, at least fundamentally right now, what we're seeing is pretty strong demand in order to make that happen. And again, the nice thing about this is we're still enabling the domestic content value creation with our customers. That's the value that they're willing to pay for. And we also believe that the domestic content criteria will evolve, and I think most of you have seen some of the information that's been out there that the wafer, there will be some modifications that will include the wafer in terms of the domestic content calculation. Therefore, in order to qualify, you would need a U.S. wafer in order to get the value of the cell, which means that the module points conceptually will be worth more, at least the value that we contribute because we're fully vertically integrated, which gives us an opportunity to optimize the blend between the domestic and international mix of products. So yes, we're -- I think as I look across '25, '26, we're in good shape. We [indiscernible] to evaluate how things evolve in '27, but at least our initial take right now is if India market will be more resilient by '27, we'll pull some of that demand out of the U.S. market, but the portion of that is targeted to the U.S. market. Our current view is as we'd be able to consume that entire demand that we save for 2027. Alex Bradley : Yes. As it relates to CuRe, so we said on the call that there are about $0.7 billion of adjusters, most of which are relevant to 2026, '27, '28. So we also said that CuRe, we're going to launch lead line at the end of this year, will produce just under 0.5 gigawatt of product end of this year into Q1. And then we will go and do field performance testing around that product, and then CuRe will launch again towards the end of 2025 in Phase 2. So that middle period we're doing the field testing, but also that's a period where we wouldn't see significant upside associated with the CuRe product. Hence going back to producing current product, and then the aim there is to have CuRe produced across not just the Ohio plant at the back end of '25, but moving across the fleet in time to start capturing the upside from those contractual revenue adjustments going into 2026. Operator : And our final question today will come from Andrew Percoco, Morgan Stanley. Andrew Percoco : Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess I want to come back to the guidance for volumes sold for the year. It sounds like a majority of the reduction was a result of some of the operational challenges you've had plus some of the India headwinds that you're facing, but didn't hear too much in terms of U.S. based project delays influencing that guidance. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from customers in terms of their request for delays? Is the duration getting extended? I think you guys have historically talked about getting requests in the several week timeframe for delays. Are you seeing things get pushed 6 months to a year just given the uncertainty of the election? I'm just hoping to get more context in terms of what you're seeing from customers on the project delay side. Alex Bradley : Yes. I'll start. Maybe Mark will add his color. So on the guide the low end of the guide before was 15.6. And we said on the last call that we expect it to be towards the low end of the guide given the termination that we had in Q2. We brought the midpoint of the guide down now to 14.4, so it's a 1.2 reduction. Just under a gig of that is related to India. And as I said as we said on the call, a large piece of that has to do with where pricing is in India today. And at the same time, we see the opportunity to bring that volume into the US at much better ASP. So you've got a challenging market in India right now, but at the same time, given the domestic content guidance, we can bring that in and actually see a significant margin uplift associated with that. The challenge though is that we have to produce tracker products. So we have some products in inventory in India that's fixed tilt product, which will be sold into the India market. Mark made the comment, it only takes a few days to turn the factory over into producing the tracker product. But now producing that, putting on a boat, getting into the U.S., getting it sold, you're not going to see that sold volume hitting this year, which is why that guide came down. As it relates to other product, non-India product, I mean, we largely managed to mitigate the risks that we've seen throughout the year. So we had the Plug Power termination that was about 0.4 gigawatt impact and actually we're only down 0.3 on non-India volume. So we managed to mitigate even a piece of that and almost everything else. Now, we are shipping some product into warehouses to Mark's comment earlier. I think we said the same in the prepared remarks. In some cases, if customers are not ready or if their projects are not ready, we are acting to do that as we can under our contract because we have commitments we've made for the year. But I would say in general, we have seen a little bit more in terms of a few more requests to move product and some of that request has been incrementally longer than before. And generally, we are trying to work with our customers where we can. But we're also sticking to contracts where we need to and enforcing the ability to ship. So I would say there's a little bit more in the U.S. I think there's a little bit around interconnection and project delays. I don't think we've really seen financing be an issue in U.S. projects. It's mostly around other development items. As I said, we've largely been able to mitigate that either through shipping to warehouses or through reallocation. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our final question today. That also does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation today.
